"artfacts","Aes+F - Inverso Mundus","AES+F is best known for its unique aesthetic sense, which combines historical and mythical references with the contemporary imagery of urban landscapes. In its collaborative, ambitious projects, AES+F uses sets of references, rather than individual ones, drawn from the worlds of architecture, fashion and design. These created environments and spaces are elevated to become characters in the narrative. Generating symbolic compositions in which every element has been carefully planned within a broader, sophisticated narrative, the collective delicately orchestrates scenes where familiar elements become estranged.
The plot of ""Inverso Mundus"", a 38-minute film, is inspired on the genre of World Upside Down engravings, known for satirically depicting surreal scenes in which the natural order of the world, including social roles, were inverted. Widely circulated in Europe since the 16th century, these prints used a series of brief vignettes, where animals are riding people and slaves are served by their masters, among others, as a way of critiquing social order.
Reminiscent of the medieval tradition of carnivals rooted in the Saturnalia -- an ancient Roman festival dedicated to Saturn -- the World Upside Down engravings, allowed a space for social commentary, but also, they became a place for artistic potential where a contradictory world could emerge. Such style, brought into fine arts with painting masters like Hieronymous Bosch and Goya endorsed compositions with a unique poetic sense where the absurd and grotesque create a new kind of aesthetic vision. In the same manner, AES+F offers through ""Inverso Mundus"" a reinterpretation of contemporary life, a ""light hearted contemporary apocalypse.""
Adapted for the Experimental Gallery at the SCAD Museum of Art as a pan-optic experience and accompanied by a vigorous classical soundtrack, the film is comprised of sequential vignettes. These vignettes feature scenes such as the board of a corporation being overthrown by a group of common people hybrid creatures flying by the skyline of an advanced city; a butcher being slaughtered by a swine; a group of luxuriously dressed women capturing and dominating a group of men; and youngsters physically battling a group of elders, among other equally complex scenes. As a unifying characteristic, the beautiful, statuesque characters presented in the film conduct themselves with dead-pan expression, as well as with particularly cautious movements. Somehow, the interaction between them seems unfinished, more circumstantial than intentional, imbuing each scene with an uncanny atmosphere.
Relying on the power of imagination and critique as a potential site for change, AES+F beautifully questions the validity of social roles of power and subordination, while providing the viewer a potent, immersive audiovisual experience."
"artfacts","Lichtempfindlich 2 Fotografie Aus Der Sammlung Schaufler","Contemporary photography from the Schaufler Collection will be on display from September 2017 at the SCHAUWERK Sindelfingen. The museum will link this show to the LICHTEMPFINDLICH exhibition of 2011, which had presented the large collection of this medium to the public for the first time in the impressive space of the former high rack warehouse in the SCHAUWERK. This lofty storage space inspires with its revolving ramp, which extends over 15 metres upward: an exhibition place par excellence for photography, with spectacular visual axes for viewing from near and afar.
Along with major works from the first exhibition, LICHTEMPFINDLICH 2 will also display photographs that previously haven't been shown, so that a more comprehensive representation of the contemporary photography collection can occur. The main interest of the collectors Peter Schaufler and Christiane Schaufler-Munch is not directed toward the medium and its history per se, but leans more toward the fascination that arises from certain motifs, pictorial inventions, and their formal transformations.
The classic genres of photography--nude, portrait, landscape, architecture, or industry--are mirrored in the works, but are often citations or stages of conceptual processes. Most of the protagonists within the context of this collection have left behind the conventional framework of photography."
"artfacts","Objects Like Us","Objects Like Us, a group exhibition featuring nearly seventy tabletop art objects by more than fifty artists, will open at The Aldrich Contemporary Art Museum in May. This exhibition explores the relational behavior of intimately scaled objects that personify or embody a human condition or attribute. The objects will span nearly sixty years and feature works conceived specifically for the exhibition, including a site-specific floor installation by artist/co-curator David Adamo. The overall experience will underscore the efficacy of the works' relativity and illuminate the interconnectedness of audience and objects. Objects Like Us, is organized by Amy Smith-Stewart, curator at The Aldrich, and Adamo; it will be on view at The Aldrich from May 20, 2018, to January 13, 2019.
Small objects of symbolic prominence exert a special hold. Some purport to possess healing powers, channel spirit gods, or speak to us; others perform for us, mime our mannerisms, or impart notable narratives. Even with the dramatic dematerialization of objects in this hyperkinetic moment, tangible objects of small stature and symptomatic value command sizeable importance in our everyday lives, as they have for tens of thousands of years. We obsessively cram our homes, offices, museums, and galleries with these diminutive objects--whether objects of art, historical worth, ceremony, or of individual accomplishment, all are expressions of us, and thus of broader culture.
In Objects Like Us each work affects or exposes a circumstance, attribute, or manner that is notably human and transmits a potentiality, aura, or agency demonstrative of being. This exhibition brings together art objects that not only parrot human behavior or gestures, but that unequivocally ""interrelate."" It has been conjured as a performative arrangement, with the objects installed in an intentional frontal method of display, positioned on a long shelf that extends over three walls of a rectilinear gallery. Its design combines two common yet neutralized display formats, the table and the shelf, suspending the visitor within a situation that evokes both the home and the museum. Another distinguishing feature of this exhibition is co-curator and artist David Adamo's (b. 1979) eleven-hundred-square-foot, site-specific floor installation, Batons Rompus (2012), comprised entirely of rectangular sticks of white school chalk laid out in a herringbone pattern that mimics vintage parquet. Like all ephemeral works, its vulnerability will be apparent as the chalk inescapably succumbs to day-to-day wear and tear, fracturing and eventually disintegrating under the scores of shuffling feet, enhancing the visitor's sensitivity to site and context while tracking their introspective travels within the gallery."
"artfacts","Takayama Akira - McDonald’s Radio University","MISA SHIN GALLERY is pleased to announce McDonald's Radio University, a solo exhibition by Takayama Akira, from Friday, November 23, 2018 to Saturday, January 19, 2019.
Born in 1969, Takayama Akira is a theater director and artist who embraces a broad range of non-conventional performance methods in a bid to expand the concept of theater within contemporary society. They include installations, touring performances, social experimentation projects, discourse events, sightseeing tours, videos, and many other approaches.
McDonald's Radio University is a project that transforms branches of McDonald's restaurant across a city into lecture spaces, creating a citywide university. The professors are immigrants or refugees who have had to leave their home countries, and the students are people who walk into a McDonald's and order a lecture along with a burger and a coke.
The project was premiered in 2017 across seven McDonald's stores in Frankfurt, Germany. The professors stationed in each of the stores delivered their lectures via lapel mics, ransmitting throughout the store. Students used portable radios and earphones distributed at the counter to tune into their lectures in real time. The professors in Frankfurt were all refugees, coming from countries such as Afghanistan, Syria, Pakistan, Ghana, and Iran, and speaking on a total of fifteen topics encompassing philosophy, music, architecture, biology, natural science, and journalism.
The fast food restaurant McDonald's is renowned as a symbol of global capitalism, and has gained a reputation for serving up unhealthy junk food. Yet in Europe, where class divides and other social divisions are becoming impossible to ignore, it is also a place that welcomes immigrants and refugees as both customers and staff, and a location where many ethnicities, races, religions and ages of people coexist. By taking McDonald's as his setting, Takayama unveils deception that art criticizes social problems from on high, designing his project as a shifting device that can enable us to learn from the world as it really is.
The McDonald's Radio University at MISA SHIN GALLERY takes place not in an actual McDonald's restaurant, but in a re-creation of one. The professors are people who participate as Tokyo tour guides in Takayama's New Tokyo School Excursion Project: Japanese Orphans in China Edition. They are some of the people who, as children, had been left behind in China when their Japanese families were repatriated at the end of the Second World War. Adopted by local families and growing up in China, many faced discrimination after moving to Japan. In addition to this line-up, there will be ten lectures selected from the twenty-five delivered in Frankfurt and Berlin. The exhibition opens on a public holiday, Friday November 23rd, and exhibition visitors will be able to hear the professors speaking live on that first day.
Takayama Akira
Born in 1969. In 2002, he formed the theater company Port B, and since then has been producing installations, touring performances and social experiments utilizing urban spaces as a way of engaging with cities and societies across the world. In recent years, collaboration with those from other fields including visual art, tourism, literature, architecture, and urban researches has seen the scope of his practice broadening further, and he has applied his theatrical philosophy and methodology to opening up new possibilities in a variety of fields. Major works include the Our Songs-Sydney Kabuki Project (Sydney), the Wagner Project (Yokohama), McDonald's Radio University (Frankfurt, Berlin), Tokyo/Heterotopia (Tokyo), Piraeus/Heterotopia (Athens), Beitou/Heterotopia (Taipei), Beirut/Heterotopia (Beirut), Yokohama Commune (Yokohama), Compartment City - Vienna (Vienna), Referendum Project (Tokyo, Fukushima, etc.), and The Complete Manual of Evacuation (Tokyo, Frankfurt). He has participated in major exhibitions, such as Yokohama Triennale (2014), Maison Hermes (2015, Tokyo), Roppongi Crossing (2016, Mori Art Museum, Tokyo), Sharjah Biennial (2017), and Biennale of Sydney (2018). He is an associate professor at the Graduate School of Film and New Media, Tokyo University of the Arts."
"artfacts","Sharjah Biennial 14 Leaving the Echo Chamber","In popular culture the ""Echo Chamber"" is a moniker for circuitous news media and its attendant feeds that are reinforced by a closed system, a network that is controlled and governed by private sources, governments and corporations. It is also a metaphor for the historical dominance of Capital and the cultural, social and political systems which dictate its access, production and distribution - this 'capital' wooing (and thus privileging) particular image, language, skill, history and geography. Most tangibly, the 'Echo Chamber' is the space wherein sound hits and reverberates, where memory and imagination echo across surface, across space, and across time. 
'Leaving the Echo Chamber' does not propose a ""how"" to ""leave"" this context, but rather seeks to put into conversation a series of provocations on how one might re-negotiate the shape, form and function of this chamber, towards a multiplying of the echoes within, such vibration representative of the vast forms of human production -- its rituals, beliefs and customs. The 14th Sharjah Biennial begs the viewer to consider: What does it mean to demand alternate images at a time when news saturation is spoon-fed to us by a monopoly of sources? How do we expand our narratives by acknowledging what has been hidden or removed? Moreover, how can we reflect on our own culturally located histories in an era whereby so many individuals have been forced to believe that they must surrender their own agency to the mainstream forces that exist and govern our world?
The echo chamber here could be construed as a modern day Faraday cage - an enclosure that covers conductive material, which prevents transmitting signals. Except here, artists are given the agency to tell stories that echo in a different way, thus creating new surfaces for a multiplicity of chambers revealing differing means of connecting, surviving and sustaining a collective humanity."
"artfacts","Beirut, Beyrut, Bayrut, Beyrouth, Beyrout","Throughout history, Beirut spelled a variety of ways, and these can still be seen on the city's facades. The different spellings point to the fact that a place has never been just a story or a story, but consists of a myriad voices and interpretations. 
The exhibition Beirut, Beyrut, Bayrut, Beyrouth, Beyrout  explores the socio-political complex society and its history with clarity, seriousness, sadness and humor. The title refers to the cultural diversity that Lebanon and the entire Middle East represents with its long tradition of being a multicultural and multilingual region."
"artfacts","Shaping Light","As part of its Collaboration program, the CAB Foundation is pleased to present Shaping Light, by Albert Baronian, a group exhibition commemorating the Gallery's 45th anniversary. Shaping Light illustrates the different ways in which the artists presented seize neon to give shape to light.
The path proposed by the exhibition is subjective and non-exhaustive. It highlights the different uses of neon in art and confronts historical works with those of contemporary artists who use the material in certain aspects of their practice.
Visual artists sublimate the luminescent tubes, which were originally used as advertising medium and are today an integral part of our daily lives, to highlight their conceptual, linguistic, spatial, abstract or even figurative approaches."
"artfacts","57th Edition - Carnegie International","Schaffner, will open on October 13, 2018. The exhibition will be on view until March 25, 2019. Invited by former museum director Lynn Zelevansky, Schaffner is a curatorial innovator--and Pittsburgh native--known for her intensely researched and widely accessible exhibitions. She is approaching the next International as an encompassing research project, one that looks to artists who inspire an outward look as well as to past Carnegie Internationals."
"artfacts","Mac International 2018","The MAC Belfast is pleased to announce the 13 artists shortlisted for the MAC International 2018: Anca Benera & Arnold Estefan / Ali Cherri / Larissa Fassler / Nikolaus Gansterer / Invernomuto (Simone Bertuzzi & Simone Trabucchi) / Ronan McCrea / Aisling OâBeirn / Vesna Pavlovi? / Renata Poljak / Larissa Sansour / Ãzge TopÃ§u.

Hugh Mulholland, Senior Curator at the MAC, on making the announcement âWe are incredibly excited to reveal the shortlist for the MAC International Prize. It is an exceptionally strong cohort of artists, all of whom are making diverse and challenging work. The artists represented this year individually and collectively contribute to a critical understanding and discourse around an expanded view of contemporary art and the question of artâs context in the world today, and I am confident their work will find a receptive audience in Belfast.â
Anne Barlow said âI am thrilled to be part of the jury for this significant prize for contemporary art. Since its inception in 2014, MAC International has made a vital contribution to the visual arts in Belfast and beyond, offering opportunities for artists from around the world to present both existing and new work to the public. It has been wonderful to see the breadth and quality of applications for this 2018 edition, and I very much look forward to seeing the work of the shortlisted artists at the MAC in November.â

The quality of work submitted this year was outstanding and the process of selecting the artists to take part in the exhibition, alongside my fellow jurors Hugh Mulholland and Anne Barlow, has been a wonderful experience. It has been inspiring to see the quality and criticality demonstrated in the eleven selected projects and I am very excited to see the resulting exhibition in November."
"artfacts","West by Midwest","Art history is often neatly told through the touchstones of individual artists and stylistic movements. West by Midwest tells a messier story of contemporary art--one that illuminates the ways that contemporary art practices spread and develop by tracing the intersecting lives of artists who have migrated from the American Midwest to the West Coast since the mid-20th century. Lured by career opportunities, warmer weather, and the prospect of a better life promised by the postwar boom, those artists who were able to migrate attended art schools together, shared studios, exhibited work in the same galleries, collaborated on projects, engaged in activism, and dated. Following these crisscrossing lines of kinship, West by Midwest reveals a network of artists and their shared experiences of making work and making a life.
Divided into six sections, West by Midwest presents more than 80 artworks in a wide variety of media, made by some 63 artists from the 1960s through the 2010s. Each section maps three overlapping forms of kinship: practice, or the ways that artists make and approach their work; place, or the spaces where artists congregate and exchange ideas; and people, or the manifold human relationships that compose artists' personal and professional circles. This story of contemporary art's spread from the Midwest to the West Coast focuses on formal, material, and historical affinities among these artists, disrupting the mythic solo journey to the western frontier founded on an aspirational ethos of American individualism and independence. Anchored by works in the MCA's collection, West by Midwest eschews a definitive survey of individuals' achievements to instead consider how artists move and make work within a larger field of relations.
West by Midwest is organized by Charlotte Ickes, Andrew W. Mellon Postdoctoral Curatorial Fellow. An extensive microsite accompanies the exhibition. It is presented in the Griffin Galleries of Contemporary Art."
"kadist","ANDRÉ, by Pablo Pijnappel","ANDRÉ, by Pablo Pijnappel
April 11 – May 25, 2008
1945. Joseph takes a boat from Munich to Buenos Aires but decides to stay in Rio. In the slide installation “Felicitas”, we encounter a grey haired woman with a toucan roomed on her shoulder and we follow Maya. She starts dating a Scottish man named Andrew who appears to be Pablo Pijnappel’s stepfather.
Andrew is the main character of this exhibition: after “Felicitas”, he reappears as the only human figure in the 16mm film “Rio” and is finally reduced to a voice in the video entitled “Andrew Reid”.
Intricate, Pablo Pijnappel’s work is first of all very constructed. “Felicitas” offers a complex scenario where text and images can be descriptive, intertwined or completely autonomous. Discrepancy and repetition set the pace. Pablo Pijnappel constructs narratives from anecdotes and daily events, possibly memories, family legends or just pure fictions – but there is no necessity to decide. The non-linear use of different archives and film footage enhances this ambiguity and contributes to loosing track of these stories in time. The works are also composed of pauses and moments of silence, allowing our own imaginations to join in.
Taking advantage of the artist’s presence in Paris for a long period – a one-year residency at la Cité des Arts, Kadist Art Foundation wishes to present Pablo Pijnappel’s work on an on-going basis: a screening of his last photo slide-based work shot in Alaska and a presentation of the work realized during his residency will be organized this year. This exhibition is also an occasion to work with an artist of the collection and to accompany him during a research process.
With the support of FONDS BKVB and Mondriaan Foundation.
Pablo Pijnappel was born in 1979 in Paris he lives and works in Amsterdam. He will be a resident at la Cité Internationale des Arts in Paris for a year starting in April 2008. He is represented by carlier I gebauer in Berlin and Juliètte Jongma in Amsterdam.
Recent solo exhibitions at Künstlerhaus Bremen (Germany), Whitechapel Laboratory (London, UK), Museum De Hallen (Haarlem, The Netherlands).
Recent group exhibitions at the 52nd Venice Biennial (Slovenian pavilion, “Venetian Atmospheric” project by Tobias Putrih), De Appel (Amsterdam, The Netherlands), Artists Space (New York, USA), Witte de With (Rotterdam, The Netherlands).

"kadist","Société Anonyme","Société Anonyme
January 24 – March 16, 2008
The exhibition “Société Anonyme” at Kadist Art Foundation is the continuation of the eponymous show that took place at the contemporary art center Le Plateau in Paris between March 14 and May 13, 2007. This second stage of the project will present a number of works and developments produced by the various artists and protagonists of “Société Anonyme,” following the research and discussions conducted during the first exhibition.
Kadist Art Foundation thus offers to go on and further with the reflection initiated by the curators of “Société Anonyme,” Thomas Boutoux, Natasa Petresin and François Piron, on how to make an exhibition/institution both a pertinent and productive context for the artists to develop new research and works, and a situation that promotes discussion and the inauguration of new communities of interests and aspirations among its audience.
For “Société Anonyme,” part of the exhibition space of the Kadist Art Foundation will be converted into a bookstore: Section 7 Books, a new infrastructure created by Thomas Boutoux and François Piron with artist Oscar Tuazon and art critic Benjamin Thorel, and that was inspired by b_books, the cooperative Berlin bookstore and participant in Société Anonyme’s first phase. Section 7 Books offers a selection of magazines and books rarely visible in the French artistic context, and is an attempt to play an active role in the circulation of knowledge, debates, and writings on art, elaborated here or elsewhere in the world.
At Kadist Art Foundation, the bookstore will serve as a context for the presentation of the works produced by 16 Beaver Group (New York), b_books (Berlin), Chto Delat / What is to be done? (Saint Petersburg), Erick Beltran (Mexico), Nico Dockx & Friends (Antwerp), tranzit (Prague), and What, How & for Whom? (Zagreb), since the “Société Anonyme” exhibition at Le Plateau. It will also host a series of events and projects by artists and producers of the French art scene (such as Editions Mix, or the new art journal Rosa B.) on the ideas and practices that constitute the backbone of “Société Anonyme:” hospitality, new institutionalism, self-organization, intellectual sociality, the economics of art today, the culture of enthusiasm, the modalities for circulating and sharing ideas and information, political consciousness…
In this space as well, a series of dinners will be organized every Sunday night. Each dinner will be dedicated to a guest and a specific subject: cinema and politics, with Dmitry Vilenski from What is To Be Done?; the organization of discourse, with Erick Beltran; collaborative practices, with François Bucher from 16 Beaver group; how to rethink a contemporary art institution today, be it a public institution, with Emily Pethick, director of Casco Office for Art, Design and Theory, in Utrecht ; or a private one, with Zhang Wei and Hu Fang, directors of Vitamin Creative Space, Shanghai/Beijing.
A series of booklets documenting these collective conversations will be published on-site.
This program of events at Kadist Art Foundation will thus make “Société Anonyme,” once again, a situation of continuous activity and exchange.
“Société Anonyme” is a project realized with the support of American Center Foundation, and in collaboration with Le Plateau/Frac Ile-de-France, Paris.

"kadist","This is Utopia, to Some","With Steffani Jemison & Justin Hicks, Isaac Kariuki & Tamar Clarke-Brown, Chloé Quenum, Martine Syms
Co-curated with Elise Atangana
Opening reception on Saturday, March 10, 2018, from 5 to 8 pm
Performance by Isaac Kariuki & Tamar Clarke-Brown at 5.30 and 7:30 pm
 
 
The exhibition This is Utopia, to Some1 conceived in collaboration with curator Elise Atangana, rearticulates visual narratives revealing a multiplicity of subjectivities and hybrid identities that coexist and interact. The distinction between what is legitimated by the museum display and “ the culture of everyday life, which was thus de-valued as the denigrated product of mass-culture or as the de-valorised folk-culture of the urban masses”2, in other words, the distinction between high and low culture – has been rendered obsolete. Instead, the definition of art should include the practices of artists who create their own editorial platforms, generate autonomous models outside the art world, as tools of visibility. They intervene at the intersection of private language and public communication and modify the relations between artist and audience. New rituals of re-appropriation, translation, and sharing of personal and collective experiences fuel the circulation of images, maintaining links between the past, present and future. By referring to specific sources as a form of resistance, transposed, translated into different fields (from graphic design and fashion, to music and literature) the participants of this exhibition generate formal languages that stimulate political imagination.
Cultural inheritance generates specific knowledge and implies ownership. It is not public, it is privately owned. The question of sources and of the responsibility toward histories requires special care during translation. Chloé Quenum’s series of Allegories appears as a formal abstraction. This series comes from her research in West Africa (Benin and Togo) on notions of origin and transmission through fabrics. The systems and graphic compositions on wax fabrics have specific meanings. The artist transposed these representations onto cathedral glass. Light reflection and glass vibration displace the reading of these patterns from their original context.
This echoes Steffani Jemison’s way of looking at how an experience can be at once aesthetic, ecstatic and intellectual.
Power listening (Power power power power) results from a collaboration between Steffani Jemison and Justin Hicks with the inhabitants of a housing project in Brooklyn during Summer 2017. During the workshops, a listening session led to a collective transcript of an audio piece onto paper. From that experiment, Steffani Jemison produced a large drawing on velvet entitled Power listening (How would we ever get over / over), to explore the correlation between drawing and writing.
Cbt (coding : braiding : transmission) is a collaborative performance and video installation conceived by Isaac Kariuki with artist and writer Tamar Clarke-Brown, in which braiding textures and gestures are translated into coding language. Using GoPro cameras and movement detection software, Isaac Kariuki echoes contemporary forms of policing that use technology to identify individuals. “Surveillance is nothing new for black folks”3 . This work is to consider in relation to the recognition of Black bodies in the Western public space, whilst hair braiding is part of a historical and cultural tradition that has spread throughout the African Diaspora.
Martine Syms’ practice explores how, in our highly mediated digital age, the production of images is linked to the production of identity. In 2012 she conceived the editorial platform Dominica Publishing, an imprint that is “dedicated to exploring blackness as a topic, reference, and marker, and audience in visual culture. SHE MAD: Laughing Gas, Syms’ 2016 video installation, couples the form of the sitcom with omnipresent social media and phone screens as our quotidian backdrops. Syms’s Laughing Gas uses Edwin Porter’s 1907 silent film of the same title as a starting point for constructing a history of representation that extends into the present. Starring African American actress Bertha Regustus, the original film is, “an early example of black women having a kind of subjectivity,” says Martine Syms.
This is Utopia, to Some underlines the complexity of identities while showing their continuity. In that sense, the projection of a hypothetical future by the artists could be presented as mutiple vernacular practices, which explore their own histories, modes of existence and re-appropriation, to counterbalance the representations framing our everyday life.

"kadist","General Rehearsal (Moscow)","“General Rehearsal” is a multidisciplinary project conceived and realised in collaboration between V-A-C Foundation, KADIST, and the Moscow Museum of Modern Art.
The exhibition will combine a selection of works from these three international art collections and feature over one hundred artists. Designed to evolve and change like a living organism that adapts and responds to its environment, “General Rehearsal” adopts the structure of a theatrical play, developing over three acts staged over a five-month period. In this framework, the project proposes considering artworks as actors in the play, having a potential agency similar to human beings.
The Belgian artist Koenraad Dedobbeleer, well-known for expanding our perspective of objects and their appearance with his installation and sculpture, has been commissioned to design displays, walls, plinths, seating and other forms that will guide the visitor.
A wide-ranging public programme for all ages within the framework of “General Rehearsal” will include tours, talks, reading groups, screenings, an art mediation department and a live music/performance/theatre programme. Highlights include Romanian artist Alexandra Pirici’s sculptural performance entitled “Parthenon Marbles” (KADIST collection), featuring local actors and dancers, which questions the role of the arts in contemporary economies.
“General Rehearsal” will include work by artists such as Pio Abad, Dennis Adams, Victor Alimpiev, Jennifer Allora & Guillermo Calzadilla, Francis Alÿs, Eleanor Antin, Ei Arakawa & Sergei Tcherepnin, Tauba Auerbach, Yto Barrada, Christiane Baumgartner, Erick Beltrán, Barbara Bloom, Alighiero Boetti, Pauline Boudry / Renate Lorenz, Alexander Brodsky, Marcel Broodthaers, Kennedy Browne, Matthew Buckingham, CAMP, Marc Camille Chaimowicz, Etienne Chambaud, Ali Cherri, Yin-Ju Chen, Phil Collins, Bernadette Corporation, Abraham Cruzvillegas, Matthew Darbyshire, Michael Dean, Mariana Castillo Deball, Willie Doherty, Köken Ergun, Harun Farocki, Ceal Floyer, Günther Förg, Peter Friedl, Chiara Fumai, Alexandra Galkina, Ryan Gander, Dora Garcia, Fabien Giraud & Raphael Siboni, Lola Gonzàles, Douglas Gordon, Andrew Grassie, Yu Honglei, Julius Koller, Jeff Koons, Mark Leckey, Pierre Leguillon, Jill Magid, David Maljkovic, Piero Manzoni, Allan McCollum, Lucy McKenzie, John Menick, Andrei Monastyrski & Collective Actions, Vladislav Mamyshev-Monroe, Amedeo Modigliani, Charlotte Moth, Melvin Moti, Jean-Luc Moulène, Ciprian Muresan, Shahryar Nashat, Otobong Nkanga, Ho Tzu Nyen, Boris Orlov,  Damián Ortega, Anatoly Osmolovsky, Alexandra Paperno, Philippe Parreno, Giuseppe Penone, Sigmar Polke, Pratchaya Phinthong, Dmitri Alexandrovitch Prigov, Walid Raad / ATLAS GROUP, Clément Rodzlieski, Cameron Rowland, Evariste Richer, Gerhard Richter, Wael Shawky, Yinka Shonibare, Simon Starling, Mladen Stilinovic, Hiroshi Sugimoto, Wolfgang Tillmans, Mikhail Tolmachev, Mario García Torres, Oscar Tuazon, Danh Vo, Kelley Walker, Jessica Warboys, Apichatpong Weerasethakul, Raphaël Zarka, and Arseny Zhilyaev.

Often played by children and teenagers, the protagonists on view in On Struggling to Remain Present When You Want to Disappear take active part in physical or symbolic conflicts as they create alternative personalities, forge online relationships, or navigate across constructed environments. Through immersive video and sound installations as well as photographs, the exhibition examines the boundaries where the tangible, the imagined, and the virtual become permeable, and the porousness of these frontiers allows players to break out of traditional societal norms to explore new ways of dealing with their own realities.
Culminating the curatorial fellowship of Wang Dan at KADIST San Francisco, the exhibition is a collaboration between OCAT (Shanghai), the Central Academy of Fine Arts (Beijing), and KADIST.
*On Struggling To Remain Present When You Want To Disappear draws from the title of an essay On Being Present Where You Wish to Disappear, by Nana Adusei-Poku, published in e-flux journal #80 – March 2017

Beyond the End is an exhibition dedicated to a research and residency program initiated in 2010 in Tierra del Fuego by curator Camila Marambio. Over the years, the Ensayos residencies have given shape to a dialogue between artists, scientists, local inhabitants and Karukinka Natural Park. Based on the premise that only creative collaboration can efface frontiers in the field of biocultural conservation, Ensayos enacts the complex interdependence of humans, non-humans and matter with the urgency of maturing aesthetic sensibility in the face of scientific discoveries. The work in the exhibition attempts to give form to this multidisciplinary, multispecies research-based project.
From Tierra del Fuego…
After observing and interacting with the methods used by a group of conservation biologists working in Karukinka1 Natural Park in Tierra del Fuego (Chilean Patagonia), Camila Marambio, an independent curator, was stirred to question the uselesness of art. That is why, in 2010, she convinced Dr. Bárbara Saavedra, the ecologist who directs the park, to include artists as researchers. Together they organized a meeting that took place in February 2011, during which eighteen people (artists, scientists, local islanders and park rangers) met in Tierra del Fuego to speculate on some of the pressing conservation issues with the intention of unveiling the potential of transdisciplinary research.
This first inquiry residency trip to Karukinka was called ‘‘Ensayo #1’’, and later gave the whole initiative its name, ENSAYOS (Essays if we translate into English), due to the pragmatic trial-and-error approach which offers the possibility of rehearsing other ethics and worldings in search of novel ways to steward the environment.
With this desire in mind, ‘‘Essayo #1’’ drafted some issues to be addressed by three different groups of researchers. These are: the handling of the castor canadensis (the beaver is considered an invasive species by the scientific community in Tierra del Fuego), the governance of the archipelago’s coastal areas, and the Island’s social history.
…To the exhibition at Kadist (Paris)
Given that the “beaver problem” is considered to be the biggest threat to the conservation of biodiversity in Tierra del Fuego, Ensayo #2 picked up on this issue. From a dialogue between artist Christy Gast, Bárbara Saavedra, Camila Marambio, anthropologists Laura Ogden and Melissa Memory, and biologists Derek Córcoran and Giorgia Graells, an initial inquiry arose: how could they, as a research group, include the beaver in the decision making process about its own future on the island? This led them to rehearse various ways of listening to the beavers on the island, and to hear the call of other non-humans that demand fair attention. The beaver issue, represented in the first part of the exhibition Beyond the End at the Kadist Foundation in Paris, has broadened the scope of aesthetic viewpoints: in this dialogue between species and between disciplines there is an unexplored potential for action and reflection leading towards a practice of rhizomatic imagination that dissolves even the notion of species.
Tierra del Fuego in the city of enlightenment
Beyond the End, at Kadist Paris, gives researchers and artists the opportunity to gather for a one-week work session to discuss the matters that will concern ‘‘Ensayo #3’’. Articulated as a series of attempts to reach beyond questions about the subject and its identity, ways of knowing and how we know, humanity as the only form of culture, the work-week will aim at new types of questions: What is beyond us? What is non-human (within and around us)? or What is human from the perspective of the other? To inaugurate an inquiry into a post-human geography of Tierra del Fuego.
This work-week will take place after the opening (from June 1st to Saturday 7th), and include a series of presentations, screenings, performances and public actions, presented at Kadist, Musée de la Chasse et la Nature, Ciné 13 and Museum National d’Histoire Naturelle.
Más Alla del Fin, the inaugural edition of Ensayos’ newspaper, will be released on the occasion of the exhibition. Editor, Art Historian Carla Macchiavello, invited Chilean researchers to contribute hyper-local, first person accounts of their encounters and impressions of Tierra del Fuego.

Notes
1- Karukinka means Tierra del Fuego (Land of Fire) in the Selk’nam language.
2- In 1889, to celebrate one hundred years of “Freedom, equality, brotherhood”, Paris hosted a Universal Exhibition that had amongst its “attractions” a gleaming Eiffel Tower and a “Human Zoo”, where nine Selk’nam from the Tierra del Fuego Island were on show amongst four hundred other indigenous people.

"kadist","PACIFIC LIMN","YOUNG-HAE CHANG HEAVY INDUSTRIES (YHCHI) presents Pacific Limn (2013)
– WHY AM I AFRAID OF THE U.S.A.?
– I TRIED TO DISCUSS COMMUNISM WITH THE CHINESE 
  BUT NO ONE WANTED TO TALK TO ME
– THE SECRET LIFE OF HARUMI
Produced during their two month residency in San Francisco, Young-Hae Chang Heavy Industries present Pacific Limn, a three-part narrative, mixing thier signature rhythmic approach with the cultural climax of San Francisco. According to the artists, the word “Limn” calls upon both its literal meaning to “depict or describe in painting or words,” but also self-consciously substitutes the word Rim, pointing to the slippage between “L” and “R” in some Asian languages. Alternating between a seductive and acerbic use of language, Pacific Limn combines erotic fantasy with sardonic wit. The project continues YHCHI’s exploration of “digital literature”, a combination of up-tempo music, the Monaco typeface, and Adobe Flash text animation. Superimposed over static or moving images, the texts appear at a pace just within the threshold of cognition. In this way, YHCHI creates an immersive experience that fluctuates between reading and watching.

"kadist","Archaeology of Longing (Archéologie de la Chine)","Archaeology of Longing (Archéologie de la Chine)
September 20 – November 9, 2008
Curator: Sofía Hernández Chong Cuy, in residence at Kadist Art Foundation, Paris.
With a title drawn from a short story by Susan Sontag, “Archaeology of Longing (Archéologie de la Chine)” is an exhibition bringing together a number of artworks, artifacts, and common objects. It begins as an investigation into  disenchantment, soon digressing through the historical flatlands of interpretation and substitution. Far from melancholic, and closer to what can be described as politically intimate, the exhibition is an inventory of that journey.
Archaeology of Longing includes artwork by Alejandro Cesarco, Luca Frei, Emma Hedditch, Bethan Huws, Fabio Kacero, Rober Racine, Kay Rosen, Katerina Šedá, Joe Scanlan and Lisa Tan; artifacts and objects on loan by several contributors, including Tania Bruguera and Archives Erik Satie; and exhibition furniture designed by Tomás Alonso.
A collection of findings uncovered during the archaeology of longing is also available as a publication titled “84 handkerchiefs, an umbrella and some books”.

"kadist","Like an Attali report, but different","Like an Attali report, but different
June 15 – July 27, 2008
Curator: Cosmin Costinas
With: Yael Bartana, Gregg Bordowitz, Heman Chong, Ciprian Muresan, Deimantas Narkevicius, Redza Piyadasa, Pushwagner, Anatoli Osmolovsky, Mona Vatamanu & Florin Tudor
The Attali Report (or the Report of the Commission for the Liberation of French Growth), commissioned by President Sarkozy, was published half a year ago, provoking a long series of discussions, mainly confined to the French public arena and mainly focused on the report’s concrete proposals, set to implement a neoliberal model for the French economy and society. But the Attali Report is a surprisingly interesting text, especially in its emphatic high brow literary introduction, being one of the first major instances where the neoliberal system is asserted beyond the rather discreet discourse of the “necessary reforms” through which it has insinuated itself since the eighties. It is now invested with the value of a concrete historical paradigm, of a describable era of revolutionary novelty, making the Attali Report a relevant document for the current attempts to imagine a dominant narrative representing and organizing the scope of our global system.
However, this exhibition is neither about the Attali Report nor is it a report itself. It does, nonetheless, try to unfold fictions and images that offer an insight on different narratives that have been overlapping for the past decades in our thinking of politics, at different times and in different localities. It refers to the disintegration of the communist utopia and some images, passions, stories and reactions that came along with this process; it visits the meeting of fiction and Utopian thinking on both sides of the Iron Curtain; it mentions some processes of exoticization and nation building; it acknowledges the formation of communities of struggle and resistance.
But the works don’t passively present such narratives, they alter them and participate – albeit indirectly – to their fabrication. The exhibition works at this point of interaction between story telling and political imagination, a knot that encapsulates the political potential of art as an agent of representation. It brings together these occurrences and positions, sometimes contradictory, sometimes doubtful and sometimes passionately engaged and determined.
The reference to the Attali report on the state of France, a highly specific and local anchor, is used to take the discussion into a wider perspective, to mark the moments and the blockages – as well as some parallel areas of articulation – that have contributed to the current crisis in the imagination of a language and a scope for politics.
The exhibition is accompanied by interventions of writers and critics and by a film program that reiterates a few lines of the exhibition, using the cinematic language and its potentials.
The exhibition is generously supported by Plan B, Cluj; OCA – Office for Contemporary Art Norway, Oslo; Royal Danish Embassy in Paris; Lithuanian Institute, Vilnius.

"kadist","The Secession Sessions","A collaboration with BAM/PFA for MATRIX 257, The Secession Sessions is an exhibition and series of related public programs exploring a place caught in a contested narrative–the disputed region of Abkhazia, located along the eastern shores of the Black Sea. Consisting of a new film, Letters to Max (2014); a pseudo, unofficial embassy (“Anembassy”) for Abkhazia staffed by the former foreign minister of Abkhazia, Maxim Gvinjia (also the star of the film); and a program of conversations and public events, The Secession Sessions invites visitors to investigate the question of statehood and representation through the prism of the stateless state of Abkhazia. Baudelaire establishes an open space for discourse and contemplation, while acknowledging both sides of the politically fraught situation.
Max was available via skype at the Anembassy on Saturday February 14th and 21st from 1 to 3pm. Visitors were  invited to leave questions for Max at the Anembassy, or to send questions via Kadist’s Facebook or Twitter.
The film Letters to Max will screen Wednesdays through Fridays at 3 and 4:45pm, and Saturdays at 3pm.
Session 1: The Anembassy is Open
February 7 at 5pm
A conversation between Karen Fiss, Maxim Gvinjia, and Eric Baudelaire

“Abkhazia seceded from Georgia, in the Caucasus, during a civil war in 1992-1993. Like all disputed lands, Abkhazia is entangled in a conflicted narrative. To many Georgians, the breakaway State is a rogue nationalist regime, an amputated part of Georgia. To the Abkhaz, independence saved them from cultural extinction after years of Stalinist repression and Georgian domination. To many observers, Abkhazia is simply a pawn in the Great Game Russia and the West have always played in the Caucasus. “The Secession Sessions” acknowledges these competing narratives and does not seek to write an impossible objective historiography. It does not parse, verify or document any competing claims to a land. The project starts with this observation: Abkhazia has had a territorial and human existence for twenty years, and yet it will in all likelihood remain in limbo for the foreseeable future, which makes the self-construction of its narrative something worth exploring. If Abkhazia is a laboratory case for the birth of a nation, then its Garibaldis and George Washingtons are still alive and active. Maxim Gvinjia is one of them. When I dropped an envelope in a mailbox in Paris a year ago, I fully expected that a letter addressed to “Maxim Gvinjia, former Minister of Foreign Affairs, Sukhum, Republic of Abkhazia,” would come straight back to my studio with the notice “destination unknown.” But to my surprise, ten weeks later, I got an email from Max telling me he had received my letter, but could not reply on paper since the post office in Abkhazia cannot handle international mail. I have no idea how or why my letter arrived.”
–Eric Baudelaire
The exhibition is preceded by two film screenings at the PFA Theater on February 4 and 5. In The Anabasis of May and Fusako Shigenobu, Masao Adachi and 27 Years Without Images (2011) and its sequel, The Ugly One (2013), Baudelaire complicates the distinctions between documentary and narrative genres to reflect on the real and imagined memories of the protagonists, whose lives become dislocated in time and place. The Anabasis examines the intertwined stories of Japanese New Wave filmmaker Masao Adachi, who joined the Japanese Red Army in Beirut in 1974, and May Shigenobu, daughter of the leader of the same left-wing revolutionary faction. For The Ugly One, also set in Beirut, Baudelaire collaborated with Adachi on the storyline, which pivots around two lovers and former resistance fighters who attempt to remember and make sense of their pasts.
