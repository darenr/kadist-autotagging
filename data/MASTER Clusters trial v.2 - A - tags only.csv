Du Zhenjun,The Tower of Babel: Independence of the country," The Tower of Babel is an installation of large-format photographs that forces the audience to occupy a central position through its monumental scale. These photographs present a series of urban landscapes and assembled Foucauldian structures of the present. Du sees the Tower of Babel as a continually reinvented narrative that warns people of “dangerous tendencies in the present time.” Du’s Babylonian towers resurrect from fallen rubbles of religious history in grand scale to focus on modern crises of civilization. Though the theme began with the struggle of monotheism over linguistic and geographic diversity in early human history, Babel in Du’s work has become a contemporary vision of catastrophic threat to the future of humanity.

Jiang Pengyi,Unregistered City series #1 #2 #7,"  Unregistered City  is a series of eight photographs depicting different scenes of a vacant, apparently post-apocalyptic city: Some are covered by dust and others are submerged by water. Yet, ambiguous lights blink from buildings and yachts still sail on the water, and further observation reveals these structures to be miniatures manipulated by the artist through Photoshop and other postproduction image tools. The model city’s surroundings are themselves real abandoned spaces, perhaps an empty room, a wait-to-be demolished building, or a discarded bathtub. In this way,  Unregistered City  is a double play on a dystopia vision of urbanization: It is an imagined city built upon the actual ruins of cities and human life. Through a dark and entropic undertone and estranged urban arrangements, the artist does not just critique, but poses fundamental questions.

Eleanor Antin,100 Boots,"Comprised of fifty-one photographic postcards, Antin’s  100 Boots  is an epic visual narrative in which 100 black rubber boots stand in for a fictional “hero” making a “trip” from California to New York City. Over two-and-a-half years, Antin photographed the boots against different backdrops across the U.S., and then turned the pictures into postcards, which she then mailed to approximately 1,000 people around the world. In conjunction with the boots’ “arrival” in New York City, the postcards were exhibited at the Museum of Modern Art. The project speaks not only to the reproduction and dissemination of images, but also about how the material reality of the images—their settings and their existence in mailboxes—was in stark contrast to the everyday lives of the people who received the cards. As with all “mail art” which had begun with the Fluxus movement in the late 1950s and was on the rise in the late 1960s, using the postal service enabled artists to completely bypass the traditional art-world distribution system, and allowed Antin to expand or compress time as the narrative required.

Mathilde Rosier,Far from Honolulu," Rosier’s body of films, gleam with that indeterminate in-between glow of twilight. Things hardly move at all in her films. They are, quite simply, often without plot, without spoken voice and without narrative elements. Such is the case of  Far from Honolulu  (2003), a film exploring the plight of intuition and emotion inside the idea of the sea journey. In the film, a pensive and reflective man is depicted playing guitar at sea as well as from inside a boat looking outward. Airy and divine-like, he is shown sleeping, in a trance state, staring out to the ocean, waiting for the journey to pass, progress, in order to arrive somewhere, but where? There is mention of Recife, Brazil, but one gets the sense that figure and place is almost other-worldly or mythic. This is further highlighted by the repetitious sound of the ocean’s waves. The ending of the film is quite arbitrary, expressing a clear desire to not illustrate an end or a narrative, but another kind of vacant agency close to immediacy and the present.

Brenna Youngblood,Red Door," Brenna Youngblood’s chromogenic print  Red Door  (2007) is representative of the artist’s interest in conceptual photography; she also works in multimedia collage and assemblage, drawing imagery from the everyday and giving new meanings to seemingly mundane objects and places. The image of a red door inspires a tension between potential meaning and purposeful ambiguity, leaving the viewer to wonder about her formal decisions. The color red on a door is often used to symbolize good luck, and in almost every culture, means welcome. Some say a red door was a sign of a safe house on the Underground Railroad.

Dominique Zinkpè,Cosmos animiste," Dominique Zinkpès works with a wide range of materials, from jute to used cars to “hôhô” figures, which come from the Cult of Twins in southern Benin as a voodoo religion symbole of fertility. His portfolio is continually morphing between mediums and subjects, tackling issues such as intimacy, sex, the sacred and the profane while linking ancestral culture with the contradictions found in today’s world. These sketches of tumultuous human drama are infused with elements of irony and satire to reveal Zinkpè’s most disturbing and arresting constructs of the imagination. In  Cosmos Animiste , Dominique Zinkpé presents a world of ghosts. They show the transformation that people, animals and vegetation undergo, through contact with their environment – an animistic idea. Borrowing from dreams and the world of the spirits, the quasi-human characters in this painting hover above a modern city, and seem agitated in a battle involving desire and metamorphosis. The strange, hybrid beings — both man and animal — engage in scenes of dance, evoking the transcendental power play deeply rooted in Benin culture vis-à-vis games of masquerade, sex and gender. Energetic in its lively colors but at the same time through fragile drawing, reminiscent of graffiti (a big inspiration for Dominique Zinkpé), this painting reminds one of hastily scribbled notes. This little scenery could disappear at once, as it was an epiphany. Drawing from the aesthetic currents and beliefs of the past, this painting underscores unresolved tensions that have arisen from the fusion of Catholicism, animism, and indigenous traditions, with contemporary culture.

Hans Peter Feldmann,Teapot with shadow," The types of objects Feldmann is interested in collecting into serial photographic grids or artists books are often also found in three dimensional installations. Against authorship and the commodification of art, he never gives titles or dates to his works which have infinite edition possibilities. This mise en scène of found kitchenware also exists with a rounder and flatter plain modern white porcelain teapot.  
The mode of display is paired down to the simplest form of a plain square plinth that nevertheless conveys artistry, as does the addition of the cut piece of cardboard signifying a shadow. This recalls his large scale actual Shadow Play for the Venice Biennale in 2009. Feldmann has described his memories of working as a waiter and the lasting impression of the chairs propped up on the tables at the end of day and left the art world in the 1980s to work in a gift store with his wife. work, like hat with photoand pair of shoes also in the collection, is loaded with art historical references and irreverence through a simple assembly of an object and a classic artistic trick.

Walead Beshty,"Black Curl (CMY/Five Magnet: Irvine, California, March 25, 2010, Fujicolor Cyrstal Archive Super Type C, EM No 165-021, 05910)","  Black Curl (CMY/Five Magnet: Irvine, California, March 25, 2010, Fujicolor Cyrstal Archive Super Type C, EM No 165-021, 05910)  is a visually compelling photogram. Bold shapes, and the breaks between them, create a rhythm and compose an engaging abstract image. At the same time, the work deals with the conditions of the photograph’s manufacture. The literal production of a photograph—the process of photo developing and printing—is the work’s subject, and Beshty slyly points to the ways in which these material processes possess their own aesthetic appeal and content.

Miri Segal,"BRB (""be right back"")"," The work  BRB  is a 30 min. journey in the new game world of Second Life (“SL”). Consistent with Segal’s work with the projected image, this video was shot using a virtual in-world camera, with the footage later being transformed by a software custom designed by the artist. The video explores the idea of masks we wear in SL and real life (“RL”), and the differences in communication within those two worlds. When somebody speaks, his or her avatar is seen typing, a mechanical ticking sound is heard, and words appear as text on the screen, strengthening the feeling that the conversation is taking place inside of our head. The video creates a new relation to the body and a new form of intimacy. We seem to engage this new form by chance, using the games search engine Segal’s avatar sometimes appears with a Google search page as a mask, perhaps as a salute to another icon of cyber culture. With  BRB , roaming in SL is like wandering inside our collective sub-conscious.

Diana Thater,Perpetual Motion Two," In  Perpetual Motion  (2005) the seemingly erratic flight of the bright orange Monarch butterfly—filmed in its winter habitat of Michoacán, Mexico—is intensified by the artist’s editing in which frames are randomly dropped and the film is sped up. As a result, the butterflies become hyper-real and animated in appearance. The manipulated footage is presented in a video wall of nine monitors, where the butterflies flit from screen to screen, in a room bathed in vivid orange light.

Charles Avery,"Untitled (Waiters dancing with Itinerants, Onomatopoeia)"," Since 2005, Charles Avery has devoted his practice to the perpetual description of a fictional island. Replete with its own population and constantly shifting topography, Avery’s intricately conceived project amounts to an ever-expanding body of drawings, sculptures, installations and texts which evince the island. Exhibited incrementally these heterogeneous elements serve as terms within the unifying structure of the island – as multiple emissions of an imaginary state, and as a meditation on the central themes of philosophy and the problems of art-making. The ultimate destination of Avery’s epic venture is the documentation of this ‘heterotopia’ in a book of many volumes. Avery is one of a number of artists who have promoted a return to narrative. The Kadist Foundation Collection also owns a fictive map by Avery. 
 This drawing is a medium-sized work in which Avery depicts an event taking place on the island close to the Labour Exchange down by the port. In essence he depicts a dance-off between waiters and itinerant workers who are looking for work on the island. The idea comes from his own experience as a 16 year-old in Italy where he met a Spaniard who had danced his way from Spain to Italy, earning money in the street by doing so. Avery teamed up with him and became the hat carrier, money collector. Avery sees this kind of drawing as a companion to the large architectural views that show the principal buildings on the island and distant views of people. It is as though he is zooming in on a particular incident caught at the edge of a camera lens. The island is of course fictional but it is nevertheless a credible place, a little like Second Life, where characters act out their lives. In fact people are beginning to use the scenarios in their teaching work as though they were real and exemplary of certain true life situations. If there is a fantastical element at all it is redolent of  Jabberwocky , Lewis Carroll’s celebrated poem, which has been an important text for Avery. Avery is creating a world which could well be a place on this planet, an island off the coast of his native Scotland, for example, which can be visited by tourists (essentially the role of the viewer) or by those who want to stay there indefinitely (the role of the characters in the drawings).

Daniel Keller,Soft Staycation (Gaze Track Edit)," To make the video installation  Soft Staycation (Gaze Track Edit) , the artist, playing the role of ‘job creator’, hired a group of unemployed and expat freelancers through Craigslist to watch a 30 minute compilation of national tourism ads. These ads, which are generally sponsored by various publicly funded tourism boards and screened in airports for example, were found on the Internet by Keller. He used a gaze-tracking camera to measure the eye movements of the people participating in the experiment. Despite the relentlessness of the source, the subjects define zones of attention that the camera records. 
 Instead of using the gathered gaze data for any specific research purpose, the consumptive gaze is transmuted onto the video itself, creating an ensemble of light spots and shadows. The film is screened on a large LED screen, the same kind used for advertisement purposes. By staging a typical marketing study, the artist points out the persisting automatisms of consumer-spectators, while the flexible LED curtain makes it quite a sculptural and hypnotic piece.

Michal Chelbin,Strangely familiar: Angelina with her father," Michal Chelbin’s staged yet intimate portrait photographs, seduce the viewer into uncomfortable, voyeuristic complicity with the camera. Several works represent adolescent girls on the verge of sexual consciousness, their bodies still that of a child while their gaze directly confronts the viewer implying differently. Michal Chelbin shoots in a format of utter stability-the square. She positions her subjects well within the frame where visual clarity prevails. Angelina and her father, Israel belongs to the “Strangely Familiar” series where she shifted form shooting in the studio to the outside world, from theatrical to found light. In this work, an athletic but vulnerable-looking man holds his daughter in front of a swamp, poised as if offering her to the viewer.  
Though the photographs remain staged and her efforts directorial, Chelbin has sublimated the work’s mythic aspects by exploring a world of characters that lend themselves readily to the romantic-the world of athletes, ballroom dancers, and performers in small traveling shows and circuses, mostly in Eastern Europe, but also in Israel and England. With little supporting information to go on, we reflexively fill in the blanks and ride the images’ narrative momentum wherever it leads. Much of the time taking us to places steeped in discontinuity, incongruity, ambiguity. Places of subtle, underlying tension between the odd and the ordinary.

Guy Ben-Ner,Wild Boy,"  Wild Boy   is the story of the education of Amir, the artists son. Ben-Ner plays the educators part, trying to domesticate the child. Using the metaphor of the wild child is Ben-Ners homage to this recurring theme in literature and cinema: from Edgar Rice Burroughs « Tarzan » to Truffauts « Lenfant sauvage », and Rudyard Kiplings « Jungle book ». The video is an attempt at capturing this decisive moment when the child lets go of its wilderness to become « civilized », and raises the nature/culture dichotomy, dear to the Enlightenment philosophers.

Pierre Leguillon,"Diane Arbus: A printed retrospective, 1960-1971"," End of 2008, Pierre Leguillon presented at Kadist Art Foundation the first retrospective of the works of Diane Arbus (1923-1971) organized in France since 1980, bringing together all the images commissioned to the New York photographer by the Anglo-American press in the 1960s. This exhibition, destined to tour in various locations, presents the original pages of the magazines, including Harpers Bazaar, Esquire, Nova and The Sunday Times Magazine. As Pierre Leguillon states on the exhbitions publication: The mythology surrounding Diane Arbus character is willingly set aside to offer a more neutral point of view on a more unfamiliar part of her work, although it was mass-distributed. Many of the characters portrayed in these commissioned works seem less sensational at first glance than the freaks that made Diane Arbus work so famous, since the retrospective MOMA organized in 1973 in New York, two years after her suicide. And yet, leafing through all her contributions for the press, the Diane Arbus method, her installing the model in an environment in such a particular way, emerges obviously. Long sitting sessions, sometimes repeated, were destined to allow the model to « let go », while he never stopped fixing the camera, straight forward. It is no doubt their rigorous construction that enables these images, still today, to be contemporary.

James Weeks,Man with Blue Tie," Both Head-Portrait with Red and Blue Background and Man with Blue Tie are classic examples of Weeks deftness of line, shape, and color. These two works illustrate his signature flattened style -a vast departure from figurative painting of the time- and hints of influence from modernist painters like Henri Matisse and Maynard Dixon, although with a somewhat darker tone. Both figures stare with with expressionless faces and hollow eyes. Weeks provides us with little visual information to distinguish the identities of these men. Are politicians, members of the jazz club scene that Weeks often depicted, or simply acquaintances that agreed to sit for him? Head-Portrait with Red and Blue Background and Man with Blue Tie are interesting examples of the Bay Area figurative painting movement in their contrast to the sunny landscapes of Elmer Bischoff and the abstract or non-objective works of Richard Diebenkorn.

Robert Zhao Renhui,Expedition #46,"  Expedition #46  is a work from the series The Glacier Study Group, which consists of artists, scientists, activists, and enthusiasts of glacial and polar activity in the Artic Circle to conduct scientific investigation, data collection, and glacier sampling. Recent media attention on global warming and climate change has driven interest in increased glacial activity. The group spends long period of each year in the harsh Arctic environment to acquire in-depth knowledge of these changes while experiencing the landscape firsthand.  Expedition #46  presents voyeuristic images of human activity in expansive surreal glacial landscapes to elicit a sense of discovery in the viewer, who travels by-proxy via Zhao’s photographic series. The viewer is able to observe the Study Group’s journey in observing their environment and engage in critical reflection of the varying documentary spectatorship deployed in the visual discourse of environmentalism and scientific research.

Fernanda Gomes,Untitled," For this floor based work, Gomes has taken two lengths of bamboo and tied them together using linen thread. The work is self-supporting and stands in a crack or a hole in the floor. The work suggests precariousness, frailty as well as humanity through its verticality, and its gentle sinuous form, referencing perhaps the work of Giacometti. Other works in the exhibition recalled the work of Mondrian with an emphasis on horizontal and vertical lines. The fact that this work deviates from an emphasis on the rectilinear should be seen within the context of Gomes’s constructivist routes and her interest in Arte Povera. Allowing the material to express its own inner nature is fundamental to her work. The modest nature of her art suggests a poetics of the immaterial. The standing sculpture, modest though it may be, articulates the space of the room, suggesting a near and a far. Gomes generally makes her work in situ, responding to the space the exhibition will occupy, the gallery thus becoming an extension of her studio.
