Abdul Abdullah,"This large portrait of a man, caught as though in mid-conversation, is titled Caliban, after a central character in Shakespeare’s play The Tempest. Caliban is a half-human ‘mooncalf’, son of the witch Sycorax and the sole inhabitant of the island on which he was born until a storm shipwrecks father and daughter, Prospero and Miranda, there. Caliban functions in the play as a ridiculed and disempowered outsider – the ‘other’ to Prospero’s Eurocentric assumption of authority. By dint of its title, Abdul Abdullah’s portrait positions its subject as the marginalised and oppressed figure in an unequal power relation. Abdullah, a seventh-generation Australian of Muslim background, identified with the oppressed Caliban while in high school. He has referenced the character in a number of his works, referring to himself and his brothers in one self-portrait as Sons of Sycorax. Abdullah was 14 when the September 11 terrorist attacks occurred. He came of age at a time of hostility and suspicion towards Muslims in Australia, when, as he has noted, “you couldn’t open a newspaper, turn on the television or listen to the radio without being reminded you were the bad guy and that you were frankly unwelcome. The war on terror felt like a war on you.” The politicisation of his identity as the ‘bad guy’ has led Abdullah to create works – mostly portraits and self-portraits – critiquing Islamophobic depictions of Muslim youth in Australia. His work has challenged viewers’ expectations and assumptions through confronting images of masked people – some in Muslim clothing wearing chimpanzee masks, others in racially vilifying t-shirts and balaclavas decorated with the Australian flag. In both, Abdullah dissects the idea of the faceless mob who defend or disrupt the idea of the Australian nation on the basis of their own biases and prejudices.This portrait of a contemplative man skirts the stereotype by going straight to the individual and the personal – a man who may or may not be Muslim, may or may not be Australian. But, as Caliban, he represents someone who is ostracised and diminished; expressing the experience of many young Muslim Australian men, whose transition into adulthood was coloured by their exclusion from the Australian mainstream.

Abdul Abdullah,"The face of Sycorax looms out of the darkness, scrutinising the viewer with an expression that is wary and untrusting. Unlike his other images of masked, menacing and brooding faces, Abdul Abdullah’s portrait suggests a tension between openness and vulnerability, in which the gaze must be returned in equal measure – either accepting or rejecting the individual before us.The title Sycorax refers to the background character in Shakespeare’s play The Tempest, who is the mother of the half-human beast Caliban. Sycorax, already dead when the play’s action begins, is only ever spoken of by others and so exists as the projection of other characters’ memories and assumptions. As such, she functions in a manner not dissimilar to stereotypes of Muslim women in today’s media – effectively silent, and spoken of by others, rather than speaking for herself. In the play Sycorax was herself an Algerian woman, exiled to a distant island, and is thought by some academics to represent anxieties around Islamic influence during Shakespeare’s time. She is characterised in the play as a witch and sorceress – a purveyor of black magic whose claim to the island is countered by the white magic of the European interloper, Prospero. As in media portrayals of Muslim women, Prospero demonises Sycorax as deviant, projecting onto her his own prejudices and anxieties. Abdullah’s portrait articulates his experience of growing up Muslim in the suburbs of Perth in a post-September 11 world, in which he went from feeling part of mainstream Australia to being excluded as one of the ‘bad guys’. Deeply affected by the politicisation of his identity through newsprint, radio and television stereotypes, Abdullah has challenged the bias, bigotry and prejudice which has become a feature of national discourse over the past 13 years. His work is a statement of his identity as both a Muslim and a seventh-generation Australian, and an invitation to people to reconsider their assumptions and expectations of what being Muslim and Australian might be.",Sycorax,"Identity, muslim women, stereotype, mass media, anxiety, prejudice",Identity,Inequality,Violence,Inequality,Identity,Violence,Identity,Inequality,Violence,Identity,Activism,Culture
Vernon Ah Kee,"In fantasies of the good Vernon Ah Kee portrays his family members in 13 charcoal drawings that reference and critique the depiction of Aboriginal people in Australia. These are the first serious portraits undertaken by Ah Kee, whose practice embraces text-based video works and installations. Fantasies of the good originated in Ah Kee’s discovery of photographic portraits of his great-grandfather (George Sibley) and grandfather (Mick Miller) in the collection of the State Library of Queensland. The photographs were taken on the Palm Island Mission in 1938 by Norman Tindale, an anthropologist who documented Aboriginal people all over Australia between 1921 and 1957. While a valuable record of the connection of Aboriginal people to specific lands, Tindale’s photographs also infer an underlying racism in their use of identity numbers rather than names, and their close-cropped mugshot-style format. Ah Kee reclaims these scientific, historic and public photographs of his forebears by hand-drawing them on a large scale and exhibiting them with contemporary portraits of other family members also drawn from photographs. Ah Kee’s meticulous and realistic style retains the objectivity of photography but enables him to emphasise the emotional intensity of his subjects’ piercing gazes. His reclamation of the original photographs also restores them to a family history, rather than a public one, by placing them amongst their kin. The facial resemblances in these compelling portraits suggest an ongoing familial connection, reaffirming the artist’s place within the group and anchoring his position in the world. The portraits of uncles, cousins, brothers and sons are a visual record of the solidarity, continuity and endurance of a single family and, by extension, of Aboriginal culture.",Fantasies of the Good,"Family, endurance, representation, Aboriginal Australia, identity, indigeneity",Familial,Identity,History,Familial,Identity,History,Community,Identity,History,,,
Tony Albert,"The ten photographs in Tony Albert’s work Optimism show a young man wearing a jawun – a traditional woven basket unique to the North Queensland rainforest – on his back. The jawun was made by Albert’s aunt and senior weaver Ninney Murray. The man, the artist’s cousin Ethan Rist, is pictured in a variety of locations – at the football, in a supermarket, at a pool – carrying his jawun in the traditional manner: on the head and hanging down along the back. In each image the jawun is filled with objects from the artist’s daily life: a football and team scarf for the stadium; groceries from the shops; and a towel, flippers and sunblock for the pool. The jawun is a basket specific to Albert’s family’s country around Cardwell in northern Queensland. Albert’s aunt showed him the distinctive basket when he was 12 years old and explained that it had many practical and ceremonial uses. Albert photographed his cousin wearing his aunt’s basket at places Albert frequents daily. By toting it around the urban environment of Brisbane, Albert claims it as a part of everyday life rather than confining it to the realm of traditional culture. As such, he makes a claim for the integration of traditional and urban culture and the continued relevance of Indigenous cultural practices to contemporary life. Through these photographs Albert shares his own stories and that of his family, simultaneously portraying the urban lifestyle in which he grew up and acknowledging his cultural identity.

Khadim Ali,"The Haunted Lotus is a four-panel work that references the destruction of the sixth-century Bamiyan Buddha statues by the Taliban in 2001. In this work a stone Buddha reclines across the length of the four separate images and is covered by scaffolding – echoing the bamboo framework erected by UNESCO after the statues were destroyed – and surrounded by a horde of red devils with angelic white wings. The horizontal position of the Buddha evokes the legend of the 300-metre sleeping Buddha buried beneath Bamiyan Valley. Inscribed across the surface of The Haunted Lotus are excerpts from the tenth-century epic poem Shahnama (The Book of Kings) by Hakim Abol-Qasem Ferdowsi Tusi, alongside other literary and historic texts. The Persian poem has personal significance for Khadim Ali – his grandfather was a traditional singer of the Shahnama and Ali first encountered miniature painting through an illustrated version of the publication.The winged devils in The Haunted Lotus are a potent symbol and appear throughout the artist’s practice. Alluding to both good and evil, these ambiguous figures draw on the figure of Rustam, the heroic warrior of the Shahnama stories. The secular poem is known throughout Iran and Afghanistan, but in recent times the heroic figure of Rustam has been appropriated by Taliban youth who Ali heard declaring in the streets of Quetta: ‘We are the new Rustam! We are the Rustam of Islam!’ Even more shocking for Ali was meeting a young boy in Bamiyan, Afghanistan named Rustam who was unaware of the historic and mythic origin of his name, believing it to be only connected to the Taliban cause. Ali reappropriates and restores the iconic Rustam to his poetic context, updating his epic narrative to reflect contemporary political and cultural issues and the shifting nature of heroism in a war-torn region.",The Haunted Lotus,"Identity, Afhganistan, Buddha, Taliban, mythology, history ",History,Identity,War,Spirituality,Culture,Violence,Identity,Inequality,Spirituality,Culture,Identity,History
Peter Alwast,"Peter Alwast explores the relationship between the real and the virtual through a range of media, including installation, drawing, painting, video and computer graphics. The Night Sky continues his fascination with urban development and the construction of controlled spaces, such as gated communities. The video depicts a new suburban development at night. It is a cityscape devoid of people, with houses that are illuminated but appear empty, as if awaiting their occupants. Above the estate, neon texts float slowly through the air, blinking on and off, lighting up the empty streets. Referencing the language of self-help manuals, the disembodied statements are based on conversations overheard by the artist and explore particular relationships or (dis-)connections with society: ‘I am fat and alone’, or ‘A good dancer is one that shows his own virtuosity as well as dancing with others’.The landscape in The Night Sky offers no warmth or personality – it is a nothing place, like a new estate or gated community. Alwast re-creates the façade of this constructed environment using animation tools that are reminiscent of a real estate industry promotional video. The babbling brook and the click of cicadas is a soundtrack rather than an integral part of the scene. It is a perfect suburban world that is isolating and suffocating. High above the pristine roofs and clean-cut gardens the hopes and dreams of the new inhabitants are broadcast unnoticed and unfulfilled. The prefabricated town of The Night Sky is a constructed and commodified space in which nature itself seems transplanted. Alwast’s work is no celebration of this existence, rather it draws attention to the bleak interior of the new Australian dream.",The Night Sky,"Virtual reality, suburbia, self-help, facade, environment, urban development",Urbanization,Emotion,Fantasy,Urbanization,Culture,Fantasy,Urbanization,Fantasy,Community,Urbanization,Materiality,Environmental
Brook Andrew,"Brook Andrew’s Loop. A Model of how the world operates is part of an ongoing series of wall drawings using black-and-white patterns traditionally carved into shields and trees (dendroglyphs) inspired by his matriarchal Wiradjuri cultural heritage of western New South Wales. In Loop Andrew has overlaid these monochromatic diagonals with slowly throbbing spirals of neon, interspersing traditional memory in order to challenge our relationship to the inheritance of tradition in a society built on activities of trying to forget Aboriginal culture. The oversized diamond patterns create a dazzling optical effect, similar to that seen in 1960s op art. Andrew uses this dazzle, alongside the glowing neon, as a metaphor for our contemporary culture of consumption and spectacle, in which we are mesmerised by consumerism and drawn in by advertising as ways to forget cultural and historical responsibilities. What appears to be an abstract, hard-edge minimalist work is grounded in traditional life and culture; the neon coils, glowing on and off, aim, as Andrew says, ‘to hypnotise. The overall effect: Free will or submission?’ The work is a wall drawing, which is as much an idea as it is an object. It is re-created each time it is shown, and so it responds to the size and condition of its environment, whether inside a museum or outside, with the patterns expanding or contracting in scale to cover the wall. What persists is the push and pull between traditional ways and contemporary culture, looped together in an interaction that Andrew considers to be a model of how the world operates.",Loop.

Hany Armanious,"This ordinary bedside table has been cast in pigmented expanding foam in a single pour creating the effect of laminated wood veneer. It acts as an informal support for a sculpture of a type of sphinx.

Split Fountain was shown at the 2009 exhibition Uncanny Valley at Roslyn Oxley9 Gallery, Sydney. The title of the exhibition comes from a term coined in the 1970s to describe our antipathy towards things that look almost, but not quite, human: the ‘valley’ is the steep dip in empathy we experience when confronted by a robot or a 3D computer animation of a person that is not wholly convincing.

Split Fountain was one of several sculptures of sphinxes in this exhibition, where the structure of the sphinx serves as a model to explore the dislocation of head and body, object and plinth, both physically and conceptually. In Split Fountain the sphinx has been mirrored doubling the motif so that it resembles the ancient deity Janus, who guards doorways and is usually represented with two faces looking both forward and backward.",Split Fountain,"Uncanny, domestic, everyday, sphinx, antropomorphic, eerie ",Fantasy,Spirituality,Body,Body,Technology,Fantasy,Spirituality,Emotion,Technology,Arts,Design,Body
Benjamin Armstrong,"The misshapen waxen eyes in the glass cones of Old Friends are both comical and unnerving. Forlorn and deflated in their specimen jars, they appear to have popped out of a cartoon character’s head and preserved in glass for future study. Benjamin Armstrong has distorted the perfect sphere of the eyeball into unnervingly malleable shapes, sucked into the hand-blown glass cones like boiled eggs into bottles. The enucleated eye – the eye wholly removed from its socket – is a powerful metaphor in western literature. Sophocles and Shakespeare coupled the violence of torn-out eyes to the insight gained from freedom from worldly illusions in Oedipus Rex and King Lear, while Georges Bataille’s Story of the Eye invokes a set of psycho-sexual associations between eyes, testicles, breasts and eggs. Old Friends alludes to the power of this metaphor in its display of the disembodied eye, detached from its function of reading and looking.

Armstrong’s organic and handmade materials couple the transparency and fragility of glass with the opacity and malleability of wax. They create a sensual impression of natural forms, made strange through distortion and a kind of alienation. The irregular deviations from conical perfection in the hand-blown glass cones give an impression of animated organic forms, like the probing antennae of a slug or the shoot of a tuber reaching towards light. Indeed, light, sight and vision are at the heart of Old Friends. The refractive properties of glass, polished into lenses, extends vision through spectacles, telescopes and microscopes, enabling glimpses of other worlds unavailable to the naked eye. In Old Friends, we see the naked eye, extruded and contained within the glass; behaving as a disembodied vision, seeing that which sees.",Old Friends,"body, symbolism, disembodied, antropomorphic, vision, eyes",Body,Materiality,Fantasy,Body,Materiality,Violence,Culture,Fantasy,Body,Body,Space,Physics
Barbara Cleveland,"In The One Hour Laugh, Barbara Cleveland (formerly Brown Council) – a Sydney-based collaboration of four artists – stand before a video camera and laugh continuously for one hour. Over the course of the hour their laughter moves from genuine hilarity to embarrassment, strain and boredom, becoming forced and faked. The work is part of a practice of live-art performances and collaborations and draws on ideas about spectacle and physical endurance to investigate what it is to perform, and how live performances are documented.

Dressed in homemade costumes, their dunces hats, paper bibs and fake eyebrows enhance the absurdity of their performance, recalling the anarchic theatrics of the Cabaret Voltaire in Zurich in 1916 and the subversive comedy of Groucho Marx. Forcing themselves to laugh for the entire tedium of an hour creates an element of excruciation that situates the work within the lineage of performance art and acts of endurance like those of Marina Abramovic and Ulay in the 1970s and 1980s. But in choosing laughter as their action, and in appearing to enjoy themselves in the process, Barbara Cleveland parody the seriousness and austerity of much performance art and its po-faced documentation.",One Hour Laugh,"Laughter, endurance, comedy, absurdity, performance, spectacle",Emotion,Time,Body,Emotion,Fantasy,Time,Emotion,Body,Community,Emotion,Time,Arts
John Barbour,"Inherent Vice is a delicate hand-stitched and painted wall banner made from loosely sewn panels of voile, on which the words ‘inherent vice’ have been placed in a circular mandala over Rorschach-style ink blots. Pinned to the wall, this idiosyncratic banner sits at the intersection of painting and a tactile, three-dimensional piece. It is a deliberately fragile work, its title referring to the art conservation term ‘inherent vice’ – that is, the response of materials to the effects of light, handling and atmospheric conditions. Here is how the artist, John Barbour, expressed his understanding of the term: “A sculpture made of steel, bronze or stone presumably has a low index of inherent vice. An oil painting might have a medium index. Artworks made of fabric or paper, in being particularly fragile, have a high index. A human being, as a work of art, presumably also has a high index of inherent vice”.1

For Barbour, human beings, like his wall banner, are in a constant state of physical decay, heading towards an eventual disintegration that signals the end of a ‘lifetime’ – however long that may be. Barbour has woven his reflections on the transience of life and mortality into Inherent Vice through his use of non-lightfast inks, delicate fabric and loose and unstable needlework. These materials increase the work’s inherent vice index and reflect his longstanding interest in what he calls ‘unmaking’ – an acknowledgement of human frailty and a deliberate resistance to the well made.

Barbour pursued a gently ironic artistic practice, exploring the paradox between form and formlessness in a manner which has been referred to as a kind of “studied incompetence”.2 His materials of choice are modest: fabric, thread, cardboard, found objects and ink. With these he created banners like Inherent Vice and various kinds of wall and floor installations over his 30-year career.",Inherent Vice,"fragility, ephemeral, decay, delicate, disintegration, transcience",Body,Time,Materiality,Time,Body,Immaterial,Physics,Time,Body,Time,Materiality,Body
Richard Bell,"Worth Exploring? features two documents that use European legal language and logic against itself: a statutory declaration challenging the legitimacy and legality of European colonisation, and a certificate of authenticity, a common document used in the Aboriginal art market that Bell connects to forms of racial classification. These texts flank two paintings, each with their own conflicted relation to Aboriginal art. The large painted ‘E’ sets up a dialogue with two other paintings: the monumental letters ‘I AM’ of Colin McCahon’s Victory Over Death (1970) and the ‘E’ shapes used by Michael Jagamara Nelson in his paintings to indicate possum tracks. Nelson’s work was controversially appropriated by Imants Tillers in 1985. In 2001 the two artists collaborated on the work Nature Speaks: Y (Possum Dreaming) that features the ‘E’ shapes, and which Bell has here appropriated again. The second painting in Worth Exploring? is an abstract expressionist work in the style of Jackson Pollock. It refers to Bell’s demand that if Aboriginal art is to be incorporated into a western art aesthetic, it should be “seen for what it is – as being amongst the world’s best examples of abstract expressionism”.1

In Worth Exploring? Bell criticises the appropriation of Aboriginal art by non-Aboriginal artists and its domination by white curators, critics, academics, dealers and collectors. Combining political bite and caustic humour, Bell argues for greater Aboriginal control over Aboriginal art and, by extension, over Aboriginal culture within Australian society.",Worth Exploring,"Appropriation, humour, Westerncentrism, authenticity, equality, Aboriginal  ",Culture,Arts,Colonization,Colonization,Politics,History,Colonization,Inequality,Power,Culture,Politics,Land
Gordon Bennett,"Home Decor (Relative/Absolute) Flowers for Mathinna #2 is, as Gordon Bennett describes it, “at once one painting and many paintings”.1 It combines references to 11 other paintings, each relating in some way to Bennett’s principal concern with the representation of Aboriginal people. The work is dominated by the portrait of Mathinna, a Tasmanian Aboriginal girl who was painted by the colonial artist Thomas Bock in 1842. Her story is key to this work. At seven years of age, she was taken from her parents and adopted by the then Governor of Tasmania, Sir John Franklin, in 1842. She was abandoned a year later when the Franklins returned to England. Mathinna eventually went back to her people at Flinders Island and later moved to Oyster Bay, dying from complications relating to alcoholism in 1856.2

This sorry tale of theft and cultural dislocation resounds through the other works Bennett quotes in this painting, especially the Margaret Preston woodcut of desert peas that sits below the portrait of Mathinna. These are the ‘flowers for Mathinna’ in the work’s title, and they function as another reminder of the ways in which white Australia has adopted ‘Aboriginality’ without the permission of, or regard for, Aboriginal people themselves. Preston freely borrowed Aboriginal themes and motifs in her artworks, using them to establish a visual language that she believed to be distinctly Australian and which she hoped would become a defining national style.

Here, Preston’s work is appropriated by an Indigenous artist who, in an act of commemoration, offers an image back to another image – that of Mathinna – from the past. Preston’s appropriative strategy is mirrored in the other images Bennett quotes, ranging from the dot paintings of Papunya Tula, and the Ben-Day printing dots of pop art, to his own reworkings of colonial representations of Aboriginal people. This kind of borrowing from the past is both a revision and reinterpretation, and its interweaving of motif and meaning brings back into focus the images and histories that continue to shape us.",Home Decor,"Identity, representation, racism, history, aboriginality, colonialism",Identity,Inequality,History,Colonization,Identity,History,Arts,History,Identity,Culture,Colonization,History
Stephen Birch,"Stephen Birch’s installation Untitled depicts an unusual confrontation between a life-size model of the superhero Spiderman and a worm-like, bearded figure whose atrophied head sits atop an arm-like neck protruding from the gallery wall. It suggests a type of mirroring or inversion, in which a full-bodied superhero – whose potency is exaggerated by his bulging crotch – balances and reflects the portrait of his ‘defective’ and repulsive opposite.

Birch’s Spiderman is a misshapen figure: the costume and role that he now inhabits barely accommodates his imperfections. The encounter between superhero and the aged, bearded mortal raises questions about the similarities between the two – they are constructed opposites inhabiting the same fictional world. In this installation the tension between the superhero and his nemesis is made palpable. The viewer is left to witness a jarring recognition – a scene in which one character is forced to confront himself within the other.",Untitled,"Otherness, repulsion, opposites, confrontation, superheroe, relativity",Fantasy,Identity,Inequality,Body,Time,Materiality,Fantasy,Identity,Culture,Identity,Body,Fantasy
Daniel Boyd,"Daniel Boyd’s painting We Call Them Pirates Out Here mocks the official history of white exploration and settlement by suggesting that one person’s explorer is another person’s pirate. This work is a parody of a famous 1902 history painting by Emanuel Phillip Fox depicting the 1770 landing of Captain Cook at Botany Bay. Depicted as a marauding pirate, Boyd’s Cook claims possession of the land with his skull-and-crossbones Union Jack. No longer the heroic and civilised explorer of Fox’s painting, Cook becomes the anti-hero of an opposing narrative in which his landing is reframed as a moment of invasion and pillage for the original inhabitants.

This kind of reworking of significant historical works is a potent artistic tool for commentary on Australia’s history, past and present. In other works, such as Governor No Beard (2007), Boyd has presented a buccaneering narrative of Australian history in which Australia is a Treasure Island and Cook, the Enlightenment man, little more than a treasure hunter. In We Call Them Pirates Out Here Boyd has appropriated a powerful piece of propaganda. Fox’s history painting, commissioned soon after the federation of Australia, depicts Cook – and by extension, the nation – as an enlightened humanist who prevents his men from firing on two advancing Aboriginal warriors. In Boyd’s update, the warriors are replaced by two Xanthorrhoea grass trees, called ‘black boys’ by the colonists. Cook’s heroic gesture is thus emptied of meaning and we see the scene as an opportunistic land grab founded on the one-eyed myth that the country was uninhabited.",We call them pirates out here,"Coloniality, political commentary, appropritaton, history, reinterpretation, parody, anti-hero",Identity,History,Politics,Colonization,History,Land,Colonization,History,Arts,History,Colonization,Power
Rebecca Baumann,"Automated Colour Field is a kinetic sculpture consisting of a wall-mounted grid of 100 flip-clocks, the numbered panels of which have been replaced by paper cards in a variety of colours. The battery-operated clocks keep their own time, turning the paper cards on the minute and the hour to create a kaleidoscopic field of colour. As in many of Baumann’s works, the mechanisms used to activate her chosen materials, and the incidental noises these mechanisms generate, are an important element of the experience she creates. In this work the analogue clocks activate the paper cards, producing a low background hum and soft pattering sound like raindrops falling on a tin roof.

Informed by psychology, colour theory and art history, Automated Colour Field makes reference to the abstract painting movement known as colour field. Links can also be made to German artist Gerhard Richter’s colour chart paintings of the 1960s and 1970s, which mimic the charts used by paint manufacturers and incorporate chance distributions of colour. Like Richter, Baumann uses processes of chance and a commercially available colour palette in her work, describing her placement of the coloured cards as being driven by a spontaneous rather than pre-planned impulse, resulting in an arbitrary arrangement of colour.

Baumann is interested in how we subjectively perceive colour and time, and how these phenomena are scientifically visualised and measured. Her main focus is the intimate relationship between colour and emotion, and the way specific colours and colour combinations can elicit particular feelings or moods. Bringing time into this equation, Baumann links the continually changing arrangements of colour generated by the flip-clocks to the fluctuating spectrum of emotions people experience over any 24-hour period.",Automated Colour Field,"time, kinetic, colourfield, everyday, perception, clocks",Time,Design,Body,Arts,Fantasy,Mind,Time,Arts,Emotion,Time,Arts,Design
Pat Brassington,"The four photo-media works from Pat Brassington’s series You’re so Vein (2005) are at once enticing and unsettling. Body parts are photographed from odd angles, distorted, cropped and foreshortened. In one image a mouth is sliced by the edge of the frame, in another a foot is scaly and inhuman, while legs are splayed or oddly elongated. In none of these works is there a whole body nor a full face, instead the viewer is left to interpret a situation or psychological state through segments of the body that stand in for the whole, as in a fetish. The colour palette in these works is predominantly pale pink and off-white and the emphasis in the images falls on mouth, crotch or feet. As art historian Helen McDonald wrote of this series, Brassington’s pink is “impotent”, unable to “open into space, like blue” but achieving either “dull luminescence” or imploding in “a subcutaneous sherbet bomb of sensation”.1

The titles of the works are playful and open up diverse interpretations. Crush could refer to the berry red lips at the top of the image, to the claustrophobia of an embrace, or to a more sinister possibility of violence to the exposed and vulnerable neck. Topography in Pink invites a landscape metaphor to apply to the striped leggings and splayed legs. Rocket evokes the elongated machine, thrusting into beige carpet. In The Wedding Guest a reptilian or amphibian form emerges along the floor from beneath a satin hem, and the title suggests unwanted advances and psychological and bodily mess beneath fine fabric and marriage celebrations.",You're so Vein,"Disembodied, body, abject, ambiguety, fetish, phychological",Body,Mind,Fantasy,Body,Violence,Fantasy,Body,Emotion,Violence,Body,Fantasy,Space
Ian Burns,"Showtime is a kinetic assemblage constructed from plastic chairs, an electric fan, a mirror ball and a monitor. The inverted plastic chairs projecting from the wall house the sculpture’s dynamic and spectacular elements: a spinning disco ball and a monitor showing video footage of a jet plane. Their ‘jet set’ associations with glitter and glamour are at odds with the domestic mundanity of the chairs, which would be familiar to anyone who has ever browsed an Ikea catalogue. Fixed to the chairs is a heavily laden power board trailing untidy lengths of cord that snake into and out of the wall-hung work. Nothing is hidden or glossed over in this work; the mechanics of its production are laid bare, and its assembly is of a distinctly handmade and improvised nature.

The screen that fronts the work shows Air Force One – the military aircraft specially designated for the President of the United States –, in flight. However, it is not the real jet aircraft we see on the screen but a live video feed of a toy plane suspended behind the monitor. A small fan blowing against the wall creates the turbulence that moves the plane, simulating a flight above the earth that is entirely fictitious. Air Force One exists here in a closed circuit – a self-perpetuating loop in which it relentlessly broadcasts an image of itself, appearing to move while remaining stationary.

Ian Burns made this work in New York during the 2008 presidential campaign that saw Barack Obama elected. The combination of the glittering disco ball with the imagery of Air Force One suggests the global power and authority of the Office of the President and the hype and spectacle of American elections – while the plastic chairs and electrical components suggest the rather less glamorous machinations underlying them. By placing the screen centre-stage in his do-it-yourself structure, Burns manifests the centrality of screens in our lives – not just as sources of entertainment and news but also of surveillance and misinformation.",Showtime,"Stage, fiction, mass media, illusion, spectacle, misinformation",Mass media,Technology,Fantasy,Power,Fantasy,Mass media,Power,Technology,Mass media,Technology,Mass media,Materiality
Ian Burn,"Ian Burn’s Systematically Altered Photographs is a suite of black-and-white images of suburban scenes, photocopied over and over until only a dotted matrix of the original image remains. The original photographs may have come from a brochure promoting the Australian lifestyle – its ordered and spacious suburbs, modern schools and natural settings. These are images of settled and colonised places that could be anywhere in Australia, and Burn further displaces them by systematically stripping them of visual information until they become more and more meaningless. They become things in which we look at, as well as look for, information. The images are accompanied by an essay written by Burn examining the relationship between what we see and how we talk of what we see, in which the semantic differences between ‘looking at’ and ‘looking for’ show the ways in which language conditions our visual experience.

The relationship between language and perception, the image and its viewer, and between art and the society in which it functions, were overriding concerns for Burn, who was an Australian artist known internationally for his leading role in the development of conceptual art. Systematically Altered Photographs was made around the time Burn joined the conceptual art collective Art & Language in New York. Departing from his earlier interest in landscapes and paintings, Burn examined the concept of art and its commodification and operation within the art market. His practice adopted a critical self-awareness of its production and dissemination, with the aim of examining the social, political and philosophical functions of art. Systematically Altered Photographs shows Burn’s use of media reproductions and what was then the new technology of the Xerox to question our understanding of landscape as both image and idea, and to critically examine our investment in what pictures do and don’t tell us.",Systematically altered Photographs,"Suburbia, language, perception, repetition, photocopy, mass reproduction",Urbanization,Materiality,Language,Urbanization,Fantasy,Language,Urbanization,History,Mass media,Mass media,Language,Land
Jon Campbell,"In Stacks On, Jon Campbell stacks glowing lightboxes of different shapes and sizes on top of one another in an installation that captures the political and cultural milieu of the inner city though its slogans, slang and lingo. Usually the domain of advertising and brand awareness, Campbell takes lightboxes from their customary location in the street, bus shelter and milk bar and re-orients them towards a personal archive of recollections, communicating the diverse voices and cultural landscape of his upbringing through its distinctive typography, words and phrases.

Interspersed between the towering lightbox stacks are screenprinted banners hanging from the ceiling. Like the lightboxes, they declare – in a phrase or a single word – their allegiance to the memory of inner-city suburbs. The lightbox inscribed with ‘Footscray Halal meats 100%’ and the banner declaring ‘Franco Cozzo’ (a well-known Melbourne furniture retailer) refer to the multicultural character of places like Footscray and Brunswick, now an important part of their sense of place. Within this melting pot of references are words of distinctly Australian flavor, like ‘snot block’ and ‘schnitz and titz.’ These unique colloquialisms – one an unflattering description of the singular Australian delicacy, the vanilla slice (a solid block of custard held between two layers of pastry) the other shorthand for the food and service on offer at a particular kind of Australian pub ­– belong to an informal language of suburban working class masculinity.

Posters for 1970s proto-punk bands like Radio Birdman and The Saints are enlarged as vivid screenprints by Campbell and hung alongside snippets of overheard conversations – “it’s a world full of lying bastards” ­– with slogans from the proposed damming of the Franklin River in the 1980s and the suggested closure of the Victorian College of the Arts (VCA) in 2010. These stacked and floating slabs of text and slang, torn from times and places familiar to the artist, recall the voices, influences and memories experienced in the streets of urban Australia, creating a kind of unofficial history of its vernacular expression.",Stacks on,"colloquialism, slang, vernacular, Australia, text, advertising",Language,Identity,Culture,Identity,Community,Culture,Mass media,Culture,Urbanization,Language,Culture,Materiality
Christian Capurro,"Another Misspent Portrait of Etienne de Silhouette comprises a Vogue Hommes magazine completely erased by hand, affiliated works and a series of interrelated, often site-specific programs that use the core project pieces as the basis for an exploration of understandings of value, exchange, expenditure, picturing and effacement.

The work was produced over a five-year period between 1999 and 2004 by more than 260 volunteers who participated by erasing and then inscribing a page with the time it took them to erase it and how much they then earned for their time. Since 2004, and with each new presentation of the magazine, various material works are produced and contributions enacted ‘in its shadow’.

The title of the work references the eighteenth-century French finance minister Étienne de Silhouette, who was famous for his severe budget-cutting during the Seven Years’ War of 1759. At the time, featureless portraits cut from black card were the cheapest method available of recording a person’s appearance before the advent of photography. Given his harsh budgets, de Silhouette’s name quickly became synonymous with this cheap form of commemoration – the silhouette.",Another MIsspent Portrait,"Labour, history, time, erasure, economy, portraiture",Immaterial,Time,Economy,Body,Economy,History,Economy,Mass media,Power,History,Politics,Time
Daniel Crooks,"In Static No.12 (seek stillness in movement), Daniel Crooks transports viewers to a park in Shanghai where an old man performs his daily Tai Chi routine. The man’s graceful movements begin to fragment and multiply, becoming distended and mutated within the frame. Crooks’ image draws viewers into a sensual, slow-moving relationship with the man’s gestures, which seem molten and malleable, submerged in elastic time. Watching Static No.12 (seek stillness in movement) can create the feeling of entering a new dimension where the rules of time and space have changed. The densely layered drones and hums of the video’s soundtrack rise and fall in relation to the image.

Crooks is best known for his digital video and photographic works that capture and manipulate time and motion. The artist coined the term ‘time-slice’ to describe the series of works he has been developing since 1999, which includes Static No.12 (seek stillness in movement). To create the time-slice works, Crooks uses multiple cameras and a special digital editing technique, whereby small segments of moving images are selected, warped and recombined across the screen. The resulting imagery is fluid and undulating, a non-linear and multi-perspective view of movement and time.

Featuring seemingly banal environments, such as streetscapes, parks, elevators and commuter trains in his videos and photographs, Crooks transforms the everyday and takes us on a mesmerising journey into the time-space continuum. The works are visually reminiscent of the nineteenth-century photographic experiments by Etienne-Jules Marey, and the paintings by the Italian futurist Giacomo Balla. Crooks’ time-slice works capture an exquisitely detailed yet altered vision of reality, one that probes and unsettles the way we perceive and understand the world.",Static No. 12,"time, movement, distortion, elasticity, fluidity, continuum",Time,Physics,Culture,Body,Time,Identity,Community,Physics,Time,Time,Space,Technology
Juan Davila,"Juan Davila’s Sentimental History of Australian Art was exhibited in the 1983 Sydney Perspecta, and became almost at once an iconic work of Australian postmodernism. Its appropriation of a number of cultural references presents a history of Australian art that is as much provocative as it is sentimental. Davila constructs a model of Australian masculinity that combines the body of an Aboriginal man with the head of the white colonial renegade Ned Kelly, in the style of the homoerotic illustrations of Tom of Finland. His postmodern pastiche of styles and cultural markers also borrows from Australian artists such as Arthur Boyd and neo-expressionist Peter Booth, and the American pop artist Roy Lichtenstein. These ‘high art’ references are staged against the kitsch of everyday Australia, represented in the shower-curtain’s pseudo-Aboriginal design of boomerangs, strung between the broken columns of a cobwebbed temple of culture.

Davila combines these cultural markers with sexual imagery, scatological humour, caricature and a range of graphic styles to explore art’s relationship to history, culture, politics and identity in his work. He draws parallels between Latin American and Australian modernism, based on their shared experiences of colonisation and cultures transplanted from Britain and Spain. Davila’s challenging juxtapositions of imagery in Sentimental History of Australian Art draw on surrealism and its distinctly Latin American form of magical realism, employing the images and impulses of dreams and the unconscious mind to express desires and libidinal urges otherwise repressed by social convention. Davila uses this imagery to critique what he considered to be a lowbrow and culturally conservative Australian society of the 1980s, and to shock it out of its complacency. The complex relationship between art and politics is intertwined throughout Davila’s practice, questioning both the impact of politics on artistic and cultural life, and the role of art as an agent of social comment and change.",Sentimental History of Australian Art,"Art History, Australia, hypermasculinity, pastiche, symbolism, postmodernity",Arts,Identity,Culture,Body,Emotion,Identity,Arts,Fantasy,Culture,Body,Culture,Politics
Mikala Dwyer,"The large installation Square Cloud Compound explores ideas of impermanence, flight and escape. The work includes a colourful fabric-cube canopy held up by a number of lamp posts painted in prison stripes. The posts stand upright like sentinels, not only supporting the work but also holding it down with stockings pulled to snapping point. The work is an enclosure of sensory and tactile experiences, with trinkets and charms that suggest magic, bird boxes that allude to flight and departure, and lights to illuminate the way.

For this work, Mikala Dwyer has integrated all kinds of materials – from plants, mirrors, trinkets, fabric and Perspex to clay, helium, wood, paint and wool – in distinctive combinations, exploring the relationship between viewers and objects and the everyday visible and invisible forces that surround us. Interested in ritual, sexuality, magic, memory and history, and influenced by dada, constructivism and arte povera, Dwyer’s work pushes at the traditional limits of sculpture and installation.

Square Cloud Compound is, in part, a response to Cockatoo Island, the largest island in Sydney Harbour and a former penal colony and industrial school for girls. Dwyer spent time there in 2010 creating work for the Biennale of Sydney. Square Cloud Compound is partly inspired by that residency and by the darker histories and psychological moods of the island. The grim historical associations of Dwyer’s enclosure are offset by its exuberant and playful materiality. The fabric squares float like the clouds – a square cloud compound.",Square Cloud Compound,"haptic, flight, inprisionment, tactile, magic, ritual, materiality",Body,Materiality,Fantasy,Physics,Fantasy,Materiality,Body,Immaterial,History,Materiality,Arts,History
Shaun Gladwell,"Storm Sequence is a deceptively simple work. It depicts the solitary action of a skateboarder – the artist, Shaun Gladwell – freestyling on the edge of a concrete drop at Sydney’s Bondi Beach. The camera hardly moves and concentrates only on the skateboarder’s movements. Gladwell – a skillful freestyle skateboarder – pirouettes and spins within a contained space. Incorporating an organic, liquid-like soundtrack by Sydney composer Kazumichi Grime, the footage is slowed down. Movement which in real time would have a jerky rhythm becomes graceful, emphasising the relationship between the skater and the environment. As a storm approaches on the horizon, Gladwell skates while the sky turns black and the rain becomes too heavy for him to continue. The strange, poetic intervention of the natural world, combined with the well-known nature of the place where it is performed, creates a compelling and mesmeric work.

Gladwell often portrays isolated figures, undertaking choreographed acts like skateboarding or breakdancing, within urban and natural sites. His work articulates a relationship between the performer’s body and its immediate environment through slowed motion, often redefining the prescribed function of objects and spaces.",Storm Sequence,"temporality, movement, environment, choreography, poesis, nature, skateboarding",Body,Time,Environmental,Body,Land,Environmental,Body,Environmental,Time,Environmental,Land,Time
Christian Thomson,"Christian Thompson’s Gamu Mambu (Blood Song) is a single-channel video featuring a baroque opera singer performing a traditional Bidjara song. Thompson is a Bidjara man of the Kunja nation from Central West Queensland who references his Indigenous Australian and European heritage to engage with broader ideas regarding cultural identity. The complex multi-syllabic language sung in the overwrought and heavily cultured baroque style is unexpected, but also strangely mesmerising and enthralling. The Dutch performer sings straight to the camera against a coloured backdrop, evoking the simplicity of early performance video art from the 1970s. The translation of the lyrics into English at the bottom of the screen reveals a story that is simple but direct.

The minimal style of the video highlights the incongruity between the singer’s operatic performance, the complexity of the Bidjara language and the song’s bold narrative. The disjunction between the narrative and performance of the song confuses our understanding and comprehension of what it is we are seeing. Despite, or because of, the incongruity, the performance resonates emotionally. The power of Gamu Mambu (Blood Song) lies simply in the different interpretations of the song through performance and text. It is language taken from one source, reinterpreted and presented in a different context. It is also an affirmation of the power of the voice, a reminder that performance and song are powerful tools in communicating and understanding human culture.",Gamu Mambu (Blood Song),"Cultural Identity, Indigenous, incongruity, interpretation, language, communication, song",Language,Identity,Culture,Emotion,Colonization,Arts,Culture,Identity,Language,Language,Identity,Culture
Gulumbu Yunupingu,"Gulumbu Yunupingu’s vision of the night sky is one of light rather than dark. ‘My story is of the universe’, she has explained. ‘These stars are for us to see if we wish, wherever we are.’1

Yunupingu’s painting practice honours her two major influences: her father and her mother. In artworks by her father, the renowned Gumatj painter Mungurruway Yunupingu, the cruciform structure of Yunupingu’s stars is evident. He was also influential in her overall approach to subject: ‘I found the story of the constellations from the sacred songs my father used to sing. We grew up listening to him sing about them. Every day at dawn he would sing until the sun came up.’ And it was with her mother, a Galpu woman named Makurrngu, that she imagined the ‘seeing-eye’ dots that mark the middle of her stars. One night while camping Gulumbu awoke thinking it was raining, but her mother reassured her it wasn’t and said that maybe the stars were crying.

In Gan'yu – stars Yunupingu’s treasury of stars adorns a funeral pole, representing the role of the night sky in the afterlife. ‘Memorial poles are the ones of dead people’, Yunupingu explained. ‘We don’t know what the spirit is and where it goes. Maybe up to the sky.’

Yunupingu weaves with light, the crossed arms of her stars knitting together the rich tapestry that envelops her barks and hollow logs. The effect is buoyant, a proclamation of hope. Her constellations are a ‘metaphor for our universal humanity, the people of the past, present and future … a message of peace and unity’",Gan'yu - stars,"Stars, cosmology, family, spirit, tradition, ceremony",Spirituality,Familial,Culture,Familial,Spirituality,Space,Community,History,Mind,Familial,Space,Spirituality
Ah Xian,"This porcelain bust is the eighty-first in a series by Ah Xian, a Chinese-born artist who migrated to Australia in the late 1980s.  Each bust in the series is cast from a live model – either Ah Xian’s family members or friends – and each is finished in a different hand-painted and glazed decoration.  The cobalt-blue landscape of clouds, trees and pagodas that imprints China, China – Bust 81 is based on a traditional Chinese porcelain design, perfected in the highly specialised workshops and kilns of Jingdezhen in central China during the Ming and Qing dynasties.  For centuries, Jingdezhen was the centre of China’s global export of porcelain, a powerhouse of artisanal techniques and processes that were unrivalled anywhere else in the world. After the communist revolution in 1949 and the cultural revolution of the 1960s, agriculture and industrialisation were prioritised over traditional artisanal processes. Some of the workshops in Jingdezhen were reoriented to the production of statues and busts of Chairman Mao, and a social realist style prevailed over traditional patterns.

Ah Xian’s use of these once-threatened skills was in an effort to revive them, and in protest against state suppression of creativity and the devaluation of traditional Chinese culture. Following the methods of conceptual art, he produces each bust by issuing a set of instructions to the master craftspeople who paint, glaze and fire them. Each bust is, then, a collaboration between the individual and the group, fusing time-honoured techniques with contemporary methods. Through this approach, and by casting from the bodies of ordinary people, Ah Xian democratizes the format of the bust, which has generally been reserved for the likenesses of political leaders and statesman. Each bust is individual yet anonymous, a face in the crowd distinguished not by their words or deeds but by their Chinese heritage, differentiated by styles of decoration that manifest the highly refined aesthetics and techniques of a prized Chinese cultural tradition and trade with the world.","China, China, Bust 81","Identity, bust, artisan, mass production, migration, culture, heritage",Economy,Identity,Culture,Identity,Economy,Materiality,History,Power,Economy,Materiality,Culture,Identity
Khaled Sabsabi,"In Naqshbandi Greenacre Engagement, Khaled Sabsabi invites us to join the Naqshbandi Sufi Order of Australia in their devotions. The Naqshbandi Sufi Muslims are mystics who believe that one’s journey in life is the path of return to God. Sabsabi’s project presents us with a rare and privileged view into the spiritual and communal gatherings of members of the Greenacre order in western Sydney. Sabsabi has recorded continuous footage of one of their weekly gatherings in a Greenacre scout hall, which he screens on three monitors placed on the gallery floor. In front of the monitors is a carpet and low table, where viewers are invited to sit and engage with the experience they see before them – Sufi Muslims practising the devotional act of Zkir, in which prayers are chanted aloud.

The view provided by the static camera is of a nondescript room, enlivened by the presence of adults and children who sit on the floor and chant together to the beat of a tar, an Arabic drum. Toddlers wander from one person to the next and lie in the laps of their seated parents. Plastic folders with the words of the chants, of which one is presented on the low table of the installation, are passed around, from which people recite aloud or silently. The natural and unaffected interactions of the devotees in the ordinary space they occupy underscores their purposeful gathering, in which spirituality and transcendence are enacted through a communion of souls. The Naqshbandi Sufis, who come from a variety of cultural backgrounds, invited the artist into their ceremonial setting, allowing him (and us as his audience) to witness a room that eloquently explores the subtle social realities of shared spirituality, within the context of an everyday, suburban, Australian existence.",Naqshbandi Greenacre Engagement,"Islam, prayer, gathering, community, family, suburban, Australia",Spirituality,Community,Familial,Spirituality,Community,Culture,Spirituality,Community,Time,Community,Spirituality,Familial
Justene Williams,"Crutch Dance is part of a cycle of work by Justene Williams that pushes lens-based imagery into painterly, performance and sculptural realms. This work relates closely to a group of moving-image works in which Williams creates overwhelming environments constructed from detritus, photographs and suburban props. In the case of Crutch Dance, Williams has used a salvaged treadmill. The bizarre environments that the artist makes become the stage for increasingly odd actions built around repetitive, collaged movements – running, dancing, ducking and weaving like a punch-drunk three-dimensional painting. Here, a futurist figure vainly does battle with the treadmill, jerking with movement akin to a futurist or cubist dance and invoking Umberto Boccioni’s famous sculpture Unique Forms of Continuity in Space (1913).

This delirious choreography in its fabulist setting has the aura of voodoo, with the artist channelling a period from art history in an effort to reconstruct the essence of forgotten images. Through the physical collaging of materials to construct her complex sets and costumes, and the digital collaging and editing of video, Williams invokes the ghosts of artists past. The work itself has a sculptural presence – it is displayed on teetering accumulations of television monitors, placed on top of hastily painted wooden pallets. The monitors remind us of their own obsolescence – they are big, bulky, black boxes that are disappearing fast – as opposed to stylish, thin plasma screens. Williams’ embrace of both high and low art, history and salvage, painting and video, results in a hypnotic new form of recycling – a curiously ‘carbon neutral’ method of image production.",Crutch Dance,"Saturated, environment, movement, frenetic, art history, detritus,",Fantasy,Materiality,Arts,Fantasy,Culture,Materiality,Culture,Mass media,Fantasy,Environmental,Technology,Physics
Vernon Ah Kee,"Vernon Ah Kee’s text-based video work Whitefellanormalblackfellame engages the viewer in a confrontational relationship with the artist. Originally commissioned by SBS Television and the Australian Centre for Moving Image, the video is the first of the artist’s moving-image artworks. It uses an economy of means – simple ‘universal’ black-and-white font, and sharp editing between a portrait of the artist and flashing text – to critique the position of an Indigenous person within contemporary social and cultural life. The video incorporates a number of performative elements that create an immediate relationship with the viewer, including the barrage of text, the stance of the artist, the repetition of words such as ‘fella’, the use of space, the disjuncture between the audio and the written text, and the act of reading and understanding. Additionally, the fast pacing of the text and audio creates a sense of action and urgency.

Mabel Anaka-anaburra,"Mabel Anaka-anaburra was a fibre artist from Maningrida, central Arnhem Land, Northern Territory. Her bamagora, or conical mat, is woven from the leaves of the Pandanus (Pandanus Spiralis) plant, which grows near the water courses and coast line of Maningrida, halfway between Darwin and the Gove Peninsula. Made by women at Maningrida Art Centre, these traditional mats are used for a variety of purposes ranging from the utilitarian to the ceremonial. Conical mats serve many roles. In their flattened form, they can be used to sleep on or for women’s business, thus bamagora have a particular relationship to female experience and the cycles of life. As an upright cone, bamagora are regularly used to shield sleeping babies from mosquitos and flies, and to cover sacred objects of ritual significance. Weaving is an important industry in community, and is used to make fish traps, nets, baskets and dilly bags. Family groups will strip young leaves from the pandanus plant with a hooked stick, and boil them over the campfire with natural dyes made from the roots, bulbs, seeds and leaves of locally sourced plants. The coloured leaves are woven together in a circular pattern of coloured bands to form the conical mats. Bamagora are aesthetic objects as well as practical ones, expressing their makers’ colour and weaving-style preferences, and incorporating new practices through experimentation with plants and fibres to create variations in form, colour and texture.",Bamagora (conical pandanus palm mat),"Feminity, Aboriginal, culture, sacred, weaving, tradition, ",,,,,,,,,,,,
James Angus,"James Angus’ large Manta Ray sits balanced and motionless on a small plinth within the gallery space. The artist chose this creature for its complex associations, as it is simultaneously familiar and otherworldly, both gentle and intimidating, ancient and yet aerodynamic in shape. The sculptural form is anatomically correct, selected from a moment in underwater film footage that captured the beautiful downward thrust of the fins. The process of recreation involved translation by an industrial designer from the living organism to its virtual description in software. The data was then sent to a computer controlled milling machine where it was carved in solid foam like an industrial prototype, and subsequently cast in fiberglass. The final object is matte white and perfectly smooth, its shape demonstrating the forces of hydrodynamics, as though merged with modern design. This creature of natural history appears to have as much in common with futuristic spacecraft as with evolutionary biology.

The translation of animate to inanimate, and of movement to stillness is central to the long history of sculpture. In this case the immaculate surface of the constructed ray is at odds with the wet and slippery living organism, its dark hued top, mottled edges and pale underside. Angus frequently works with familiar forms, yet disturbs them to unsettle the viewer’s sense of reality. He has said that he was hoping that Manta Ray would appear “simultaneously alive and deathly”, conveying the disquieting underside of technology, digital effects and media. The fact that many rays including the Giant Manta Ray and Giant Devil Ray are now vulnerable or endangered raises another association with the still form.",Manta Ray,"Nature, artifice, tension, technology, digital media, design",,,,,,,,,,,,
James Angus,"Dom-ino Colour Separation is one of a series of sculptures by James Angus taking the form of an architectural model. It plays with the modernist architect Le Corbusier’s Maison Dom-Ino, a 1915 prototype for cheap, modular housing that could be constructed in a row, like dominoes. Angus has re-modelled this utopian vision of housing in planes of coloured Plexiglass that overhang each other, unlike the aligned edges of the house’s original design. Angus also introduces a colour separation between the misaligned levels, creating an effect akin to a newsprint error when the three colours separate and the image slips out of register. Through such spatial and chromatic disruptions, Angus invites viewers to see the world about them in new and imaginative ways.

Angus explores the tensions between the modelled idea and the built form and between the ‘colour-separated’ image and the object in this sculpture. His practice is one that questions traditional notions and forms of sculpture by playing with surface, scale and volume. His work ranges from the modest to the gigantic, revealing his ongoing interest in materials and processes. Inspired by aspects of design, architecture and nature, Angus often duplicates existing objects and then distorts them in some way: by exposing them to physical forces such as extreme speed, by turning them inside out, or, as we see in Dom-Ino Colour Separation, by a slight slippage which may be commonplace in a newspaper, but which deranges the clean lines and precision of modernist architecture.",Dom-ino Colour Separation,,,,,,,,,,,,,
James Angus,"In this sculpture, James Angus presents a bicycle as an aesthetic object; a geometry of circles, diagonals and straight lines in a design of pure and precise functionalism. Only the essential elements of bicycle design are present here – there are no mudguards, panniers, lights or bells to distract from its elegant engineering. The design of this bicycle is one that has remained relatively unchanged since its invention more than 100 years ago, when the upright safety bicycle superseded the penny-farthing. The classic frame of Angus’ sculpture is of the same kind as the British Raleigh Roadster, the Chinese Flying Pigeon and the Dutch Opafiets – objects of mass-production and transportation that have been integral to ways of life and culture for decades.

For this handcrafted sculpture, Angus melded the frames of three bicycles into one, creating a kind of platonic ideal of bike design which resolves slight differences in thickness of truss, angles of frame and fork, shape of saddle and handlebar position into an ideal form – one that seems to shift between the plural and the singular. Traces of all three bikes inhabit this final rendition, with its tripled wheel spokes and chain drive, contoured saddle and ridged handlebars.

Hovering between three sets of dimensions and proportions, the sculpture presents a visual experience akin to looking at lenticular imagery or to a stereoscopic gaze, in which two sets of slightly disparate visual information are resolved into the one three-dimensional image. These subtle differences, inhabiting the one object, speak of the slight variations between not only bikes but individual riders, for whom the bike is an extension of their body shape, size and movement. In keeping with his other works, which have distorted, shifted and played with elements of design from architecture to automobiles, Angus disrupts our expectations of an everyday object. By making us look again he reminds us that a bicycle, like a racing car, is a moving sculpture.",Bicycles,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Howard Arkley,"The ‘well situated’ home that Howard Arkley depicts is typical of those found in post-war suburbs all over Australia. Houses such as these, built in spacious garden suburbs far from crowded inner-city terraces, were the dream of a generation of Australians who had survived the hardships and deprivation of the depression and war. Sited on blocks with enough room for a garage and garden, bungalows like these were a local version of the clean lines and pure aesthetic of the International Style of modernism. They were adapted to Australian tastes and needs; with coloured fibro sheeting and red tiled roofs that came to define a particularly modern Australian landscape, often equated with monotonous conservatism. This was the environment in which Arkley grew up, and to which he returned, in paint, after a period of working in a more abstract style.

In its use of strong fluoro colour and thick black line, Arkley’s interpretation of suburbia is filtered though an intriguing combination of the formalist abstraction of 1920s De Stijl and the everyday modernism of 1960s pop art. Line, pattern and geometry are emphasised in his two-dimensional treatment of paving, windows, walls and roof lines, which flatten the picture plane without entirely eliminating perspective. The lurid colour scheme, applied using a brush and airbrush, pulses with a febrile energy that contradicts the popular perception of the suburbs as boring expanses of conformity.

Arkley’s airbrush technique, meticulously executed, imparts a mechanical, detached quality. The image looks like a reproduction of an original painting, rendered through a printing process that drops out detail and tonal variation. The soft focus of air brushing gives the image an impersonal and mass-produced, but oddly dreamlike, appearance. The house depicted is familiar in its form, yet unfamiliar in its affect – a strangeness lurks not only in its abstracted architecture but its shuttered windows and empty yard. Arkley pictures this uniquely Australian landscape through a melding of modernisms – a combination of hard-edge and colour field abstraction with pop art’s focus on mainstream culture that results in an expressionist and almost surreal treatment of the ordinary and the everyday.",Well Situated Home,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Hany Armanious,"Second hand political is an exercise in artifice in which various materials take on the form of other materials: wood imitates fire and bread, and ceramic imitates wood. This major installation muses on the nature of sculpture-in-the-round and its roles and limits – for instance, the plinths on which the objects stand are a part of the work, not just a display device.

Some of the curious objects displayed on the wooden plinths are blocks of wood, which, when placed in bread bags, look just like bread. The plastic bags, with their pictures of log cabins and Schwarzwalder forests, once held wholesome varieties of German rye, oat bran and cottage-baked loaves. Now, those same pictures advertise wooden loaves – blocks of lumber hewn to the same shape and size as loaves of bread, and chosen for their colour match to rye, black or white bread. This mimicry of the ‘staff of life’ sets up a playful oscillation between the many forms and ideas of wood displayed in the installation – the finely worked pine of the plinths, a rough-hewn block which stands unbagged, the twigs and bark of a static campfire, the references to logs and forests in the bread-bag designs, and the replication of oak barrels in ceramic drinking mugs.

This masquerade of one material for another is an amusing reflection on not just the various natural and manmade manifestations of one material, but also on its transformation into cultural objects, images and meanings – into the realm of representation. Armanious effects a similar transmutation here, metamorphosing a block of wood into a loaf of bread, and to all its secondary associations with warmth, fire, baking and homeliness.",Second Hand Political,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Hany Armanious,"The coupling of transparent drinking glasses with the opaque cast forms of their interiors in Untitled Snake Oil is more than a colourful lesson in the properties of volume, or positive and negative space. It also expresses Hany Armanious’ deep interest in the alchemical transformation of materials and his obsession with casting copies of everyday objects, transforming them from the mundane to the marvellous.

In this work Armanious has used household glasses as the moulds in which to pour brightly coloured ‘hot melt’, or synthetic polymer resin. The resulting shapes have then been placed onto the upturned glasses, the glasses acting as a plinth for each object. When placed together in this way a new shape is created, in which the translucent base and solid top echo each other. Something ordinary has been made unfamiliar and magical. This work foregrounds the negative space of the differently shaped glasses by exploring the relationship between the sculpture and the mould, something that is usually discarded in the casting process. The glass plinth is given more status than is usually the case within traditional sculpting practice, becoming a vital element of the whole work. Utterly simple yet fastidious in execution, Untitled Snake Oil implies all the childish delight in turning out jellies from moulds and sand from buckets, conveying our sense of wonder in seeing the emptiness and fullness, positive and negative, inside and outside of the same object in proximity to itself.",Untitled (snake oil),,,,,,,,,,,,,
Benjamin Armstrong,"This work is one of a series of six relief prints, which obliquely refer to Armstrong’s sculptural works in their suggestions of glass containers and vessels, and their strange associations with organic forms. Armstrong’s sculptures are evocative installations of hand-blown glass forms and organic wax objects that suggest bodies, orifices and limbs without making overt or literal references. Surreal in appearance, their rounded and elongated forms invite playful associations with the human body that are enhanced by the flesh-like colouration of the wax. In conjunction with the transparency and fragility of the glass bottles, cones and bubbles he blows with a team of people, Armstrong’s sculptures conjure the elemental possibilities of fire, air, heat and breath and the transmogrifications of materials that melt, ooze or harden as they heat and cool.

In their abstracted references to inter-penetrating beakers distilling their contents into each other in Two, and the pulsing orifice of warty growths in Untitled, Armstrong’s prints draw on the transformations of matter suggested in his sculptures. Armstrong takes an unorthodox and sensual approach to printmaking, carving into the lino and then smothering the plate in squelching inks printed on wet paper. Using the carved line of the lino-print, Armstrong conjures not only the strange look of things, but their strange feel as well; a feeling we recognise deeper in the flesh than on the surface. The uncanny forms and shapes that result in this series of six prints are abstract yet familiar – biomorphic assemblages that suggest bodily functions, orifices and organs that interpenetrate, oscillate, swell and throb.",Untitled II,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Barbara Cleveland,"The dual-screen video What do I do? shows four artists dressed in dramatic yet makeshift fashion, wearing costumes that draw on the traditions of pantomime, dunce and magician. On one screen each take turns standing alone, blindfolded and vulnerable as pelted with tomatoes. They wait helplessly, unable to anticipate the direction of the next missile nor to protect themselves from it, overlaid with the soundtrack of tomatoes hitting their target. On another screen they stand stationary as a group as though posing or immobilised by stage fright against a theatrical red stage curtain while their chorus of female voices repeatedly ask, “What do I do? What do I say?”

The four artists in Barbara Cleveland (formerly Brown Council) developed a collaborative and performative art practice that bridges gallery and stage and draws on the historical lineages of both visual and performing arts. What do I do? belongs to a series of inter-related works that use the genre of comedy. Yet the date of the work included in the title also alludes to art historical tradition, as the artists re-enact two performances from the early 1970s by New York poet, performance and video artist Vito Acconci. Acconci privately filmed performances between 1969 and 1974 that obsessively contemplated his own body and consistently explored the dynamics of intimacy, trust and power, transgressing the boundaries between public and private, audience and performer. In What do I do? Diana Smith, Frances Barrett, Kate Blackmore and Kelly Doley perform together and also alone, reflecting on the process of collaboration and on individual practice. Through this work they satirise themselves in relation to the performance ‘greats’ and enact their own performance anxiety.",What do I do?,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Paddy Bedford,"Camel Gap, by the senior Gija artist and lawman Paddy Bedford, is a story from the artist’s mother’s country that illustrates the shared recent history of Gija and non-Aboriginal people. To Gija people Camel Gap is also known as Gernawarliyan. Its English name refers to the shape of the hill itself and also to the Afghan cameleers who travelled from the port at Wyndham South to remote Kimberley communities and further afield for trade. The site is located south of Martie’s Bore in the East Kimberley in the north of Western Australia. It is connected to an ngarranggarni (Dreamtime) story of the goanna Garndoowoolany who camped out there. Garndoowoolany called out to Marranyi, the dingo, who he saw at the top of the hill. It was here that Marranyi got stuck and became part of the rock.

Bedford painted with a deep sense of cultural responsibility, using stories from his father’s country, or his mother’s and uncle’s country. Camel Gap documents the development of his painting style, which is part of the highly recognisable ‘East Kimberley’ or ‘Turkey Creek’ style that emerged in the late 1970s inspired by the landscape, stories and colours of north Western Australia. Until the time of his passing in 2007, Bedford continued to experiment with form and pictorial convention, combining large expanses of colour and dotted edging more commonly seen in the rounded forms of early pioneers of the Turkey Creek painting style, such as Rover Thomas and Paddy Jaminji, and the fluid lines of Queenie McKenzie. Bedford explored the rich history of his country and the important stories that have mapped its past, painting the bones of the landscape with the waterholes, stockyards and roads that he traversed all his life.",Camel Gap,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Zanny Begg,"City of Ladies is a 20-minute non-linear film installation produced by Zanny Begg in collaboration with Paris-based Australian film director Elise McLeod. The work was inspired by the proto-feminist novel The Book of the City of Ladies (1402), by France’s first professional female writer Christine de Pizan, which imagines a utopian city built, populated and governed by women. Begg and McLeod draw on the structure and content of Pizan’s work in their filmic installation, which was developed with a group of young Parisian feminist and activist women from a variety of cultural backgrounds, as well as contributions by leading/pioneering feminists such as Hélène Cixous, Silvia Federici, Sam Bourcier, Fatima Ezzahra Benomar and Sharone Omankoy.

Through conversation and performance, the participants engage with the issues that concern them in Paris today – a city divided over responses to terrorism and home to the inspiring Nuit debout (Rise up at Night) protest movement for social justice. Aspects of Pizan’s book are used to convey elements of the women’s own stories, experiences and perspectives, highlighting not only the persistence of misogyny across time but also inspirational modes of resistance.

The non-linear form of the film is the result of a computer-generated re-sequencing of its more than 50 core sections or sequences. The software, created by programmer Andrew Nicholson, randomly selects a different combination of sections to play during each 20-minute screening of the work, thereby disrupting the narrative arc of more conventional linear films. Its constantly changing nature consistently generates new associations between the various narratives and participants, while emphasising an expansive sense of the film existing both within a specific time and place and resonating across history and locations",City of Ladies,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Richard Bell,"Richard Bell’s Embassy project has travelled the world since it was first mounted in Melbourne in 2013. The installation consists of a large military-style canvas tent surrounded by painted protest signs with slogans such ‘White Invaders You Are Living on Stolen Land’; ‘…Why! Preach Democracy’ and ‘…We Wuz Robbed’. A sign marks the tent as ‘Aboriginal Embassy’, and the public are invited to enter and watch a screening of Alessandro Cavadini’s film Ningla A-Na (1972). This historically significant documentary tells the story of Aboriginal activism in south-eastern Australia in the 1970s, establishing Embassy as a public space for imagining and articulating alternate futures and reflecting on, or retelling, stories of oppression and displacement. In Moscow, Perth, New York, Jakarta, Jerusalem and Sydney this discussion has taken different forms as it addresses local differences in race and politics through talks, performances, other screenings and workshops by performers, activists, artists and thinkers. Each version of the installation incorporates documentation and material from all its previous iterations, building an archive of solidarity and resistance that transcends national borders.

In Performa 15 in New York, for example, activists from Black Lives Matter, the Black Panthers and the Idle No More movement gathered to screen films, give lectures and discuss issues in a spirit of solidarity. At the Cairns Indigenous Art Fair (CIAF), local elders, activists, artists and community leaders discussed strategies of resistance. Bell’s installation is itself inspired by the first Aboriginal Tent Embassy, pitched on the grounds of Canberra’s Parliament House in 1972, by four young men demanding Aboriginal land rights. They were soon joined in their protest by many others, and the Tent Embassy still stands today as a testament to the battle for Indigenous rights and political representation in Australia. Bell’s Embassy can be considered a roving satellite of the original; a reminder of the audacity and tenacity of the original tent ambassadors and a continuation of their diplomacy in the field of Indigenous politics.",Aboriginal Embassy,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Gordon Bennett,"Gordon Bennett’s work Untitled (dismay, displace, disperse, dispirit, display, dismiss) uses word and image to explore language as a tool with which the colonisers of Australia subjugated the country’s original inhabitants. Viewing the work at the MCA, near the site of the landing of the First Fleet, gives it even greater resonance, showing as it does the process of displacement and dislocation that followed the arrival of the ships in Sydney Cove. 

Bennett has combined six key scenes in the process of colonisation – the arrival of the fleet, the raising of the Union Jack, the murder, imprisonment and demoralising of Aboriginal people – with stencilled words that stamp the brutality of that process. Using a palette that successively darkens from white to black, he tracks the dismay of Aboriginal people at the invasion of their land to their dismissal as inhabitants of it, using the visual and verbal language of oppression that was integral to the colonising process. To ‘dis’ something in English means not only to disrespect; when used as a prefix it reverses and undoes the meaning of the root word, and can thus “refer to negation, opposition, separation, or deprivation”.1 The repetition of ‘dis’ in each word in Untitled (dismay, displace, disperse, dispirit, display, dismiss) sets up a rhythm; a beat which marches in grim lockstep with each image to its termination in the empty black square of ‘dismiss’.",Untitled,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Liam Benson,"Participatory Community Embroidery: You and me comprises a sequined map of Australia, on semi-transparent organza, delineating Aboriginal language groups across the country. Each sequined cluster represents a different language on the map, which takes as its starting point the AIATSIS map of Indigenous Australia and the question ‘what is country?’ Benson expands, ‘The broader question I focused on was about ‘what does it mean to be living together in present-day Australia, with an understanding that we are also living on Aboriginal land?’’

The work is suspended from the gallery ceiling from a rod so that both sides – including the criss-cross stitching that holds all the sequins in place – are visible to its audience. Motivated by Benson’s contact with Darug Elder Kerrie Kenton within a WeAve workshop at Parramatta Artist Studios, it reflects his desire as a non-Indigenous person to learn about, and engage more deeply with the history and significance of sharing a homeland which has living connections to Aboriginal culture and community. He says, ‘I wanted to acknowledge the significance and impact of the many First Nation voices who are powerful advocates for creating awareness and sharing perspective, including elders, friends, colleagues, artists and academics, who have informed me throughout my life and artistic practice.’

Many hands have contributed to the work’s realisation, reflecting the diverse ethnic backgrounds of Australians today; and Benson acknowledges Wamba Wamba man Steven Lindsay Ross – who is also living in Western Sydney – as an early contributor and consistent guide through the process. The conversations shared during the creation of this work supported each participant in contribute their voice to an ongoing dialogue of contemporary Australian identity and how we define ourselves as a diverse, interconnected nation both now and into the future.

Liam Benson,"Participatory Community Embroidery, Untitled (flag) takes the form of a handmade Australian flag, adorned with a range of motifs (a shooting star, gay pride stripes, flowers) that have been stitched by many different people who come together through workshops organised by the artist. There is a liberating aspect to this communal process, Benson says, for new arrivals to Australia who bring with them a profound sense of culture and identity. Reflecting on notions of nationhood, participants in Benson’s project are invited to decide ‘what to change and what to keep’ in relation to the Australian flag, and to personalise their relationship to it. The idea of graffitiing onto the flag – but with beads and sequins – is also explored through Benson’s work. He says: ‘it represents an open conversation about what the flag, and being Australian, means to each of us – and most importantly, that we are all joint authors of the statement.’ It is suspended from a flag pole attached to the gallery wall, extending outwards into space and visible in three dimensions.

Originally working with performance and its documentation through photography and film, Benson has turned to embroidery itself for his most recent works, often engaging other individuals and groups in their realisation. For the first decade of his practice, he recalls, he sought to unpack his own identity as a queer, white male living in Western Sydney. In the second decade, he has moved towards a wider exploration of cultural identity – of ‘who we are’ – as individuals and a nation living in the present. Through the works, he concludes, ‘different cultures and subcultures speak to one another, as an act of solidarity’.",Participatory Community Embroidery,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Brian Blanchflower,"The five panels of Particle paradise (nuclear family) are painted in earthy tones of umber, ochre, grey and black. This purely abstract work is built up from layers of painted shapes and marks, each carefully applied to provide an underlying order to the work’s apparent randomness. Uniform circular shapes appear in regular lines, interspersed with explosive spirals and gestural marks, intersected at intervals by cascading diagonals. Like staring into the night sky, with its shooting stars, patterns of constellations and intimations of infinity, Particle paradise (nuclear family) is a meditation on the big questions of existence: of time, matter, space and our place within the cosmos.

The febrile energy of Particle paradise (nuclear family) suggests the constant movement of matter in which cells divide and atoms collide, whether within the realms of our own bodies or at the outer reaches of the galaxy. For Brian Blanchflower, painting involves merging inner experience with reactions to outer phenomena. It is about opening oneself to the unknown. This work is a meditation not only on the idea of matter but on the very materiality of painting. The tinted weave of the underlying canvas can be glimpsed between thick encrustations of paint, some of which incorporate the very matter of earth itself – lint and sand. The painting thus works as much on a tactile level as it does a visual one, creating a surface tension between two- and three-dimensionality that suggests the interweaving of the physical and metaphysical in our musings upon the nature of the universe and the state of being. The notion of infinite “magical transformations of worlds within worlds” continues to fascinate the artist.",Particle Paradise,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Marion Borgelt,"The Strobe Series is an exploration of Marion Borgelt’s fascination with the behaviour of light. The works in this series are large-scale abstract paintings referencing waves of bending, twisting light. Their lurid, pulsing bands of colour are combined with nuanced, delicate shades to create a dynamic interplay with surprising optical effects. The extremes of contrast and colour play in the works are at times unsettling as the intensely coloured paintings pulse with light, phosphorescence and kinetic energy. Using strong palettes of red, white and black – or purple, yellow and black offset with bands of green, pink or white – Borgelt creates resonating waves of colour across the canvas surface.

The Strobe Series revisits Borgelt’s exploration of optical effects seen in her earlier Liquid Light series of paintings, here expressed differently and in a bolder painterly way. Her interest in colour has developed in new directions in these works, including the illusionary effects of subtle bending and layering alongside bolder, jarring and unusual colour combinations, resulting in works that are seductive and alluring with a sense of both darkness and energetic vibrancy. For Borgelt, the shrill colours reflected “a new way of bringing life into my work, getting it to radiate and become active on an optical level. It’s bittersweet … I like to hit that point at the edge of bad taste and still get it to work.”1 Borgelt has carefully blended the edges of the bands of colour with wide brushes so that they look almost airbrushed. Some bands are translucent, some are solid, some shift fugitively, others sharply, creating optical effects that are like the insistent pulse of music.",Strobe Series,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mathew Bradley,"These seven objects are from a larger ongoing body of work begun in 2015 titled One Hundred Vessels. The series will eventually comprise exactly what its title describes: 100 cast-metal vessels. The series stems from Matthew Bradley’s interest in fire and heat as transformative forces, coupled with his questioning of what constitutes vital, fundamental human knowledge and skill sets. As both archaeology and early/pre-modern history tell us, the developing ability to create objects from metal is central to narratives of human development. With the One Hundred Vessels project, Bradley implicitly poses a what if: What if we had to learn such skills afresh?

To make One Hundred Vessels Bradley researched and built his own metal furnace in his backyard using LPG canisters, and made his own tools with which to work the furnace. He then set himself the task of designing and casting 100 vessels, in part as a process of developing his own knowledge of and skills in metal casting. The scale of each vessel is limited by the size of the furnace, resulting in individual works that have an intimate, handheld quality. Bradley’s designs alter greatly from object to object; some appear to reference specific historical periods, cultures or locations, while others are more elusive – even science-fictional. In their various forms, styles and fabrications – whether rough-hewn or finely finished – the vessels suggest an archive of technological and aesthetic innovation that speaks to the continuing narrative of human development, adaptation and ingenuity. Bradley is fascinated by these processes of invention and making and his works explore the ways in which technological experimentation can open up enquiries into histories of invention, and the potential limits of human knowledge and expansion.",Vessel no.16 from the series One Hundred Vessels,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Joan Brassil,"For the sculpture Randomly – Now and Then, Joan Brassil wired solid rock to electronic components that cause their crystalline structures to vibrate at their resonant frequency. The rock cores, drilled from deep within a mountain, ‘sing’ with their own resonant energy between periods of unexpected silence. The diorite cores hang from microphone stands, sounding at random intervals, connecting lines of sight and sound between object and viewer. Hearing them sound is a reminder of the deep processes of energy transformation from molten lava to igneous rock that formed them. Brassil has noted that “this work is a measure of time, from when the rocks were formed – to one nocturne”.1

The observation of the natural world – of metamorphosis, symbiosis and the transference of energy from one state to another – are the hallmarks of Brassil’s practice. In other works she used oscillators and modulators to create soundscapes from the tones of pulsars, which are the remnants of dead stars. Brassil collaborated with scientists, astronomers, dancers and computer programmers in a number of works, blending scientific enquiry and experimentation with poetry, dance and sculpture. Her installations are poetic explorations of our place in the universe and our relation to time and space, which she suggests is never linear and can never be fully plumbed. The sense of wonder and philosophical curiosity that infuses her practice melds art and science, the tangible and intangible, to make space audible and time visible. Using sound, electronics, gravel and stone, Randomly – Now and Then spans cosmic and terrestrial time, resounding from the ancient geologic upheavals that formed the earth to the present moment ringing in our ears.",Randomly - Now and Then,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Lauren Brincat,"Lauren Brincat’s video Hear This depicts the artist alone in her studio during a residency in Berlin, speaking on a telephone to her mother back in Australia. The telephone is made from watermelon wedges that the artist slices and consumes as she speaks, literally eating her own words in a forlorn yet comical representation of homesickness. As the video progresses, the watermelon soaks Brincat’s clothes and dirties her hair and face, creating a disquieting and awkward performance.

Sound plays a significant role in Hear This, as in many of the artist’s works. The soundtrack acts as an emotive device, drawing on both personal and cultural recollections. Unassuming noises such as the cutting of a slice of melon, or a seed falling onto the wooden floor, take on greater importance in the video, emphasising both the solitude of the figure and the intimacy of the performance. Brincat’s other video works often document repetitive actions performed by the artist – walking, eating, talking, rowing a canoe. Acknowledging performance art of the 1970s as an inspiration, Brincat describes her works as pushing “physical and cognitive limits”. Previous works have seen the artist hold onto the edge of a diving platform above a swimming pool for as long as possible, play a drum kit raised metres above the ground, or walk for a distance in a field of fog.

Brincat also frequently uses inanimate objects as totems. Everyday items take on deeper significance to reference wider concepts including personal memories, particular sentiments or emotions, and art-historical events. In Hear This, the watermelon, an expensive luxury brought during a cold winter in Berlin, takes on wider connotations of home, childhood, summer and Australia.",Hear This,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Louisa Bufardeci,"The representation of the world that Louisa Bufardeci creates in Ground Plan is based on the distribution of people world-wide. Each nation is shown relative in size to its population, so Australia, with its proportionally small population, is shown dwarfed by its neighbour, Indonesia, with its much larger population. In a traditional world map, these positions would be reversed and Indonesia’s archipelago of islands would be dwarfed by Australia’s far greater landmass. But even this rendering of what we assume to be a geographical fact is unstable. The Mercator projection of the world, developed in 1569 and widely used ever since, misleadingly makes those countries further from the equator look bigger, and those closer to it, smaller. In this and other works, Bufardeci questions the veracity of our representations of global geography and politics, basing her wall drawings, installations and sculptures on statistical data acquired from UNESCO, national censuses, opinion polls and the CIA World Factbook.

In Ground Plan, Bufardeci pictures global population distribution as a series of rooms in a sprawling complex of buildings, each with its door open. The porous boundaries between each room and its neighbour suggest a free passage between borders that is not always reflected in today’s geo-political landscape. The movement of resources, commodities and people between nations and across borders is under constant surveillance and negotiation, with doors and borders closing or reopening with each new war, refugee crisis, trade pact and peace agreement. Bufardeci’s wall work shows a rendering of quantitative data as an architectural plan rather than a pie chart or column graph or the sorts of diagrams in which statistical information is generally represented. Her mapping of the global relationship between people and the space they inhabit is one that reflects on not only the unequal distribution of population, but, consequently, of wealth, resources and power.",Ground Plan,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ian Burn,"The surface of Blue Reflex recalls the glossy paint job on a car, transposed from the aerodynamic curves of a speeding vehicle to the still surface of a painting in a gallery. In his use of automotive paint applied by airbrush to a plywood base, Ian Burn has purposely created an object that betrays no sign of the hand of the artist. Unlike his previous monochrome works of blue acrylic paint on stretched canvas, Blue Reflex eliminates the textured weave of canvas and the grooved strokes of the brush. Its shiny, mirror-like finish reflects the environment around it, and those who view it. Glimpsing themselves in the patina of the high-gloss paint, the viewer momentarily becomes a part of the artwork.

In this use of reflectiveness, Burn expands upon the modernist idea that an artwork should be about the conditions of its own production. Kazimir Malevich manifested this idea when he created the monochrome and non-objective painting, Black Square in 1913. Rather than reflecting an external reality, Malevich’s painting – and the abstract works that followed it – redefined art as an object that could be concerned only with itself, with its own medium and materiality. Blue Reflex continues in this vein of self-analysis and critique, but brings another layer of critical awareness in its use of a polished surface that reflects not only the reality around it but the viewer who views it. In inviting the viewer to reflect upon themselves as they interact with art and the gallery environment, Blue Reflex implicates the viewer in not only the reception but the production of art, making the artwork both an object and an experience. In creating this shift from a perceptual to a conceptual appreciation of the object in Blue Reflex, Burn argues for a critical awareness about what art is, how it can be perceived and what role and function it plays in society.",Blue Relfex,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Bob Burruwali,"Bob Burruwal’s three-metre-tall Morning Star Pole is an impressive symbol of the important Marradjirri ceremony of Arnhem Land. Lasting for two to three weeks, the Marradjirri ceremony brings together two groups to strengthen social and economic ties. One group invites the other, who then prepares to perform the ceremony on the lands of the host. Central to the Marradjirri is the morning star pole, which the invited performers construct, decorate and transport. The dancers perform for two to three hours each sunset, their bodies adorned with ochre-painted clan designs that grow increasingly elaborate as the ceremony continues. The morning star pole appears on the final night and the dancers engage with it by working the feathered strings. After its presentation to the host group, the pole is set into the ground while the head song-man chants a list of clan names associated with the travels of the creation ancestors.

 Burruwal’s Morning Star Pole – festooned with cuffs of feathers in orange and black, green and yellow, and a range of white – evokes the grandeur of this ceremony. Three sets of feathered strings animate the pole by suggesting its action during the Marradjirri, while the clustering of feathers speaks to the constellations of the night sky and the bands of tightly bound coloured string the rhythms of song and dance.

 Burruwal is renowned for his fibre and wood creations, and for sculpting ‘willowy, animated depictions’ that can be ‘imagined as spirits gracefully traversing the tropical savannah landscape of the Northern Territory’.[1] The beauty of his morning star pole lies not only in its ceremonial function, but in its combination of distinct textures – kurrajong wood, fibre, ochre and the feathers of local birds. Like all Maningrida artists’ works, Burruwal’s pole uniquely contrasts the ephemeral and permanent, with the fragility of the feathers balancing the strength of the kurrajong.",Morning Star Pole,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Stephen Bush,"The contemplative gentleman and the lofty landscape he surveys in In search of a style recall a painting style that was over one hundred years old when Stephen Bush painted it. The subject and style of the work are typical of nineteenth-century European and American landscapes that depicted the ‘new worlds’ of Australia and America in picturesque vistas that idealised their wildness and beauty. Inspired in part by the literary movement of Romanticism, which sought man’s redemption through exposure to nature and the experience of the sublime, the solo traveller/explorer beholding an awe-inspiring landscape was a popular theme at the time.

The central figure in Bush’s painting appears in the guise of a puffy, buckskin-wearing bourgeois adventurer. Eager to embrace the unknown whilst staking economic and social claims in the name of progress, this pensive man embodies the ambiguity of such personal pursuits. As claimer, conquerer, and civiliser he stands surveying the vast possibilities that Nature affords, while mourning its irrevocable loss. The inherent duality of this civilising impulse, and its historical representation, is sardonically pilloried in Bush’s painting. He elides the artist’s vocation with that of the heroic settler/explorer, who balanced the constant see-saw of boom and bust.

Bush reiterates this style in many of his paintings to work through the legacies of colonialism, particularly in terms of Australian history and identity, but also to tease out the entwinement of history and visual culture. The paintings which both produced colonial history and are a product of it continue to line the walls of Australian galleries, competing for attention against other more recent styles which will one day also uniquely manifest their own historical moment.",New Worlds,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Stephen Bush,"The lure of Paris is an ongoing series of monochrome paintings that replicate the same image – a dramatically rocky seascape in which three stuffed Babar elephants abseil between clifftop and sea level. Each painting in the series is an original, painted from memory, with the same title; each differentiated only by its serial number. The imagery of the painting is a curious collision of serious ‘high art’ Romantic landscape and ‘low art’ popular children’s illustration. The fictional elephant depicted is Babar, a French children’s book character created in 1931 by Jean de Brunhoff. The story of Babar, who leaves the African jungle to be westernised in an unnamed city before returning to rule over his fellow elephants, can be read as a narrative of colonialism. With his natty three-piece suit and penchant for red wine and sculpture, Babar brought a very French form of western civilisation to his herd. Perhaps, as Bush suggests in the title of this work, Babar is also beholden to Paris, the locus of French culture, and its lure of style, order and bourgeois living.

Foreign elements are at work in the image – elephants in European suits, children’s book characters in a Romantic landscape – but Bush reconciles the tension between them by treating the figure of Babar as a realistic element, dramatically lit by the sunlight breaking through a cloudscape. Displaced from the simple line drawings of children’s illustration, as well as from Africa and his ‘pre-civilised’ nature, Babar has fully entered into the rhetoric of colonial imagery as a cultured adventurer taming the wilderness. Bush’s image articulates an odd nostalgia not only for the outdated products of a colonial past, but also for the hard-working nineteenth-century artists who churned out images of well-dressed gentleman explorers in distant lands.",The Lure of Paris,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Elaine Campaner,"Christmas Island is from the 2005 series Lapped by Elaine Campaner, which addresses the artist’s feelings about Australia’s border protection policies. Campaner’s photograph of a doll fenced behind cyclone-wire mesh conveys the isolation of Pacific Island internment camps, the anonymity of their holding cells and the plight of the so-called ‘boat people’. The work is a response to the Australian Government’s refusal to allow journalists to photograph or film refugees arriving by boat; as Campaner says: ‘part of my project was to make an historic record via constructed photos, which I thought of as “illegal photos”.’[1]

In this and other works, Campaner constructs the scenes she photographs from everyday, domestic objects – knick-knacks, painted plates, dolls and other toys. The sometimes distant world of public affairs and political issues is thus ‘brought home’ via familiar household things and their theatrical representation of a personal viewpoint. The surprising transformation of these objects in convincing scenarios results in often subversive works that reveal a hidden dimension within everyday materials, a sometimes sinister edge to the throwaway items of material culture.",Christmas Island,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Maria Cardoso,"The woven nets of sea stars suspended from the ceiling in Woven Water, Submarine Landscape hang in the air like the ghosts of burst fireworks, a skeletal memorial to an explosive and momentary energy. The dead sea stars that Maria Fernanda Cardosa has used in her installation are found in tropical waters around the world and sold as souvenirs in coastal resorts and towns. Cardosa was living in San Francisco when she made this work, where sea stars sold as mementoes of Fisherman’s Wharf are sourced from as far away as the Phillippines. This kind of intercontinental drift – whether through trade, migration or ocean currents – is familiar to Cardoso, who has lived in South America, North America and Australia. In this work, she presents a congregation of aquatic life forms outside of their natural habitat, dried and bleached in the foreign element of air.

The five arms of the sea stars join to form symmetrical clusters that branch across space in uniform but organic progression.  Their connections form irregular shapes that suggest the constellations of galaxies as they wheel around our planet, or the changing energy of water as it surges and laps at sea and shore. As they twist and furl in their interconnectedness, Cardoso’s sculptures resemble other life forms and phenomena – a spider’s web, a bird’s nest, an insect’s cocoon.  Like bones and fossils, these remnants of living creatures are a kind of memento mori that invites us to reflect on death and its other, life. In its repetitive structure, Woven Water, Submarine Landscape bridges the macrocosm of sky and sea and the microcosm of cellular building blocks that, like the twisting helix of DNA, form the foundations of life.",Woven Water,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Maria Cardoso,"The hundreds of dried corncobs that Maria Fernanda Cardoso has threaded on one long thick wire in Corn Cob Coil are vestiges of the fertile soil of Bogota, Colombia, where she was born. Through this choice of materials, Cardoso infuses the visual languages of minimalism and conceptualism with a specific reference to her continent of origin. Now based in Australia, Cardoso’s work explores the natural world and its interdependence with the human world using plant and animal materials in sculptures, installations and videos. Corn has been an important resource for Colombia since it was first domesticated as a crop over 6000 years ago. A staple food across the Americas, corn has a variety of pre-Hispanic mythological associations as well as contemporary connections to region and culture. Today, it is intensively cultivated in genetically-modified form to produce biofuel, and high-fructose corn syrup, the environmental and health impacts of which are now being reassessed.

Cardoso’s sculptural coils of dried corncobs evoke the central importance of corn in everyday pre-Hispanic and Hispanic Colombian life and the diversity of economic and cultural uses to which it can be put. The minimalist simplicity of Corn Cob Coil is enlivened by the varying colours and textures of the multi-coloured Indian corn or Flint corn (Zea mays var. indurate), a variety of corn domesticated before the yellow corn we are familiar with. Stripped of their seeds, the corncobs are the skeletal remains of a life-sustaining crop that speaks directly to the heritage and collective identity of Hispanic Latin America.",Corn Cob Coil,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Maria Cardoso,"In On the Origins of Art I-II Maria Fernanda Cardoso explores the art forms of the animal world through the mating rituals of a tiny Australian spider. Her subjects are Maratus, the highly visual eight-eyed jumping spider know by the common name ‘peacock spider’. Like peacocks and birds of paradise, the male Maratus has developed a complex system of courtship display that exhibits its prowess as a dancer, musician and visual artist. Cardoso has recorded their ostentatious mating ritual using HD macro cinematography and a laser vibrometer, capturing their conspicuously colourful dance and the distinctive beat they make with their vibrating abdomens. Unlike a nature documentary’s depiction of species in their natural habitats, Cardoso films the spiders’ rituals against a stark white backdrop, emphasising the aesthetic beauty and the choreographic nature of their courtship.

Projected onto two screens on opposing walls, the male Maratus is seen waving its legs to get the female’s attention. They strut and sway to their own accompaniment – a percussive beat that is amplified as a hyper-real sound with a tactile dimension. The climax of the Maratus’ performance is the unfolding of an abdominal flap that fans out in an iridescent array of colours, like a peacock tail, which you can see more clearly in the two prints that accompany the video. If impressed by the male’s artistry, the female will allow him to approach her. In presenting an art form of performance and display that is not created by, or for, humans, Cardoso argues that humans are not alone in their production and appreciation of the arts. The performing spiders that make these artworks are the product of an evolutionary process of sexual selection that has refined and enhanced their sensory apparatus, creating a discerning aesthetic sense controlled by the females, in which each performance’s aim is to perpetuate life over to the next generation.",On the Origins of Art,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Gary Carsley,"The two figures of Labyrinth chase each other over a cartoon-like maze that is part street map and part children’s boardgame. The simple and highly stylised design employed by Carsley, with its branching pathways, directional arrows and hidden numbers, resembles a snakes and ladders board. The labyrinth traced by the arrows moves multi-directionally from the spot marked ‘you are here’ through a territory of picture book medieval towers to no discernible end point. Overlaid on on this busy map are two cut-out figures caught mid pursuit, frozen in a game of kiss-chasey. Their age and sex indeterminate, they suggest the push and pull of human relationships as they simultaneously flee and embrace each other.

The flattened two-dimensional plane of both the figures and the background in Carsley’s painting are similar in style to those of Keith Haring, whose works were inspired by the street art and graffitti of New York. While Haring’s work is directly identified with its own moment – the 1980s and AIDS activism – Carsley’s Labyrinth looks back to a distant past. The grey toned background is peppered with stylised renditions of  the arches and domes of Romanesque architecture, and its central place finder is marked in Gothic script. Flies, rats, frogs and a deaths-head evoke medieval imagery of plague and pestilence – perhaps as an oblique reference to the scourge of AIDS that struck in the 1980s, sometimes compared to the Black Death that ravaged medieval Europe.

The labyrinth of Greek mythology, where Theseus bested the Minotaur, was a dangerous place of entrapment and confinement, where monsters lurked and only the cleverest escaped unscathed. Carsley’s Labyrinth appears to be a more frivolous game, but at its centre lurks a darker spectre, warning of the dangers inherent in taking the wrong turn or following the wrong path as we chase our desires.",Labrynth,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Gordon Bennett,"John Citizen is the pseudonym of the artist Gordon Bennett; it’s a name chosen to suggest Mr Average – the Australian everyman of no stated colour or creed. Working under this name rather than his own allowed Bennett to experiment and indulge in other streams of thought in his multi-disciplinary practice. It served as a counterpoint to Gordon Bennett, his ‘other’, and yet they are one and the same. It also served as a mechanism through which he was able to sidestep some of the challenges of identity politics and the categorisation of his works within the confines of race. When Bennett is labelled an ‘Aboriginal artist’, he is ‘othered’ as an Aborigine and all the preconceptions that that entails. John Citizen lets Bennett take his Australian citizenship and cultural upbringing back from the nether world of the imagined ‘other’. Bennett refused to be stereotyped as an Indigenous artist, which he believed equally misrepresented his Scottish/English parentage. The alter-ego of John Citizen is not a denial of Bennett’s cultural heritage; rather, it is a way of shifting the interpretation of art away from the artist to the artwork itself.

The pop-art-inspired painting Interior (Orange Chair) depicts the kind of minimal, modernist décor found in interior design magazines and ‘lifestyle’ designer catalogues. Canvassing stylish and opulent imagery from the public domain, the work is devoid of detail and shading, and resembles a screenprint in its flat blocks of colour and graphic simplicity. On the feature wall of the room, above a tasteful display of cushions, hangs a painting from one of Bennett’s own series of abstract works. John Citizen thus borrows the work of Bennett and incorporates it into his own; it’s a form of appropriation which shows that Bennett’s painting – whatever its cultural origins – is at home anywhere in the world.",John Citizen,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tony Clark,"1992 is comprised of 18 small paintings on canvas boards installed in three rows of six. They feature an organic line that flows across the panels, creating vivid curving forms that switch colour when they cross onto an adjacent board. Clumpy trees feature in some of the panels and their colouration also shifts sharply when intersected by the curving line. The natural forms are clearly secondary and subsumed by the overall aesthetic.

Tony Clark is known for his vivid serialised landscapes that mix and match elements from disparate art historical and design traditions. In 1992 Clark takes the genre of landscape painting and infuses it with decorative design as well as ideas central to late modernism, including abstraction, minimalism and conceptual art. Several of the panels are entirely abstract, devoid of naturalistic features, using a visual language of shape, form, color and line to create a composition. The painting on the lower right is a yellow minimalism monochrome. The form of the work, composed of multiple objects in a series, is aligned to conceptual art in which the concept or idea involved in the work takes precedence over traditional aesthetic and material concerns. However, the psychedelic colours and curving forms are typical of 1960s design in graphics, interiors and fashion.",1992,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Lorraine Connelly-Northey,"Waradgerie (Wiradjuri) country in central New South Wales is vast, with hills in the east, river floodplains and grasslands in the interior and mallee to the west. It is known as Three Rivers Country, as the Murrumbidgee, Kalari (Lachlan) and Wambool (Macquarie) rivers course through it, teeming with life. But as the colonial frontier spread west from Bathurst in the early 1800s, the Three Rivers Country was surveyed and cleared, dissected and demarcated, and kilometres of fencing spread through Waradgerie land like cracks through ice.

In her epic installation Three rivers country Lorraine Connelly-Northey wrestles with this history, employing the objects of western industry to map her country. The materials she uses marry the two foundations of her practice: the heritage of her Waradgerie mother and the heritage of her Irish father. While her father encouraged her use of discarded materials, it was as a young child with her mother that she honed her fine handiwork skills through crocheting and sewing. As Connelly-Northey explains: ‘I set out to ensure that however my art developed it would represent my parents equally.’1

In this work the snaking rivers dominate, shifting from rusted rippled iron and the delicate open weave of agricultural fencing to the familiar lacework of rabbit-proof wire. Tying these forms together are coolamons: oval-shaped bowls that form both the riverbanks and the great, cultivated plains of the interior. The work, says Connelly-Northey, ‘pays homage to my mother’s knowledge of water on country … [and represents] the land of the “Waradgerie Winnowers”.’ But it also speaks to her mother’s life experience, ‘born and raised on the banks of freshwater rivers’ in shanties patchworked together with discarded materials like those Connelly-Northey uses in her works of art.",Three Rivers Country,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Timothy Cook,"The title of Timothy Cook’s work Kulama relates directly to the Tiwi initiation ceremony of the same name traditionally performed in the early dry season when the ‘cheeky’ round yam, kulama, is harvested. The circular motif suggests the ceremonial dancing ground, the round fire-pit in which the yams are cooked and the rings that become visible around the full moon at the time of kulama.

For the Tiwi, individual interpretations of Jilamara (design, pattern and colour) remain very personal aesthetic responses to Tiwi culture and the Kulama and Pukumani (funeral) ceremonies. In addition, artists find inspiration in everyday activities such as hunting, fishing and painting. At Jilamara Arts & Crafts Association on Melville Island the artists are bound by close kin relationships in which they support and encourage, as well as challenge, each other’s arts practice.

Along with his community of artistic peers, an early inspiration for Cook were reproductions of Tiwi bark paintings commissioned by the anthropologist Charles Mountford in 1954. Since 1996 Cook has explored the elemental forms of Jilamara and Kulama found in the Tiwi archive with a raw immediacy, developing his own distinctive style of intense dotting, striking blocks of colour and expressive gestural marks. Shifting between magisterial canvases and works on paper such as Kulama, Cook has exploited the full potential of scale in his work along with the textural materiality of natural ochre, a marker of Tiwi country.",Kulama,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sophie Coombs,"Sophie Coombs’ multi-disciplinary artistic practice includes drawing, the production of artist’s books, sculpture and installation.

These intricately drawn works on paper testify to an obsessive, detailed drawing practice, on which the artist works for concentrated periods of time. For Coombs, ‘metaphysical drawing’ is a meditative activity as well as a way of comprehending the imaginary and the material world. Thoughts are reproduced as patterns, and drawing becomes a form of writing, akin to keeping a journal. The link between stream-of-consciousness and the activity of the hand is paramount.

Starting with a blank piece of paper, and using felt and fountain pens, Coombs gradually fills the surface with small conjoined freehand circles that play with difference in line, texture and tone. Working on a drawing over a period of months, Coombs’ composition as she describes it will ‘unfold’. The immersive process is the key rather than the pursuit of a particular result.","Untitled sc/ab/102/2001, 2001",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Peter Cripps,"Peter Cripps’ Another History for H.B. and R.L. references Austrian artist Herbert Bayer (H.B.) and the Australian scholar Robert Lingard (R.L.). Lingard is a professor of education who, like Cripps, is interested in the speculative nature of culture and ideas. Bayer was an artist who taught for a time at the Bauhaus in Germany during the 1920s and then in the United States where he continued to advocate for artistic pursuits that were integrated into the fabric of a modern industrialised society.

Bayer was well known for his graphic design but also his ground-breaking exhibition displays. In the form of a drawing he proposed a radical viewing experience that encircles the viewer in a fragmented yet enclosed space. Cripps’ work realises Bayer’s drawing into a three-dimensional form with flat panels and the addition of mirrored surfaces that critique the system of viewing objects from the front. By re-creating Bayer’s proposal, Cripps’ work considers the role of history in art and how ideas from the past can travel with people and through time.",Another History for H.B. and R.L,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Adam Cullen,"With its bold but simple composition, startling use of colour and raucous brushwork, Pirate is a classic example of Adam Cullen’s painterly technique and his fascination with the renegades, mavericks and tragic characters on the edges of society. These outsiders often formed the subject matter of his bold and provocative paintings. Raw and expressive in style, these works combine satirical, irreverent humour with relentless honesty to re-examine contemporary society.

Cullen’s pseudo-naïve style and use of offensive or abject materials aligned him with the Sydney grunge movement of the 1990s and established his early reputation. His work is challenging and often aggressive in both its subject matter and execution, addressing social issues such as racism, oppression and corruption. Cullen considered his investigations of the darker side of humanity as honest examinations of his environment, resulting in work that is unforgivingly dystopian, yet with a unique, painterly beauty. In Pirate, Cullen’s depiction of the melancholic romanticised anti-hero, with his downcast blackened eyes, is perhaps evocative of failed endeavours, of an impenetrable inner world, and of the darker sides of the psyche and society.",Pirate,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Aleks Danko,"Aleks Danko describes the face in this painting as that of an idiot. This brainless, disembodied head is a recurring motif in his work, first appearing in Taste in 1988 and again in the installation Taste: the DUH-HEADS in 2013. With its staring eyes and foolish grin it could register any emotion, from surprise to terror to embarrassment. Danko uses it to signify a kind of mindlessness, clustering a number of the vacantly staring faces in his installations to create a sense of a mob mentality; the unthinking and unblinking conformity of the crowd. 

The face itself has an important historical precursor: it is based on a child-like drawing in Plate 1, ‘The sculptors yard’, from the book The Analysis of Beauty (1753) by the English artist William Hogarth. Hogarth’s analysis centred on what he called ‘the line of beauty’ – a serpentine S-shaped curve that created elegance, grace and variety in composition. That line is entirely absent from Hogarth/Danko’s simple red face, originally used by Hogarth to demonstrate the artistic simplicity of a naive style, ‘composed merely of such plain lines as children make’ and displaying ‘the most contemptible meanness that lines can be formed into’.[1]

These kinds of aesthetic judgments and pronunciations on beauty made by satirists like Hogarth are precisely what Danko embraces and employs in his art practice. Danko reprises the simple drawing as a wood and steel sculpture that refers to the history of his own use of the motif, and also to its longer history as an example of the ‘unartistic’, to continually critique any imposed idea of ‘good’, ‘bad’ or constructed taste. The recurrence of this face in Danko’s work is a reminder of the importance of independent thought, outside the bounds of convention and conformity.",Incident-Ambivalence,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Aleks Danko,"The miniature cast aluminium house that tops the steel obelisk in DAY IN DAY OUT (epitaph version) is a recurring motif in Aleks Danko’s work.  In its symmetry and simplicity, in which two windows flank a door centred beneath a gable roof, it is the very archetype of ‘home’.  The idea of home, and its associations with identity, comfort and complacency, is a concept subjected to constant scrutiny in Danko’s work.  As the Australian-born son of immigrants, Danko’s childhood home in Adelaide was an enclave of the Ukrainian traditions and Russian language of his parents. Working at a local rubber factory, Danko’s parents conformed to the great Australian dream of home ownership and a life of stability and security in the suburbs. Danko’s installation of the four framed works surrounding the obelisk in DAY IN DAY OUT (epitaph version) is a deadpan tribute to his father, who caustically described his life as a pensioner in terms of ‘Day in, day out, twenty-four hours closer to death.’

The bleak life-cycle that Danko describes in the framed words Birth, School, Work and Death can apply to all walks of life, not just one lived in the suburbs. But with the child-like bungalow at its centre, Danko draws these life stages within the orbit of the one place – the suburban home. A deep ambivalence thus inhabits this deceptively simple work because, in the Australian cultural imagination, the middle-class suburban home can be either a place of refuge or a place to leave; a source of comforting security or crushing conformity.  DAY IN DAY OUT (epitaph version) could, then, be either a tribute to traditional values or a monument to monotony. In his simple statement of four words, Danko summarises the sameness of everyone’s lives, no matter where or how they are lived, what they achieved or what they aspired to. In encapsulating the predictable passage of any existence, DAY IN DAY OUT (epitaph version) proclaims a liberating resignation to life’s essential structure and its inevitable conclusion.",DAY IN DAY OUT,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Juan Davila,"Portrait of Bungaree is an example of Juan Davila’s distinctive and dramatic collage paintings from the 1980s and 90s. It features quotations from art history and popular culture, and connects with a history of hybrid modernism in Latin America, where Davila was born.

Bungaree was an Australian Aboriginal man who came from Broken Bay, just to the north of Sydney. He was a familiar figure in early colonial Sydney, who welcomed the newly arrived to his land on Sydney Harbour and acted as a mediator between the European and Indigenous communities. Bungaree accompanied Matthew Flinders during his circumnavigation of Australia, from 1801 to 1803, playing a key role in the survey’s success as interpreter and negotiator with Indigenous groups along the coast.

In Portrait of Bungaree, Davila uses multiple and fragmented references to question the hierarchies applied to images and cultural material, challenging the dominance of European and American art from the perspective of Chile (Davila’s birthplace) and Australia, where he later lived. For many years Davila has brought to high art the visual language of the street: tarot cards, comic strips, pornography, political cartoons and cheap souvenirs. His subjects are often people of ambiguous gender, mixed race or, as is the case with Bungaree, marginalised social status. In Portrait of Bungaree and other works Davila questions public attitudes to identity and sexuality, presenting incisive analyses of what he views as the complacency, monotony and questionable ethics of much contemporary culture.",PORTRAIT OF BUNGAREE,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Super Critical Mass,"Moving Collected Ambience is a sound work designed specifically to respond to the collection, galleries and new building of the MCA, Sydney. The work was commissioned by the Performance Space and the MCA as part of the Sonic Social performance season and premiered on the 14th and 15th of June 2014 throughout the level two galleries of the MCA. It was created and directed by Julian Day and Luke Jaaniste as part of their ongoing project Super Critical Mass. 

For this performance-installation a large and diverse group of volunteer participants are brought together to create a field of simple vocal sounds for the duration of one hour. There is no set number of vocalists but generally it includes between 50–100 individuals who are following memorised instructions. Their vocalisations vary between open or closed mouths, high or low notes, individually sung or in unison, depending on the proximity to other singers and also to the artworks. They move throughout the gallery spaces, gathering in specific rooms over this time, moving individually or clustering in groups of two or three. The participants are virtually indistinguishable from other members of the public and adopt the meandering route and unfocused, yet constantly refocusing, gaze typical of gallery visitors.

Super Critical Mass deals with the nature of community building and how groups of unrelated people move towards a common consensus despite their differing identities. Moving Collected Ambience creates a temporary and intangible experience dealing with the overlap between sound, space and social relations within the MCA galleries.",Moving Collected Ambience,,,,,,,,,,,,,
David Malangi Daymirringu,"David Malangi Daymirringu learnt to paint by watching his elders prepare for ceremony, later beginning his art practice at the mission on Milingimbi Island off the coast of Arnhem Land in the Northern Territory in the 1950s. The funeral of Gurrmirringu, as depicted in this bark painting, became his signature subject, one he would return to and experiment with, focusing on different aspects and perspectives.

The story of the great ancestral hunter Gurrmirringu is related to a place called Mulanga in Manharrngu country in Central Arnhem Land. On returning home after a successful hunt, Gurrmirringu rested under wurrumbula, the white berry bush, but an evil spirit disguised as dharpa, the king brown snake, was hiding in the tree roots. The snake bit and poisoned Gurrmirringu and, as he was the first man, his death brought forth the Marnharrngu clan’s first mortuary rites.

Malangi was born into the small clan group of Manharrngu, the people of the mangrove. Through his father he inherited the Dhuwa moiety lands of Mulanga and Nurrunyuwa on the eastern bank of the Glyde River, and Dhamala and Dhabila on the western side of the river, and through his mother the Yirritja moiety lands further west near Yathalamarra billabong.

Framing the central scene of Malangi’s bark painting is the wurrumbula in flower. As a formal structure these trees divide the painting, the symmetry honouring the highly ordered structure of the ancestral narrative and funerary ceremony to which it is linked. In the shadow of the trees’ boughs lies Gurrmirringu’s body as he is prepared for burial, the crosshatched designs on his torso representing his clan. Surrounding figures play the clap sticks and didjeridu, while the animals and triangular sections of wallaby meat signify both the spoils of Gurrmirringu’s hunt and the mortuary fest.",Mortuary rites for Gurrmirringu the great ancestral hunter,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Destiny Deacon,"Mickey Mouse, the archetypal figure of white American consumer culture, appears to have left ‘The Happiest Place on Earth’ and taken up residence in the body of an Aboriginal Australian man, dressed as a woman, in Destiny Deacon’s Where’s Mickey? In a childish game of dress-ups with white gloves, fake ears and a 1950s hat, Deacon parodies the Mouseketeers – the happy, smiling, white children of Disneyland and the television show The Mickey Mouse Club. This program was broadcast internationally in the late-1950s, a period in history that particularly interests Deacon as it pre-dates the many changes to social, race and family relations of the civil rights movements of the 1960s.

Importantly for Deacon, the Mouseketeers presented an idealised, sanitised version of what American children should be like. By presenting a black Mouseketeer in this satirical ‘lo-tech’ dress-up, Deacon highlights the exclusion of non-white people from mass media and corrects this historical discrimination. By presenting a man dressed as a woman, an adult playing a child’s game, Deacon’s comedy further unsettles the binary distinctions which have shaped western culture and its constructions of race and gender.",Where's Mickey?,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Frances Djulibing,"Frances Djulibing’s installation of suspended feathers reimagines a landscape of trees and birds and a narrative of star and sky in the form of a mobile sculpture. Djulibing is a Yolngu woman from Arnhem Land in Northern Australia. The manufacture of fibre and cordage from trees and grasses is an important cultural activity in Arnhem Land, and Djulibing continues to innovate within these practices, using the traditional weaving techniques taught by her mother, Nancy Muwalpindi. For Yukuwa, Djulibing has spun twine from the bark of the banyan tree, a native fig that grows by sending down aerial roots. Banyan trees (ficus virens) are not ‘planted’ in the ground, but deposited in the branches and stems of other trees by birds who have eaten the banyan seed. Like the cascading white cockatoo feathers in Yukuwa, banyan roots want to be tethered to the earth.

The inner bark from the banyan’s aerial roots is pounded, peeled, dried and rolled into a light-brown string that can be used for many purposes, such as fixing spearheads to shafts, for fishing lines, bags and baskets. Sometimes red earth is mixed into the fibre, prior to spinning, to make a decorative coloured twine used for arm bands and body decoration.

The feathered strings of Yukuwa are similar to the pul pul decorations that hang from the morning star poles made by artists from Elcho Island. The downy tufts on the tips of some morning star poles represent Venus, the brightest star in the night sky, which is said to be hidden by an old woman in a special feathered bag during the day, and released – tethered to a string – during the night. Yukuwa reinterprets these cultural reference points in a kinetic installation of feather and string, spun from the very roots and wings of Country.",Yukuwa,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ADS Donaldson,"Untitled (for Mary Webb) is more than a carpet. It is a woven floorwork that pays homage to a painting by Mary Webb, an Australian artist who bridged the art worlds of Sydney and Paris in the post-war years. ADS Donaldson’s colourful hard-edged design is based on a black-and-white reproduction of an abstract painting by Webb. Although she was a notable mid-century avant-gardist and pioneering collage artist, little is known of Webb today. As he has done for other expatriate abstract artists whose work has been overlooked, such as JW Power and Gerald Ryan, Donaldson reprises Webb’s work in a woven reimagining that shifts the work from wall to floor, and from canvas to wool.

Donaldson’s practice as a painter and sculptor has had a long-standing concern with colour and abstraction. His series of Oranges, Purples and Greens address the trans-global nature of abstraction, conceptualism and minimalism. In devising visual languages which transcended time and place these styles overrode historical and cultural specificity, enabling art that was not tethered to national identity. Artists like Mary Webb, who introduced Australian painters to the international art scene during her post-war sojourn in Paris, were instrumental in linking art practice in Australia to this modern global perspective.

In translating Webb’s work to a woven floorpiece, Donaldson engages with the experimental materiality of mid-century practice, in which artists from the Bauhaus onwards worked with textiles, weavings and fabrics to democratise art, making it mass-producible and available for everyday life. In referencing this other trajectory of modernism, Donaldson navigates the spurious yet problematic split between art and craft that has dogged art history and marginalised craft practitioners, who were often women. Untitled (for Mary Webb) is, then, more than a carpet. It is a lesson in what gets overlooked in the broad sweep of history, and how the retrieval of forgotten fragments can make us think twice and look again.",Untitled (for Mary Webb),,,,,,,,,,,,,
Heather Douglass,"These six steel panels, painted with words and images describing life within the Titjikala community in the Simpson Desert, have been reclaimed by Heather Douglas from an old water tank that once stood on Maryvale cattle station. The panels are weathered and stained by the artesian waters deep below the surface of the desert earth, marking them with rich earthy ochres. Maryvale cattle station became a gathering place for the Titjikala community and southern Arrernte families in the 1940s, when they gravitated to the station to work as stockmen and domestic helpers. In these panels, Douglas remembers and records the past history and activities of the community.

This old bore-water tank, and others like it, was an important cultural and historical marker for the Titjikala community – especially the women – who lived on the Maryvale station. Women would walk great distances to collect water to carry back to the camp for everyone’s use. The creeks and tributaries that fed the wells and tanks were old gathering and playgrounds, where women would wash clothes in preparation for Sunday church while children played in the creek bed. Douglas has depicted activities such as these on the panels, recalling the ‘old times’ when there was no running water system feeding the camp. Douglas was raised in the community by her aunties, and her grandfather’s initials are engraved on the surface of one of the water tank panels. Many community members recall the sinking of the wells and the activities of station work and leisure that centred on the water they provided – washing, cleaning, swimming and yarning. In reclaiming the panels, Douglas reclaims the shared histories and stories of life on the station, and records the memories of her community.",Irititja Tjuta 1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Richard Dunn,"In his four-panel painting, 1919, Richard Dunn weaves together two different forms of political expression, both of which speak of the radical changes to the political and social order caused by the 1917 Russian revolution. The four panels of the work appear to be painted in two distinctive styles which when intersected form a cross. The horizontal section is a black and white rendering of a 1919 newspaper illustration, while the vertical is a copy of a 1915 painting by the Russian Suprematist artist, Kazimir Malevich. Each image is taken from a printed source and this is their commonality.

 The geometric shapes and strong colours of Malevich’s painting, Supremus #50 (1915), were part of a new language of art, developed at the turn of the twentieth century in tandem with a wider disruption of the political and cultural order in Europe. Suprematism, the movement pioneered by Malevich, was a reaction against realism and conservative 19th century representation in painting – of the ‘old order’ – and an articulation of an entirely new approach to art and politics that rejected tradition. The radical abstraction of Suprematism coincided with the radicalisation of politics in Europe in the first two decades of the twentieth century, which culminated in socialist uprisings and the Bolshevik revolution of 1917.

 Layered across Dunn’s copy of Malevich’s art political statement is a social political representation, drawn from a 1919 Brisbane newspaper illustration.  It depicts the physical clash of political ideologies in the streets of Brisbane, when 8,000 returned AIF soldiers fought trade unionists and socialists at ‘Russia Hall’ in March 1919.  The violent confrontation, known as ‘The Red Flag Riot’ because of the outlawed red flags and banners carried by the trade unionists, was caused by heightened fear of Russian emigrés - what are now called ‘refugees’ - seen to be aligned with the Russian Revolution, and associated with communism, worker unrest and the fear of revolution. Dunn’s layering of these two representations of political events, occurring on different sides of the world, shows how global politics were manifest locally, and differently; from Malevich’s radical aesthetic expression in Petrograd to the journalistic representation of right wing riots in Brisbane four years later.",1919,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mikala Dwyer,"Mikala Dwyer made these monochromes painted in nail polish for the 1995 Istanbul Biennale. A number of them were shown as part of the installation Woops (1994), a corner assemblage of suspended lame, strewn satin and stretched pantyhose that crossed a ‘bad’ teenage girl’s bedroom with a burlesque drag queen’s dressing room. Amongst the collection of hung and wrapped objects in the installation was a table of colourful nail polishes; the walls were hung with small canvases painted in their pearly hues. These monochromes acted as a mock minimalist counterpoint to the showy excess of the installation; discreetly standing back and paying homage to the idea of art as paintings on a wall, yet conversing with the ribald installation through their shared language of lurid bodily adornment. The paintings were also the only purchasable, and therefore collectible, part of the installation.

Dwyer has incorporated elements of the feminine masquerade in a number of her works, working with fabrics and accessories strongly associated with dressing up and adornment, such as organza, pantyhose and makeup. Through these materials she conjures associations with the body, with a particular kind of feminine identity and with the rites of passage that create that identity. In No, not ever, the range of nail polish colours in the titles is a reminder of the pleasures of choice in creating an identity, in expressing a social persona, and of accessorising an outfit. The nail polish paintings create an empathy between artist and viewer, a sharing of experience about what it is to create a work of art – whether it be a painting on a wall, or (always a work in progress), ourselves.","No, not ever",,,,,,,,,,,,,
Helen Eager,"Tango is a wall painting by Helen Eager created specifically for the staircase leading from the MCA’s quayside entry to level one. The work is visible from within the building but also from without and was commissioned by the MCA in 2003 for the reopening of the newly constructed galleries and public spaces. Extending approximately 15 metres in length and seven metres at its highest point, the result is an arrangement of equilateral triangles in bright orange hues that cascades down the stairs towards the light-drenched entrance.  

The triangular forms appear to interact and dance and the painting is filled with movement. The colours are affected by light, and shift and change throughout the course of a day. Eager observes that the title is a respectful tribute to Dance (1910) by Henri Matisse and to Piet Mondrian’s Broadway Boogie Woogie (1942–43) where colour and form dance together. Tango is Eager’s largest work to date and she cites Sol LeWitt as an influence, along with Agnes Martin, Ellsworth Kelly and Bridget Riley. Like the wall drawings of LeWitt, Tango came with detailed instructions so that it can be re-created at a later date.

Eager intended for the work to be joyous and uplifting. The three shades of orange were inspired by masses of nasturtiums in her garden.[1] She describes orange as a ‘gregarious’ colour and chose it for energy in the entrance foyer, and as a foil for the blues and greens of the harbour outside.",Tango,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Emily Floyd,"Each print in Emily Floyd’s series It’s Time (again) graphically represents the words of Australian politicians, writers and actors of the 1970s – a decade that was a turning point in Australian society. In her previous sculptural work, Floyd used text and typographic elements to explore the intersections of design and politics in three dimensions. In this, her first major printmaking project, Floyd returns words and text to paper to highlight the shared utopian ideals and experimental nature of the period.

The series of nine aquatints, which was completed under a fellowship with the Australian Print Workshop, reinvigorates the left wing and alternative tradition of radical printmaking in Australia, which peaked in the late 1970s and early 80s.

It’s Time (Again) quotes the seminal ‘It’s Time’ election speech by the opposition leader Gough Whitlam, who became Prime Minister in 1972. Floyd turns Whitlam’s words into a concrete poem of concentric circles of text, like the groove lines of a vinyl record. Replayed as a poster, Floyd suggests their message is still worth hearing. Other works in the series, such as A Little Community, condense the words of feminist and academic Germaine Greer, sculpting excerpts from her landmark book, The Female Eunuch, (1970) into the shape of the female Venus symbol. In A bird like that never dies, the words of Indigenous actor David Gulpilill from the 1976 movie Storm Boy are formatted in the design of the Aboriginal flag, designed in 1971.

In her depiction of these groundbreaking and formative texts, Floyd revisits a specific political history of activism and dissent, when left-wing policies, the feminist movement and the fight for aboriginal rights fundamentally reoriented Australian society and culture.",It's time (again),,,,,,,,,,,,,
Earthworks Poster Collectove,"These striking screen-prints are a pithy visual summary of almost a century of feminist campaigning in Australia. In the first, late nineteenth-century suffragists pose in the act of making agitational graffiti: ‘Votes for Women’. Their sober dress contrasts nicely with the incitation to political change. The second image, from 1977, shows Sydney feminists recreating the suffragists’ pose, this time calling for participation in a Women’s March for Liberation. Toni Robertson’s use of photographs in her prints underscores her commitment to historical knowledge, as well as to political change. In both cases these are actual women: the earlier struggles for women’s suffrage, and later for equal rights, were real and urgent.

The continuities between the two periods are crucial:  feminist historian Anne Summers unearthed the earlier photograph in the 1970s, while researching Australian feminism, and today Robertson remembers these discoveries were precious evidence of Australian women’s history of commitment and achievement. While both photographs were staged, Robertson interpreted them differently through the multiple colours and layers of printing ink: the suffragists are pictured with a black and sepia palette speaking to times past, while the 1970s is seen through delicate greys suggesting straightforward documentary. What links the two images across the century is the boldly written red text across the bottom of each, clearly handmade, entirely passionate.

Toni Robertson came to screen-printing while studying art history at the University of Sydney, seeing posters and prints as tools for feminism. Importantly, she participated in the 1973 strike prompted by the refusal of the University’s Philosophy Department to introduce a course on ‘Philosophical aspects of feminist thought’. The University eventually bowed to student and staff pressure, and the course was introduced from 1974. Toni Robertson continued her distinguished work with political postering and printmaking for another decade.",History I,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Emily Floyd,"Turning with the flow of air, Emily Floyd’s suspended Garden Sculpture owes its twisted ladder construction to both garden wind decorations and the molecular composition of DNA – the organic code that carries the instructions for life. The tenuous connection between these two otherwise unrelated forms is made concrete when the individual rungs of Floyd’s helix are examined. Each of the Beech rods spiraling out from the centre is inscribed with the URL of a website, blog or do-it-yourself forum used by Floyd as she researched permaculture and environmental activism in Australia. The work functions as a research map of Floyd’s interest in grassroots political movements and the role of collective action, embodying the internet’s role in facilitating self-initiated learning.

Floyd’s previous works have considered the relationship between politics and design, and the relationship between global political movements, such as Marxism, feminism and environmentalism and the local forms and actions they take. Floyd is the daughter and granddaughter of wooden toy makers, and her spare, simple and undecorated construction echoes the educational toys of the Bauhaus and Steiner schools, which sought to improve the lives of children and the role of teachers through good design and an educational philosophy of organic play and unstructured investigation.

In Garden Sculpture Floyd suggests that, like a communal garden, the internet can be a space of collaborative enterprise for a common good. When people come together in online forums and blogs to share a resource, to cultivate an idea or benefit from another’s experience, they contribute to an expanding knowledge base that Floyd sees as an essentially positive force. Each rung in the spiral constitutes a body of information, opinion and action, which together comprise a collective knowledge that, like a garden, will grow, take root and spread or, left untended, will wither and die.",Garden Sculpture,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Fiona Foley ,"The three sepia-toned photographs in Fiona Foley’s Badtjala Woman series are based on colonial images of Badtjala people, whose country includes Thoorgine or K’gari (Fraser Island), taken by an ethnographic photographer in around 1899. The images are held in the John Oxley Library in Brisbane, and were used by Foley in an earlier installation, Lost Badtjalas – Severed Hair (1991).

For Badtjala Woman, Foley has replicated the head and shoulders composition of ethnographic photography, which aimed to record its subject not as an individual but a type; a subject whose exotic features and behaviour could be scientifically catalogued. She has also included the woven bag and necklaces that were collected by ethnographers as records of Indigenous material cultures, and which were important products of women’s work.
Nakedness was often demanded by ethnographic photographers, who asked their subjects to undress in order to conform to an idea of what an ‘authentic’ Indigenous person looked like. These images were then sometimes circulated for non-scientific purposes as exotica, in the manner of Paul Gauguin’s island Venuses − a western imagining of the mythical sexuality of ‘black’ women.
Foley critiques the operation of colonial power disseminated through this kind of imagery by taking it over – directing the shoot and posing for the photographs herself. In doing so, she overturns the anonymity and subjugation of the original subjects and aligns herself with them as their descendant, a contemporary Badtjala woman in control of her own identity and image.",Badtjala woman,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Fiona Foley ,"Bliss was filmed at an opium farm in Tasmania, the camera slowly panning across an endless field of silvery, shimmering poppies gently moving in the breeze. The quietly contemplative framing is interspersed with text from the 1897 Aboriginals Protection and Restriction of the Sale of Opium Act. This legislation, enacted by the Queensland Parliament, had two main aims – to criminalise the supply of opium to Aboriginal people (the principal purveyors of which were considered to be Chinese traders), and to ‘protect’ Aboriginal people from substance addiction by forcing them onto reserves under the guardianship of government-appointed Protectors of Aborigines. The Act controlled the lives of Aboriginal people by significantly restricting their autonomy and freedom to live, work and marry as they chose, and worsened the already troubled relations between white, Asian and Indigenous peoples in Queensland. Fiona Foley has used the 1897 Act and its impact in a number of works, of which Bliss is one.

A sense of opium’s hypnotic effects is suggested by the rustling sounds and movement of poppy heads swaying on their stems, interspersed with short quotes from Dr Rosalind Kidd’s 1997 book The Way We Civilise: Aboriginal Affairs – The Untold Story. This forensic archival study examines the disastrous consequences of benevolently intentioned projects that sought to ‘reform’ Indigenous Australians from 1897 to 1981. Bliss’s vivid and dynamic footage of Tasmanian poppies grown for medical purposes provokes contemplation on the nature of the ‘fix’ that addictive substances offer to individual and social conflicts.",Bliss,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Nicholas Folland,"In The Door Was Open… a ball of ice gradually encrusts a chandelier, its glacial encroachment threatening to short out its branching filaments of light. The crystalline structure of the ice is mimicked in the cut-glass lustres which hang from it like icicles, making the graft between chandelier and freezer seem perfectly natural – two domestic appliances ‘at home’ with one another.

Powered by both electricity and a concealed refrigeration unit, The Door Was Open… is a poetic musing on humanity’s conflicted relationship to nature and natural forces and resources. Our dependence on electric lights, fridges and air-conditioners moderate our environments to make them more livable, even as their carbon emissions change weather patterns and make them more indispensible. In a reverse of global warming, it is the advance, rather than the retreat, of ice which will here engulf the fitting and short the lights. Glacial growth rather than melt threatens the existence of this chandelier, but the heat of the lights promises an effective check on the enveloping ice, suggesting that in this pairing of the elements there is at least a self-perpetuating equilibrium. Whether the ice grows on the chandelier like a parasite, or the chandelier grows out of the ice like a vine from its host, there is an intimation here of a beautiful and finely calibrated ecosystem hanging in the balance between the natural and the manmade.",The Door Was Open,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Nicole Forshew,"A Wiradjuri woman from central-western NSW, Nicole Foreshew explores the relationship between the body and the earth in artworks that consider concepts of time, materiality, growth and renewal. Country and culture play a significant role across the artist’s multi-disciplinary practice, which encompasses photography, sculpture, textiles and video. The artist draws on personal, familial and cultural relations to place, referencing the deep connection that has developed between people and the environment over generations. Working with processes of observation, listening and enacting, Foreshew documents the transformation of the land or creates situations in which the subtle, often invisible, actions of the earth are made visible.  

Recently the artist has created a series of ephemeral artworks that ‘awaken places of memory beyond the temporality of ruins’.[1] Working primarily with installation, sculpture and performance at sites of personal, familial and cultural significance, Foreshew then records these temporal actions using a range of mediums including photography and video. In works such as Cultural Drift (2016), Foreshew reflects on her relationship with Country and ‘its associated histories, commodities and lifecycles’. 
Cultural Drift is a single-channel video that depicts a large object wrapped in fabric on the shoreline of a secluded beach. A constant breeze ripples the material giving the appearance of a lifeform – emerging and rising, swelling and surging.  Surrounding the swathed object are shallow pools of water that shimmer in the sunlight, while in the distance large wave crashes against the rocks. Sound and colour play a key role in creating a sensory experience of place in the work. The muted sepia colour palette of the video accentuates the textures and forms of the site, highlighting the refined patterns and understated materials of the land. While the accompanying soundtrack weaves together field recordings of seagulls, howling wind and breaking waves alongside an electronic composition. Over the course of the video the sounds of nature morph into an evocative soundscape and back again.",Cultural Drift,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Nicole Forshew,"In ngayirr (sacred) (2015–17) Foreshew brings together an ‘awareness of place together with cultural knowledge of earth, mineral and plant materials’.[1] ngayirr (sacred) comprises of nine tree limbs found by the artist on Country that have been ceremoniously transformed.  The head or tip of each limb is covered in a crystalline skin that range in colour from pale pink to deep russet.  Installed leaning against the gallery wall, the individual branches evoke bodily forms.  Foreshew intentionally buried the limbs underground in a site of personal significance. Over time a crystalline skin grows across the limb, the result of a chemical reaction deep with the earth. Referencing spiritual and cultural practices of the artist’s homeland, ngayirr (sacred) traces ‘personal connections to kin and the material knowledge required to retrieve and revive the body’",ngayirr (sacred),,,,,,,,,,,,,
Hayden Fowler,"In White Australia we see two holes cut into a tiled, claustrophobic corner of what could be a bathroom, laboratory or clinic. An overlay of droning, discordant sound seeps from the space, creating an atmosphere of industrialised torpor. Every few seconds a white rat scuttles out of a hole and across the space – a hypnotic action repeated over and over by other rats throughout the video’s 23-minute loop. Their repetitious movement is a response to what Hayden Fowler considered to be the dangerously apathetic nature of dominant Australian society during the years of the Howard government (1996–2007). Inspired by the unthinking mass movements of 9 to 5 commuters at a busy train station, the artist presents his rats as creatures caught in a system of power over which they have little control.

Fowler originally trained as a biologist, and his work – for which he builds sets and trains animals himself – investigates our problematic interactions with the natural world. He is interested in the nexus between civilisation and the domestication of animals, focusing on aspects such as interdependency and adaptation. Rats have been the companions of mankind, for good or ill, for millennia. The white rats of the laboratory and the clinical trial have been a mainstay of medical science, allowing us to manipulate nature to overcome disease and extend life spans. The rat has also been a cultural mainstay – a metaphor of individual cleverness and cunning, but also of group compliance, a runner in a rat race of pointless pursuit.",White Australia,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Dale Frank,"Dale Frank’s work Every time I glance it’s just not me evokes the performance of painting and the process of experiencing the work. Lollypop-pink varnish slides down a mirrored surface in which the viewers can see a distorted image of themself. Frank’s paintings inspire numerous interpretations, from dreamscapes to the enormity of the universe, from the psychology of the inner world to the profundity of vast landscapes and the cosmos. All of these interpretations and more are reflected in the surface of the varnish, in the gooey reflective viscosity of Frank’s artistic vision.

Experimenting with the drip and flow of different paints and varnishes on different surfaces, Frank’s paintings evolve slowly over time. The different reactions of different paints to the linen, cotton, fibreglass or – as in Every time I glance it’s just not me – anodised plexiglass surface, create works that change as they dry. Drips formed by gravity pool and harden while colours wash into one another in layers and stratifications. Although Frank moves paint with calculated precision across the picture plane, his paintings ripple with a visual elasticity and sense of immediacy. Incorporating vivid and startling colour, the paintings are layered with a sense of three-dimensionality that can appear as deep voids of blackness and as translucent veils of sparkling light.",Everytime I Glance,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sally Gabori,"Using a layered four-colour palette Sally Gabori depicts Makarrki, or King Alfred’s country, on Bentinck Island. A warrior and leader, King Alfred was Gabori’s brother. His site on Bentinck Island, Gabori says, ‘is a very special place … [with] a big river that runs through it … This is where dugong and turtles come on a high tide … making it easy for the men to catch them.’

Although Gabori relocated to Mornington Island in the 1940s, she spent the first few decades of her long life on Bentinck Island, the island of her birth. The largest of the Wellesley Islands in the Gulf of Carpentaria, Bentinck Island is low-lying, with its highest point a 10-metre-tall sandhill. While saltpans mark the interior of the island, casuarinas sprout along its coastal sands and mangroves populate its tidal flats. Further fringing the island is a complex system of stone fish-traps, assembled in rock and mortared over time by oyster shells. With their flat planes of solid colours Gabori’s paintings bring to mind these discrete yet interdependent zones, while the combination of colours speaks to the way in which the artist envisages her interaction with these places.

Gabori resided on Mornington Island for the remainder of her long life, but her connection to Bentinck Island life and culture was innate, and her success as an artist enabled her to return to country. Her artworks speak volumes about the enjoyment she received from painting; her works ‘are a celebration of her homeland and illustrate a deep connection to country that has not diminished through physical separation.’[2] Through her use of colour and form, Gabori creates reveries of country, of story, of her memories and family, that are at once joyous and bittersweet.",Makarrki,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Rosalie Gascoigne,"Tiger Tiger is a well-known work made from reflective road signs that flash and flare when they catch the light. Cut up and reassembled in a grid, the clear directional language of the original signs is fragmented, the letters are scattered and their meaning incomprehensible. The real meaning of the work lies in the experience of the found, weathered and reconfigured material and the play of light upon it.

Although the letters across the surface of Tiger Tiger do not cohere, language is central to its layered play of meaning. Gascoigne’s early training was in literature rather than the visual arts, and language infuses her work. Her assemblages are frequently referred to as visual poetry and share with modern poetry the construction techniques of fragmentation, repetition and juxtaposition. She often commented that her collaged use of text in works forms a sort of ‘stammering concrete poetry’.

Gascoigne’s titles are always significant and she named this work after English poet William Blake’s 1794 rumination on the beauty and horror of nature, The Tyger. She frequently referred to Tiger Tiger in order to explain how a title would come to her in contemplation, following the completion of a work (see Artist Statement). If the visual effects of Gascoigne’s works are open-ended and experiential, the titles reflect formal qualities that are evocative, personal and precise – providing a point of entry into the work without being prescriptive. Just as Blake’s description of the animal begins, ‘Tyger tyger burning bright’, Gascoigne’s title points to the bold yellow and black colouring and its bright reflection. Similarly, the repetition in the title Tiger Tiger mirrors the two square panels of the diptych and the regular grid evokes the ordered patternation of the animal’s pelt, like Blake’s ‘fearful symmetry’.",Tiger Tiger,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Teelah George,"Sky Piece is a work of slow, labour-intensive embroidery in which a patchwork of natural-coloured linen offcuts (left over from canvases used by the artist for her paintings) are joined together by a huge number of imperfect stitches in varying shades of blue. Together, these elements capture the artist’s impression of the vibrant and expansive Western Australian sky. Each palm-sized section of fabric took the artist about an hour to complete, and their variations in hue, stitch-length and direction build up not only a saturation of colour but a map of time – a geography of laborious effort that is at odds with the time-poor, automated society in which it was produced. 

Teelah George stitched Sky Piece while listening to the oral history of an 80-year-old woman, Althea Dorris Barber, outlining her memories of life in Western Australia during the early 20th century. Sky Piece weaves together a kind of women’s history in its interaction with an archive such as this. Although invisible in the piece, the memories of women’s work – of sewing clothes, quilts and curtains – are present in the very nature of George’s own labour. The patched materiality of Sky Piece recalls the ‘waggas’, or handmade blankets, made from old chaff bags by women in rural Australia during the first half of the 20th century. Work like this was often done to the accompaniment of other women’s voices as they talked over the shared task of quilting or patchworking. The sewing bee (still referred to today as a ‘stitch-and-bitch’) was a conduit for stories, wisdom and guidance shared within and between generations, encompassing histories and narratives that have not been recorded or preserved.

Some of these quilts – like the oral history that was the soundtrack to the making of Sky Piece – are now housed in national archives and collections. In Sky Piece George threads the immaterial voice and the material fabric together in an obsessive and repetitive task that speaks to the constant labour of what has been regarded as ‘women’s work’. Using the physicality of the action of stitching and the tangibility of its effects, George creates a work of pure colour that emanates from the materiality of thread and testifies to the work of women in generations past.",Sky Piece,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Matthys Gerber,"Matthys Gerber’s Jetmaster (2008) is a classic example of the large-scale abstract Rorschach paintings he has been making since the mid-1990s. Drawing on the inkblot test developed by Swiss psychiatrist Hermann Rorschach in the 1920s, Gerber creates these paintings by pouring paint onto an unstretched canvas, which is then folded in half and then back on itself in various directions to create a multi-coloured abstract ground. He then goes back and paints over sections of the work, modifying and rectifying the imprints created through the initial folding.

Gerber’s evocative titling, along with the use of the Rorschach method to create these works, produce abstract paintings that play with the tensions between the contradictory painting techniques of abstraction and representation. In these paintings, Gerber’s interest in mirroring and the replication of forms is explored, along with the collision of the spontaneous and gestural with the deliberate and stylised. Their horizontal orientation is a deliberate deviation from the conventional presentation of Rorschach tests, which are usually shown on a vertical axis. In this, Gerber was guided by Indigenous paintings, in which the painting’s orientation is proscribed in accordance with the topographical features it represents.

The Rorschach patterning in Jetmaster recalls the decorative design of the fleur-de-lis, which is based on the lily or lotus flower. As a sign and symbol, which is both an abstract pattern and a figurative representation, the fleur-de-lis succinctly illustrates the mirroring and doubling at the heart of Gerber’s painting quest, where the concepts of repetition, speed and variation, as found in music, are mimicked in the folding, opening and painterly aspects of the works.",Jetmaster,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Matthys Gerber,"At first glance Matthys Gerber’s Painting for Peter (2003) sits firmly within the tradition of hard edge geometric abstraction. However, as with much of Gerber’s work, there are multiple references at play. The story of Painting for Peter is deeply rooted in the personal – a homage to his friend and fellow artist Peter Tyndall.

Gerber and Tyndall first became acquainted in the mid-1980s when exhibiting at the Sydney gallery Yuill|Crowley. During their ensuing friendship, Tyndall sent Gerber a hand-painted Christmas card featuring Tyndall’s signature square motif, repeated and on the diagonal in black-and-white.[1] Years later, noticing that moisture had affected a corner of the card, Gerber decided to ‘save’ it by colouring it in. The colours he chose came from a remnant of flamboyantly coloured Victorian wallpaper that he found in a derelict house years before. He translated the colours into a repetitive pattern based on Tyndall’s design. Gerber has said of this moment: ‘I liked the association with Peter’s work of creating wallpaper, something I had already done and Peter’s work also suggested.’[2] It was this now collaborative work on paper that Gerber adapted into the large canvas Painting for Peter.

Passed from one artist to the other and back again, evolving with each step, Painting for Peter exemplifies Gerber’s experimental approach to art-making and his willingness to draw from any source, be it high art, the decorative or the domestic.  This re-presentation of other artists’ work, whether subtle or overt, is a feature of Gerber’s oeuvre. In Painting for Peter, he pays homage to the creativity of Tyndall and demonstrates, boldly and playfully, the self-reflexivity and critical importance of art history to his creative process.",Painting for Peter,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Kevin Gilbert,"This lino print, by the poet, artist and activist Kevin Gilbert, depicts Wiradjuri subjects, stories and heroes. It was made when the artist was in prison from 1965 using the most basic materials: lino taken from the floor and cutting tools fashioned from a used spoon, a fork, gem blades and nails. Gilbert printed the images using the back of a spoon to rub and transfer the ink onto paper. He made a conscious decision to exhibit his prints in a gallery context in 1971, when his artworks were first exhibited at an Australia Council exhibition at the Arts Council gallery. In doing so, these works are widely regarded as being the first by an Aboriginal printmaker.

The first print made in the series is My Father’s Studio, in which Gilbert wanted to show ‘the natural pride and completeness of the Aboriginal artist, the cave, the art, the landscape’. A similar desire informed Corroboree Spirit, which depicts an Aboriginal group who are not only part of the landscape but inseparable from it. Gilbert’s use of his Wiradjuri language in the titles of some of these artworks was a conscious act of cultural affirmation. More generally it provides a deeper understanding and context of not only the Aboriginal experience of artist as historian, social commentator and agitator for change but also forms the basis of the articulate way he has threaded this powerful perspective throughout the development of his poetry, essays, playwriting, photography and award-winning literature. Apart from being the first Aboriginal printmaker, Gilbert was also the first Aboriginal playwright to have his work staged by an all-Aboriginal cast with The Cherry Pickers (1968). Whether through art, literature or political activism, Gilbert aimed to ‘expound on the Aboriginal situation by whatever way, through art or whatever form.",Totality,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Simryn Gill,"The three works of Caress are the traces of typewriters – made by placing sheets of paper over the machines and rubbing them with graphite.  These works are part of a wider series of seven typewriter rubbings made from vintage typewriters that the artist has collected over time – an Olivetti Studio 46, a Lemain Deluxe 850 TR and an Underwood Universal – all superseded by the advent of electric models and then computer technology. The typewriter is a hand-operated machine for making ink notations on paper: an active, and in some hands, expressive tool. Here, Gill has made the machine passive – the marks on paper are of the machine rather than by the machine. The rubbings are like death masks of each typewriter, a final tribute to their passing in the electronic age.

Gill has a diverse art practice, including making photographs, sculptures and collections, and writing and drawing. She is interested in ideas of obsolescence – the archaic idea of the typewriter which has been replaced by the computer today; and the typewritten page itself, which is superseded by current printing technology and liable to literally fade with time. In other works she has documented landscapes and dwellings that are in states of decline and decay.",Caress,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Shaun Gladwell,"In Tangara, Shaun Gladwell uses the architecture and fittings of a public train as a gymnast uses the rings and bars of a gymnasium. As he grips the rails in a carriage vestibule, Gladwell performs a slow-motion sequence of graceful strength. Outside, the lights of night-dark stations pass by the windows like meteors and comets, as if the train was hurtling through space rather than the suburbs of Sydney. Inside, the fluorescent lighting and hard, glossy surfaces of the Tangara-class train echo the clinical architecture of a space shuttle. Tangara is shot upside-down and in slow motion, creating an inverted and otherworldly effect that turns the train’s vestibule into an anti-gravity chamber, with Gladwell a floating astronaut tethered above the carriage’s central grabrail. The length of his torso and the span of his outstretched arms and legs define the circuit of his choreography within the space, which he moves through without letting hands or feet touch the ground.

Gladwell takes the restless energy of youth, and the urban spaces in which it is exercised, and turns them into a graceful performance of his physicality. In other works, Gladwell has used his skill in skateboarding and parkour to explore and expand upon the ways in which bodies interact with, and express themselves through, their environments. In Tangara, the graceful display of stamina and duration in motion disrupts the conformist behaviours of commuting and the utilitarianism of the train carriage by transforming it into a playground.",Tangara,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Simryn Gill,"Untitled (Interior) II is a bronze casting of a crack that formed in the ground during a long drought. The work is a unique edition from a series of five castings that were made in locations near Nyngan in western New South Wales and Lake George, just outside Canberra. These works were cast in bronze by Apisit Nongbua, a Thai sculptor who works in traditional bronze techniques.

Untitled (Interior) II documents a void that is both ephemeral and in flux. The sculpture suggests something that is invisible or intangible but loaded with a range of shifting meanings – in this case the negative space of a crack in the earth. These cracks, desiccated by drought and preserved in bronze by Gill will, in time, be filled by water, mud and dirt. This idea of the passage of time, of states of transformation and change, are recurring themes in Gill’s work, as is her focus on found or overlooked objects. In Untitled (Interior) II she records a transient state, a symptom of the climate and a rupture in the earth that will continue to change over time as it shifts from dry to wet, infertile to fertile. In other works, using photography and carbon rubbings, Gill has created similar transcriptions of objects and states of being manifesting decline or decay, and the impact of the natural environment on the built world. The bronze cast creates another kind of analogue transcription which makes permanent that which we presume to be in a state of flux. In using a traditional sculptural material such as bronze, and working with a craftsperson whose family has been making bronze Buddhas for temples and the Thai royal family for generations, Gill draws on a range of art historical and cultural references. As Russell Storer writes, ‘Gill’s work takes up a questioning, playful mode that collapses together multiple histories – personal, local and art-historical.",Untitled (interior),,,,,,,,,,,,,
