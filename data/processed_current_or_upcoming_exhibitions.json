    "description": "AES+F is best known for its unique aesthetic sense, which combines historical and mythical references with the contemporary imagery of urban landscapes. In its collaborative, ambitious projects, AES+F uses sets of references, rather than individual ones, drawn from the worlds of architecture, fashion and design. These created environments and spaces are elevated to become characters in the narrative. Generating symbolic compositions in which every element has been carefully planned within a broader, sophisticated narrative, the collective delicately orchestrates scenes where familiar elements become estranged.\nThe plot of \"Inverso Mundus\", a 38-minute film, is inspired on the genre of World Upside Down engravings, known for satirically depicting surreal scenes in which the natural order of the world, including social roles, were inverted. Widely circulated in Europe since the 16th century, these prints used a series of brief vignettes, where animals are riding people and slaves are served by their masters, among others, as a way of critiquing social order.\nReminiscent of the medieval tradition of carnivals rooted in the Saturnalia -- an ancient Roman festival dedicated to Saturn -- the World Upside Down engravings, allowed a space for social commentary, but also, they became a place for artistic potential where a contradictory world could emerge. Such style, brought into fine arts with painting masters like Hieronymous Bosch and Goya endorsed compositions with a unique poetic sense where the absurd and grotesque create a new kind of aesthetic vision. In the same manner, AES+F offers through \"Inverso Mundus\" a reinterpretation of contemporary life, a \"light hearted contemporary apocalypse.\"\nAdapted for the Experimental Gallery at the SCAD Museum of Art as a pan-optic experience and accompanied by a vigorous classical soundtrack, the film is comprised of sequential vignettes. These vignettes feature scenes such as the board of a corporation being overthrown by a group of common people hybrid creatures flying by the skyline of an advanced city; a butcher being slaughtered by a swine; a group of luxuriously dressed women capturing and dominating a group of men; and youngsters physically battling a group of elders, among other equally complex scenes. As a unifying characteristic, the beautiful, statuesque characters presented in the film conduct themselves with dead-pan expression, as well as with particularly cautious movements. Somehow, the interaction between them seems unfinished, more circumstantial than intentional, imbuing each scene with an uncanny atmosphere.\nRelying on the power of imagination and critique as a potential site for change, AES+F beautifully questions the validity of social roles of power and subordination, while providing the viewer a potent, immersive audiovisual experience."

    "description": "Contemporary photography from the Schaufler Collection will be on display from September 2017 at the SCHAUWERK Sindelfingen. The museum will link this show to the LICHTEMPFINDLICH exhibition of 2011, which had presented the large collection of this medium to the public for the first time in the impressive space of the former high rack warehouse in the SCHAUWERK. This lofty storage space inspires with its revolving ramp, which extends over 15 metres upward: an exhibition place par excellence for photography, with spectacular visual axes for viewing from near and afar.\nAlong with major works from the first exhibition, LICHTEMPFINDLICH 2 will also display photographs that previously haven't been shown, so that a more comprehensive representation of the contemporary photography collection can occur. The main interest of the collectors Peter Schaufler and Christiane Schaufler-Munch is not directed toward the medium and its history per se, but leans more toward the fascination that arises from certain motifs, pictorial inventions, and their formal transformations.\nThe classic genres of photography--nude, portrait, landscape, architecture, or industry--are mirrored in the works, but are often citations or stages of conceptual processes. Most of the protagonists within the context of this collection have left behind the conventional framework of photography."

    "description": "Objects Like Us, a group exhibition featuring nearly seventy tabletop art objects by more than fifty artists, will open at The Aldrich Contemporary Art Museum in May. This exhibition explores the relational behavior of intimately scaled objects that personify or embody a human condition or attribute. The objects will span nearly sixty years and feature works conceived specifically for the exhibition, including a site-specific floor installation by artist/co-curator David Adamo. The overall experience will underscore the efficacy of the works' relativity and illuminate the interconnectedness of audience and objects. Objects Like Us, is organized by Amy Smith-Stewart, curator at The Aldrich, and Adamo; it will be on view at The Aldrich from May 20, 2018, to January 13, 2019.\nSmall objects of symbolic prominence exert a special hold. Some purport to possess healing powers, channel spirit gods, or speak to us; others perform for us, mime our mannerisms, or impart notable narratives. Even with the dramatic dematerialization of objects in this hyperkinetic moment, tangible objects of small stature and symptomatic value command sizeable importance in our everyday lives, as they have for tens of thousands of years. We obsessively cram our homes, offices, museums, and galleries with these diminutive objects--whether objects of art, historical worth, ceremony, or of individual accomplishment, all are expressions of us, and thus of broader culture.\nIn Objects Like Us each work affects or exposes a circumstance, attribute, or manner that is notably human and transmits a potentiality, aura, or agency demonstrative of being. This exhibition brings together art objects that not only parrot human behavior or gestures, but that unequivocally \"interrelate.\" It has been conjured as a performative arrangement, with the objects installed in an intentional frontal method of display, positioned on a long shelf that extends over three walls of a rectilinear gallery. Its design combines two common yet neutralized display formats, the table and the shelf, suspending the visitor within a situation that evokes both the home and the museum. Another distinguishing feature of this exhibition is co-curator and artist David Adamo's (b. 1979) eleven-hundred-square-foot, site-specific floor installation, Batons Rompus (2012), comprised entirely of rectangular sticks of white school chalk laid out in a herringbone pattern that mimics vintage parquet. Like all ephemeral works, its vulnerability will be apparent as the chalk inescapably succumbs to day-to-day wear and tear, fracturing and eventually disintegrating under the scores of shuffling feet, enhancing the visitor's sensitivity to site and context while tracking their introspective travels within the gallery.",

    "description": "MISA SHIN GALLERY is pleased to announce McDonald's Radio University, a solo exhibition by Takayama Akira, from Friday, November 23, 2018 to Saturday, January 19, 2019.\nBorn in 1969, Takayama Akira is a theater director and artist who embraces a broad range of non-conventional performance methods in a bid to expand the concept of theater within contemporary society. They include installations, touring performances, social experimentation projects, discourse events, sightseeing tours, videos, and many other approaches.\nMcDonald's Radio University is a project that transforms branches of McDonald's restaurant across a city into lecture spaces, creating a citywide university. The professors are immigrants or refugees who have had to leave their home countries, and the students are people who walk into a McDonald's and order a lecture along with a burger and a coke.\nThe project was premiered in 2017 across seven McDonald's stores in Frankfurt, Germany. The professors stationed in each of the stores delivered their lectures via lapel mics, ransmitting throughout the store. Students used portable radios and earphones distributed at the counter to tune into their lectures in real time. The professors in Frankfurt were all refugees, coming from countries such as Afghanistan, Syria, Pakistan, Ghana, and Iran, and speaking on a total of fifteen topics encompassing philosophy, music, architecture, biology, natural science, and journalism.\nThe fast food restaurant McDonald's is renowned as a symbol of global capitalism, and has gained a reputation for serving up unhealthy junk food. Yet in Europe, where class divides and other social divisions are becoming impossible to ignore, it is also a place that welcomes immigrants and refugees as both customers and staff, and a location where many ethnicities, races, religions and ages of people coexist. By taking McDonald's as his setting, Takayama unveils deception that art criticizes social problems from on high, designing his project as a shifting device that can enable us to learn from the world as it really is.\nThe McDonald's Radio University at MISA SHIN GALLERY takes place not in an actual McDonald's restaurant, but in a re-creation of one. The professors are people who participate as Tokyo tour guides in Takayama's New Tokyo School Excursion Project: Japanese Orphans in China Edition. They are some of the people who, as children, had been left behind in China when their Japanese families were repatriated at the end of the Second World War. Adopted by local families and growing up in China, many faced discrimination after moving to Japan. In addition to this line-up, there will be ten lectures selected from the twenty-five delivered in Frankfurt and Berlin. The exhibition opens on a public holiday, Friday November 23rd, and exhibition visitors will be able to hear the professors speaking live on that first day.\nTakayama Akira\nBorn in 1969. In 2002, he formed the theater company Port B, and since then has been producing installations, touring performances and social experiments utilizing urban spaces as a way of engaging with cities and societies across the world. In recent years, collaboration with those from other fields including visual art, tourism, literature, architecture, and urban researches has seen the scope of his practice broadening further, and he has applied his theatrical philosophy and methodology to opening up new possibilities in a variety of fields. Major works include the Our Songs-Sydney Kabuki Project (Sydney), the Wagner Project (Yokohama), McDonald's Radio University (Frankfurt, Berlin), Tokyo/Heterotopia (Tokyo), Piraeus/Heterotopia (Athens), Beitou/Heterotopia (Taipei), Beirut/Heterotopia (Beirut), Yokohama Commune (Yokohama), Compartment City - Vienna (Vienna), Referendum Project (Tokyo, Fukushima, etc.), and The Complete Manual of Evacuation (Tokyo, Frankfurt). He has participated in major exhibitions, such as Yokohama Triennale (2014), Maison Hermes (2015, Tokyo), Roppongi Crossing (2016, Mori Art Museum, Tokyo), Sharjah Biennial (2017), and Biennale of Sydney (2018). He is an associate professor at the Graduate School of Film and New Media, Tokyo University of the Arts.",

    "description": "In popular culture the \"Echo Chamber\" is a moniker for circuitous news media and its attendant feeds that are reinforced by a closed system, a network that is controlled and governed by private sources, governments and corporations. It is also a metaphor for the historical dominance of Capital and the cultural, social and political systems which dictate its access, production and distribution - this 'capital' wooing (and thus privileging) particular image, language, skill, history and geography. Most tangibly, the 'Echo Chamber' is the space wherein sound hits and reverberates, where memory and imagination echo across surface, across space, and across time. \n'Leaving the Echo Chamber' does not propose a \"how\" to \"leave\" this context, but rather seeks to put into conversation a series of provocations on how one might re-negotiate the shape, form and function of this chamber, towards a multiplying of the echoes within, such vibration representative of the vast forms of human production -- its rituals, beliefs and customs. The 14th Sharjah Biennial begs the viewer to consider: What does it mean to demand alternate images at a time when news saturation is spoon-fed to us by a monopoly of sources? How do we expand our narratives by acknowledging what has been hidden or removed? Moreover, how can we reflect on our own culturally located histories in an era whereby so many individuals have been forced to believe that they must surrender their own agency to the mainstream forces that exist and govern our world?\nThe echo chamber here could be construed as a modern day Faraday cage - an enclosure that covers conductive material, which prevents transmitting signals. Except here, artists are given the agency to tell stories that echo in a different way, thus creating new surfaces for a multiplicity of chambers revealing differing means of connecting, surviving and sustaining a collective humanity.",

It is an exceptionally strong cohort of artists, all of whom are making diverse and challenging work. The artists represented this year individually and collectively contribute to a critical understanding and discourse around an expanded view of contemporary art and the question of artâs context in the world today, and I am confident their work will find a receptive audience in Belfast.â\nAnne Barlow said âI am thrilled to be part of the jury for this significant prize for contemporary art. Since its inception in 2014, MAC International has made a vital contribution to the visual arts in Belfast and beyond, offering opportunities for artists from around the world to present both existing and new work to the public. It has been wonderful to see the breadth and quality of applications for this 2018 edition, and I very much look forward to seeing the work of the shortlisted artists at the MAC in November.â\nBa?ak ?enova said: âMAC International is an important measure of the current state of contemporary art production around the world. The quality of work submitted this year was outstanding and the process of selecting the artists to take part in the exhibition, alongside my fellow jurors Hugh Mulholland and Anne Barlow, has been a wonderful experience. It has been inspiring to see the quality and criticality demonstrated in the eleven selected projects and I am very excited to see the resulting exhibition in November.",

    "description": "Art history is often neatly told through the touchstones of individual artists and stylistic movements. West by Midwest tells a messier story of contemporary art--one that illuminates the ways that contemporary art practices spread and develop by tracing the intersecting lives of artists who have migrated from the American Midwest to the West Coast since the mid-20th century. Lured by career opportunities, warmer weather, and the prospect of a better life promised by the postwar boom, those artists who were able to migrate attended art schools together, shared studios, exhibited work in the same galleries, collaborated on projects, engaged in activism, and dated. Following these crisscrossing lines of kinship, West by Midwest reveals a network of artists and their shared experiences of making work and making a life.\nDivided into six sections, West by Midwest presents more than 80 artworks in a wide variety of media, made by some 63 artists from the 1960s through the 2010s. Each section maps three overlapping forms of kinship: practice, or the ways that artists make and approach their work; place, or the spaces where artists congregate and exchange ideas; and people, or the manifold human relationships that compose artists' personal and professional circles. This story of contemporary art's spread from the Midwest to the West Coast focuses on formal, material, and historical affinities among these artists, disrupting the mythic solo journey to the western frontier founded on an aspirational ethos of American individualism and independence. Anchored by works in the MCA's collection, West by Midwest eschews a definitive survey of individuals' achievements to instead consider how artists move and make work within a larger field of relations.\nWest by Midwest is organized by Charlotte Ickes, Andrew W. Mellon Postdoctoral Curatorial Fellow. An extensive microsite accompanies the exhibition. It is presented in the Griffin Galleries of Contemporary Art.",

    "description": "This Land focuses on work made throughout the United States within the past decade. The photographers assembled here examine aspects of the country's current social climate, from the mundane to the politicized.\nThe exhibition's title is drawn from Woody Guthrie's song \"This Land Is Your Land\" (1940). Viewed by many as an alternative national anthem, it alludes to the uneasy tensions fundamental to our vision of this nation filled with promise and peril, possibilities and letdowns. At the bottom of the sheet of paper on which Guthrie handwrote the song's lyrics, he noted, \"all you can write is what you see.\" The artists included in this exhibition use cameras rather than pens, creating photographs that speak to what they see in the United States today.\nThe projects on view--created by emerging as well as established photographers--are in-depth studies; some were made over several years and others remain ongoing. While no exhibition can claim to definitively address all aspects of the American experience, This Land offers diverse vignettes of life in the United States. Coinciding with a moment of widespread engagement in political and social issues, the exhibition encourages viewers to look closely and consider how these photographs may complement, contradict, or challenge their understandings of the current social landscape and life in this country. In a world where information sharing is abundant and instantaneous, passive consumption can easily become the norm. The works presented in This Land provide viewers with the opportunity to look, engage, and reflect about the people, places, and conditions shaping the discourse about this nation. Like Guthrie, these artists can impact us, awakening feelings that can transform the present and affect the future.",

    "description": "In her works, Annette Kelm explores the potential of analogue photography to expose the cultural foundations and visual paradoxes of objects through their reproduction. Often her pictures show representations of precise arrangements of things that resemble genres such as still life and studio photography. On the other hand, Kelm's formal imagery imbues the objects with an almost hyperreal presence. Free from any form of narration, emphasis is placed on the compositional moment, which seems to give meaning to the motifs in their visual distinctiveness: everything is what it is, but also receives an abstract, perhaps merely assumed, relevance.\nAnnette Kelm's photographs show simple but at the same time unruly subjects that appear to fit neither in the category of factual documentation nor as symbolic representation. They level things in the picture plane or multiply it in the principle of the series. Often depicted head-on and in great detail, the minimal yet visually quite opulent world of things powerfully emphasize the translation into the two-dimensional space of photography. The narrowing of perspective is both part of the photographic principle and an expression of a highly subjective view.\nCurator: Nicolaus Schafhausen",

    "description": "Are the banal objects of our consumerist world to be equated with the opulently arrayed fruits, blooms and other vanitas motifs familiar to us from the painterly still lifes of Old Masters? What is it that underpins our 400-year fascination with the genre? And why are contemporary artists rediscovering the still life for themselves in the medium of photography at this very precise moment in time? What do still lifes have to say to us today about our habits and our very own existence? \nWith a selection of international and Austrian artists ranging from Jan Groover to Christopher Williams, Leo Kandl and Harun Farocki, the large theme-based photo graphy exhibition highlights the historical development strands that have led to today’s radical re-examination of the genre as a new field of experimentation for artistic expression. Above all, the exhibition featuresa younger generation of artists who are reflecting our very own ‘present’ in their photographs. They do so by precisely perceiving and meticulously examining the world of objects that surrounds us, with all its peculiarities, beauty, and ugliness. While some have chosen aggressively to combine highend consumer products with garbage and trash, others focus on things utterly over looked: worlds of objects that act as the traces of our everyday world with an often idiosyncratic beauty – which is precisely why they\nreward a closer examination. As we slow down the pace with which we contemplate them, these new still lifes counterbalance the glut of digital images that submerge our everyday lives, creating spaces in which our quotidian objects encounter things both novel and unfamiliar.",

On one hand, camps and walls mushroom and confirm the irreversible setback of our hospitality duty, while on the other, citizen involvement grows to help, support and welcome migrants. Is the answer of today's harsh society to bring emergency assistance rather than implement long-term and effective hospitality policies?\nIn this context and from the collections of both museums, this artistic partnership aims at highlighting a contemporary creation that reflects today's world as well as tackling these issues from the point of view of the many artists who have explored the theme of hospitality over the last years.\nThe exhibition will provide a platform for artists to share their analyses, critics and feelings toward national fold, behaviors of rejection and revolt. These artistic testimonies will help us think these questions through and look at ourselves yet without any moralistic judgment.\nThrough this unique and engaged partnership project, the Musee national de l'histoire de l'immigration and the MAC VAL look to raise awareness, foster reflection and debate, and call our certitudes into question. Although central, the issues related to migratory flows do not cross out other neglected -and little known- forms of hospitality toward helpless and weakened populations. The exhibition will bring forth proposals around community life, care for others, the necessity of nursing homes, public health-care and hospitality centers held in a spirit of attentiveness, kindness and sharing we should rehabilitate.",

    "description": "The collective exhibition 'Dancing with Myself' is open at Punta della Dogana from April 8 to December 6, 2018. Curated by Martin Bethenod and Florian Ebner, it stems from the collaboration between the Pinault Collection and the Folkwang Museum in Essen. The exhibition, presented in a first version in 2016 in Essen, proposes a revisited path with over 56 artworks not featured in the German museum.\n'Dancing with Myself' faces the primordial importance of the artist's role as actor and material of his own creations, from the 1970s to today. The exhibition brings together a great range of artistic practices and languages (photography, video, painting, sculpture, installation...), cultures, geographic origins, generations and experiences, to establish a tension between extremely different artistic approaches: melancholy of vanity, ironic play with identity, political biography and existential questioning, the body as sculpture, effigy or fragment of its symbolic substitute.\nApproximately 100 works from the Pinault Collection - from Claude Cahun to LaToya Ruby Frazier, from Gilbert & George to Cindy Sherman, and from Alighiero Boetti to Maurizio Cattelan - are on display alongside a selection of works on loan from the Folkwang Museum. The show is greatly rethought for Punta della Dogana and includes 45 works that did not feature in the version presented in Essen.\nThe exhibition revolves around four themes - Melancholia, Identity Games, Political Autobiographies, Raw Material - that develop evenly through the spaces of Punta della Dogana with 145 works. Over 100 works from the Pinault Collection, of which more than 80 have never been exhibited in Venice, establish a dialogue with a selection of works from the Folkwang Museum in Essen.\nThe exhibition catalogue is in three languages and published by Marsilio, Venezia",

    "description": "The NO Community proposes to address solitude through a polyhedral view from the questioning of the idea of   community, a \"non-community\" characteristic of late capitalist society whose main feature has to do with the idea of   not belonging and breaking the social bond . Through a wide selection of national and international artists, a kind of essay develops around the problem of loneliness at the present time, an analysis that traces its different forms as an epidemic generated from capitalism and its forms of biopolitical separation .\nThe route is not planned in a linear way, but reversible, being able to start from the central cabinet of mirrors and portraits, in which the reflection of the viewer dialogues with a series of portraits and self-portraits of an outstanding selection of artists. From here a series of areas where you can find the consequences of tardiocapitalismo in the form of solitudes, such as the contemporary city, or its counterpoint in the different concepts of periphery that are reflected from the island, space, sea or the consequences derived from the abandonment of the rural. Also the development of technology opens one more chapter to the problem of\nthe loneliness that connects with the section of the ages of solitude, to move on to another of the areas that expands in the idea of   border, explored from all its\nangles: immigration and ideology but also disease, imprisonment, gender and identity.\nIn this way the proposal offers an overview of loneliness: from the most heartbreaking perspective to the most optimistic visions that come especially from the hand of artists who have commissioned ex-professed works for the exhibition, and who in a way or another offer solutions, gestures or alternative views before\nthis problem.",

    "description": "'A World View: The Tim Fairfax Gift' is the story of a deep commitment to contemporary art and to the Queensland Art Gallery | Gallery of Modern Art (QAGOMA). Since 2002, Tim Fairfax AC has supported the acquisition of some of the most remarkable works to have entered the Collection. Reflecting this generosity, this touring exhibition presents works by both renowned and emerging artists, from large-scale artworks to intimate photographic works. The donor's willingness to venture into new collection-building territory, particularly with acquisitions from Africa, South America and the Pacific, is also apparent in the great diversity of works on display.\nArt helps us to channel, refract, activate and recalibrate our understanding of the familiar, to see the world anew. The human body and human experience of the world is at the centre of all of these works. Together, they allow us to develop a richer perspective on our place in the world, and to participate more fully in the process of shaping what it might become.\nThese artworks invite a multi-layered perspective of the world, asking us to empathise with others. We are invited to move with a ballet of traditional hand gestures in Siva in Motion by Shigeyuki Kihara, and be mesmerised by Robin Rhode's animation Promenade. Is Michael Parekowhai's shiny, larger-than-life security guard Kapa Haka (Whero) an imposing or playful figure to be feared or revered?\n'A World View' is a fitting tribute to Tim Fairfax AC, whose extraordinary commitment has helped to bring works by leading international artists into our state Collection for Queenslanders to enjoy now, and into the future.\nTOURING VENUES\nGladstone Regional Art Gallery & Museum, 16 December 2017 - 24 February 2018\nPerc Tucker Regional Gallery, Townsville, 9 March - 15 April 2018\nGold Coast City Gallery, 21 July - 9 September 2018\nCairns Art Gallery, 28 September - 11 November 2018\nGympie Regional Gallery, 10 January - 9 March 2019\nToowoomba Regional Art Gallery, 6 April - 19 May 2019",

    "description": "With its overlapping themes and cross-references, the exhibition weaves a tapestry of interdependencies and reciprocal influences between the individual and society, democracy and the economy, work and leisure, body and mind, nature and culture. Freedom is always relative to other factors and so has to be constantly renegotiated. For instance, one part of the exhibition looks at different forms of state governance that shape the community, while another area addresses the control of information as a crucial instrument of power. Some of the works highlight the fragility of freedom, while others explore identity-defining processes such as work. The public space is also the subject of some of the works. All in all, what emerges clearly is that the autonomy of the individual invariably goes hand in hand with social responsibility.",

Memory that constitutes us as people, that gives body to language and representation, time and document, enigma and suspicion. The exhibition includes 102 works from the Collection, analysis tools that approach memory from different social and cultural implications in their relationship with history, economy or power.\nThe project starts from the need to analyze the intrinsic values   of the memory attached to those objects that we call works of art; how the wealth of a collection is constituted and, especially, how to maintain the complexity, the intensity and the enigma contained in that heritage in a context in which the different political, economic, cultural and leisure levels tend towards simplification, univocidad in the speech, putting in crisis the system of values   sustained in the plurality, the freedom of thought, the knowledge and the critic.\nOroi, 'memory' in Euskera, is situated on the etymological basis of a very broad, open and plural semantic field. For its part, the co-title remains much past ahead places us in an indeterminate space of memory, memory of a past, but located in a time to come. This indeterminacy, undoubtedly, directs us to another moment, neither past nor future, but to the present, a present framed in complexity, in the simultaneity and superposition of times.",

Chapter one looks at the fight for independence in North Africa, the Middle East countries and beyond in the 1950s, the beginning of new languages in art and literature. Chapter two presents works by artists who are part of the Pan-Arab cultural movement in the 1970s. Chapter three looks at the generation of artists who prefigured the Arab Spring in the 2000s inventing new vocabularies that look at societies undergoing change.",

    "description": "In late summer 2018 NASA's Parker Solar Probe blasted off on a historic mission: to get closer to the Sun than ever before. Almost concurrently the Deutsches Hygiene-Museum launches a sister mission of its own, with a large-scale special exhibition aimed at looking at the Sun from all sides. So welcome aboard as we find out more about the cultural significance, scientific findings and some unsolved mysteries surrounding the star around which everything on Earth revolves - and find out more about us human beings, too. How did ancient civilisations on all five continents view the Sun? What can solar science today tell us for certain about the Sun's composition? And what influence does the Sun have on our present, our well-being, and our everyday lives?\nThe first thing you encounter as you enter the exhibition is a spatial art installation inspired by space travel's century-old dream of one day reaching the sun. From there you gravitate along seven 'orbits' circling the Sun from various perspectives: the Sun as deity, as an instrument of time, a symbol, a luminous force, a remedy, an energy source, and of course as a star at the centre of our very own universe.\nThe themes of the exhibition range from worship rituals in Ancient Egypt, alchemy and astrology to solar farms and space probes to bikinis, bombs, and classics of pop music. Each section comprises additional research stations with an opportunity to look deeper into what makes the Sun so fascinating and allow you to reach your own surprising conclusions through a hands-on approach. Here comes the sun!",

    "description": "One of Marx's most quoted and sarcastic statements said that Hegel remarked that all great world-historic facts and characters appear twice, but what Hegel forgot to add is that history comes first as a tragedy, the second time as a farce. It's hard to say nowadays whether history advances linearly and, if that is indeed the case, where it is heading. What is certain today is that the historical events that marked the last century came twice: first as a tragedy, then as a representation. Anyway, this cycle is an ever-recurring one. Thanks to the mass media--from newspapers, radio and television to the web--the account of events have reached a wider audience in the twentieth century than ever before.\nHistories of a Picture to Come is the first of a series of exhibitions with works from the Argos collection that explores the dialectics between photographic and moving images. The exhibition examines how historical events are depicted, told and documented. First-hand or intimate experiences are linked to the Great History, different storytellings blur facts, documents are confronted with aesthetics practices, photographs fail to grasp and tell something about what has happened. However, the aim of the exhibition is neither to establish a hierarchy or inventory, nor to write a history of the twentieth century's massacres--it is meant as an investigation into how contemporary artists reflect on our recent past.",

Four sections reveal thematic ideas shared by artists whose roots are in the Caribbean: Conceptual Mappings, Perpetual Horizons, Landscape Ecologies and Representational Acts. The exhibition features artists whose painting, installation art, sculpture, photography, video, and performance pieces challenge the notion that the Caribbean is insulated and fragmented. This groundbreaking exhibition highlights the undercurrents that connect Caribbean cultures and countries.\nCurated by Dr. Tatiana Flores, Associate Professor of Art History and Latino and Caribbean Studies at Rutgers University, this exhibition was organized by the Museum of Latin American Art in Long Beach, California, as part of The Getty Foundation's Pacific Standard Time: LA/LA, an initiative examining the artistic legacy of Latin America and U.S. Latinos through a series of exhibitions and related programs\nThe accompanying catalogue includes essays by curators, critics, and scholars that discuss particular artistic traditions in Cuban, Puerto Rican, Dominican, and Haitian art, and theorize the broader decolonial and archipelagic conceptual frameworks. The catalogue is coedited by Tatiana Flores and Michelle Ann Stephens, Professor of English and Latino and Caribbean Studies at Rutgers University, New Brunswick.\nSupport for this exhibition is made possible through the FUNDING ARTS NETWORK, INC.",

The result was a collection of international photography, object and video art with the aim of teaching people how to smell through art and at the same time make art more understandable through a fragrance. For this, Ventos developed his own essence for each of his acquired works of art.\nThe exhibition invites you not only to look at, but also to sniff. Let yourself be tempted by the scent of images and be inspired by contemporary art.",

    "description": "As an obsessive consumer and self-proclaimed Internet addict since childhood, Bunny Rogers (b. 1990, Houston, TX; lives and works in New York) probes how the media shaped her identity. Fixated on animated television shows like Clone High and Invader Zim and websites such as Neopets.com, Rogers grew attached to fictional people and creatures that have become recurring characters in her work. These children's programs overlapped in time with severe and violent events widely covered by news media outlets, including the 1999 Columbine High School massacre in which 15 students and teachers died, and another 23 were injured. Rogers grew up during the rise of school shootings and cites the Columbine imagery as significant and unforgettable.\nOver time, mass shootings have become embedded in our global collective consciousness, contributing immeasurably to our understanding of tragedy. Our capacity to process human suffering continues to expand by way of forgetting, desensitization, and disassociation--consciously or unconsciously, we all fall victim. The events, oftentimes too painful to remember, are forgotten and thus wiped from history. We erect public memorials and assign days of remembrance, but healing happens in a private space, undertaken individually.\n\"Today the media landscape looks different than it did in 1999. It is nearly indistinguishable from reality, and vice versa. Turning 'off' is more or less illusory.\" --Bunny Rogers\nImagery that is horrifying or pornographic, uncanny or manipulative, is consumed as automatically as any other imagery. By absorbing these images, we are registering them, and Rogers believes that \"to register imagery is to corrupt imagery.\" How today's traumatic media will affect us tomorrow is unknown.\nRogers relies on corrupted memories to piece together a narrative that both mourns its origins and begs for resolution. Her videos, A Very Special Holiday Performance in Columbine Auditorium (2017) and Mandy's Piano Solo in Columbine Cafeteria (2016) depict rehearsals of ceremonies for mourning. In the cafeteria setting, an unnamed character from Clone High (an animated TV series set in a fictional high school filled with clones of famous figures from history) who Rogers refers to as \"Mandy\" plays piano covers of Elliott Smith songs while drinking copious amounts of red wine. In the auditorium, three cartoon teen girls take the stage to rehearse a song for a ceremony that never happens. Rogers' own voice is heard through the animated character with long hair who sings \"Memory\" from Cats, Grizabella the Glamour Cat's song in which she reminisces about the great beauty she once was.\nSurrounding these videos are Rogers's reproductions of typical American high school furnishings. Though not taken directly from Columbine High, the familiar items become stand-in artifacts of the school shooting. They evoke and hold memories of the tragic event but retain their original appearance and functionality.",

    "description": "In a sketch for a film, Michelangelo Antonioni notes: \"The Antarctic glaciers are moving in our direction at a rate of three millimeters per year. Calculate when they'll reach us. Anticipate, in a film, what will happen.\"\nMetaphorically speaking, to feel cold means to feel deeply alienated. Alienation was already a dominant concern for sociologists around 1900: the alienation of man from society through individualization, alienation from nature through urbanization, alienation from work through mechanization. For philosophers like Theodor W. Adorno, alienation thus turns into a key concept in terms of the role art plays in and for society: Without alienation there is no art, and ultimately it is only art that prevents total alienation.\nIronically, it is the countercultural protest against \"social coldness\" and against the \"rigidification\" of middle-class society in the 1960s that anticipates the ideologemes of flexible Capitalism 2.0. This move, in fact, paves the way for a new type of alienation - one which reverses the metaphorics: Coldness and rigidity are replaced by liquefaction, start-up and dynamics - social alienation, however, continues even as people now strive for self-optimization.\nAntarctica looks at the pattern underlying alienation - this \"relationship based on the absence of a relationship.\" Showing numerous contemporary artworks; the exhibition explores how the term \"alienation\" functions in our world today. In doing so, it also addresses the following question: What other forms of relationship to the self and to the world do we need? Before we can even begin to create something like a space supportive of self-determination and self-realization?\nThe exhibition is preceded by a symposium on the subject.\nArtists: Vilte Braziunaite / Tomas Sinkevicius, Burak Delier, Buck Ellison, Isabella Furnkas, Eva Giolo, Thibaut Henz, Jan Hoeft, Hanne Lippard, Joanna Piotrowska, Jeroen de Rijke / Willem de Rooij, Jana Schulz, Andrzej Steinbach, Ingel Vaikla, Peter Wachtler, Ian Wallace, Tobias Zielony\nCurators: Vanessa Joan Muller, Nicolaus Schafhausen",

    "description": "Since the 2000s, Carla Zaccagnini has been studying and collecting symbolic representations of nations, from their hymns to their flags. In her sixth solo show at Vermelho, Zaccagnini brings together, for the first time, three works articulated around these collections. She also presents a video finalized in 2017.\nIn Prisma [Prism], initiated in 2010 and finished in 2018, Zaccagnini creates a version of the game Pega Varetas [Mikado], where gigantic rods carry the chromatic distribution of the flags from all the world's nations. The artist discovered that all the national flags, together, are formed by 88 tones. From this study, Carla divided the tones by percentages in relation to the total sum and distributed them proportionally by the rods of their game; as if, in a single gesture (that of releasing the rods in the beginning of the game), the tones, as well as the nations, could be mixed.\nIn World Score, of 2018, Zaccagnini created a hymn common to all nationalities from the coincident notes in the sum of the national hymns. Overlapping the various hymns, the artist highlighted the notes that coincided with being written in equal distance from the beginning of the songs, by two or more composers. Zaccagnini emphasizes her intention in the text she wrote to accompany the exhibition: \"How would this new music sound when being made from what is common to all the nations; however, taken from what differentiate each one of them?\"\nSobre um mesmo campo [On the same field] (2011) is part of a comparative study of national flags by the artist, a project still under development. In this part of the project, figurative elements represented in flags from all countries of the world were grouped into 13 categories: Moons, Suns, Stars, Constellations, Maps, Vessels, Constructions, Trees, Birds, Mammals and Dragons, Weapons, Shields and Crowns.\nCut out from a field of black paper, these figurative elements are presented here as absence, a void in the hypothetical common space from which they might have been withdrawn before being placed in the different flags from the different countries which, one by one, they represent.\nAo sol do novo mundo [In the sun of the new world] (2016-2017) was filmed in a mansion of the architectonic group of buildings known as Vila Itororo, built during the XX century for residential and leisure purposes. In 2006, Vila Itororo was declared a public utility area, having been expropriated by the State of Sao Paulo for cultural purposes. In a room of a villa in the village, the artist found several stained glass windows with different flags, including the Brazilian. Throughout the day, the light that enters through this specific stained glass makes the Brazilian flag \"slide\" over the floor. This path traveled by the projection of the flag was recorded by Zaccagnini during two and a half hours. In the background, the sound of reforms taking place in the complex opposing a constructive potential to the ruin suggested by the course of the flag that disintegrates on the floor.\nAbout the artist\nIn 2018, Zaccagnini had a solo show at Museo Experimental El Eco, Mexico City, and also participated in group shows in Sweden, Brasil and Mexico.\nCarla Zaccagnini has in her CV participations in major exhibits including 8a Bienal de Berlim, 9a Bienal de Shangai and 28a Bienal de Sao Paulo. The artist also had her work shown in a wide range of museums including Museu de Arte de Sao Paulo (MASP - Brasil), Van Abbemuseum (The Netherlands), Malmo Kunstmuseum (Sweden), Museo de Arte Contemporaneo de Castilla y Leon (MUSAC - Spain), Nationalmuseum (Sweden).\nSeu trabalho esta presente em importantes colecoes como Pinacoteca do Estado de Sao Paulo (Brasil), Tate Modern (Ingleterra), Kadist Art Foundation (EUA), Cisneros Fontanals Art Foundation (EUA), Solomon R. Guggenheim (EUA) e Museu de Arte de Sao Paulo - MASP (Brasil).",

    "description": "A project by Antje Majewski with Agnieszka Brzezanska & Ewa Ciepielewska, Carolina Caycedo, Pawel Freisler, Olivier Guesselé-Garai, Tamás Kaszás, Paulo Nazareth, Guarani-Kaiowa & Luciana de Oliveira, Issa Samb, Xu Tan, Hervé Yamguen\nCan a shell sing to me? Can a human being be a snake? Can a tree be my mother or father? Can I converse with a river? Can a chicken help to communicate with my ancestors? Are there human beings that know how to sing like birds? Can my apple tree call for my help? Can animals in the forest show me how to survive? Can I listen to the insects in a fallow in the middle of the city?\nCollaborative and trans-disciplinary artist Antje Majewski (born 1968 in Marl, Germany) has opened an ongoing dialogue with colleagues from Brazil, Cameroon, China, Colombia, France, Hungary, Poland, and Senegal, and invited them to contribute works exploring the reciprocal relationships between human and beyond-human beings in a poetic way. The exhibition at Hamburger Bahnhof – Museum für Gegenwart – Berlin stems from this conversation between the participating artists and their interactions with others.\nThe project and its title emerged from a conversation between Senegalese painter, sculptor, performance artist, playwright and poet Issa Samb and Antje Majewski under the trees in his courtyard in Dakar. Sadly, both Issa Samb and the trees are gone today, but the discussion set a process, a laboratory in motion. It was the start of meetings, travels, and conversations between Majewski and the invited artists.\nHow to talk with birds, trees, fish, shells, snakes, bulls and lions takes artists’ interactions with endangered places, societies and environments as points of departure. The presented works often focus on specific places that have been destroyed, altered, or are seriously imperiled by encroaching capitalism, colonialism, and other detrimental human influences. Videos, large-scale installations, sculptures, manifestos, poems, photographs, drawings, and paintings address delicate socio-ecological systems, of which human beings are always a part..\nThe artists speak from personal positions of dissidence to today’s dominant modes of interaction with the environment—whether feminist, decolonizing, situational, and by proposing radically non-capitalist ways of interacting with humans, other living beings, and matter.\nThe emphasis on “speaking” or “talking” raises questions as to how meaning is created and conveyed, and for whom. The concept of “meaning” in Western science seems especially human, since most semiotic modes of communication presuppose a human mindset. And yet language is just one mode of expression in the planetary semiosis, and like other meaningful acts, it is rooted in the environment and all those dependent on it. Talking with birds, trees, fish, shells, snakes, bulls and lions requires keen attention to different voices, and openness to the sound of languages that we might not understand. Enacting this communication means suspending the grammar and style regime, and listening to murmurs and reverberations, repetitions and pauses. We need to learn how to listen and respond to other beings with empathy, attentiveness, and love.\nCurators: Ina Dinter (Hamburger Bahnhof – Museum für Gegenwart – Berlin, Nationalgalerie – Staatliche Museen zu Berlin), Aleksandra Jach (Muzeum Sztuki, Lódz), Melanie Roumiguière (Hamburger Bahnhof – Museum für Gegenwart – Berlin, Nationalgalerie – Staatliche Museen zu Berlin)\nHow to talk with birds, trees, fish, shells, snakes, bulls and lions has received generous support from the Savings Banks Finance Group, main sponsor of the Staatliche Museen zu Berlin.",

    "description": "memory, dystopia, and the postapocalyptic world through still photographs, Marker's film is apt art historical inspiration for Opie's observation on the volatility and disjoint in present day America. The gallery will host an opening reception for the artist at 501 West 24th Street, from 6 to 8 PM.\nOpie's adopted city of Los Angeles, her home since 1988, has long served as a formal and conceptual landscape in her photography, capturing its architectural artery in Freeways and cultural outposts in Mini Malls in the early 1990s, and more recently, its range of influential and famous residents, from Elizabeth Taylor to John Baldessari. Despite her obvious devotion to the city and formal interest in capturing its contrast and depth, Opie remains a realist, offering The Modernist as a portrait of a symbolic \"other\" in an American society committed to a dream that is increasingly becoming a nightmare.\nThe protagonist, played by Opie's friend and frequent subject, the San Francisco-based artist Pig Pen, a.k.a. Stosh Fila, encompasses the embattled, marginalized body that has been ostensibly under attack by the ominous mantra, \"Make America great again.\" In The Modernist, Opie's character retaliates, torching buildings like John Lautner's Sheats-Goldstein Residence (1961-63) and Chemosphere (1960), sneaking in and stealthily dousing the idealized utopian structures in gasoline. Ultimately, this act of arson is a grandiose ploy for the character's magnum opus, a grisly collage of the news clippings covering the fires, the artist's masterful insertion of self into the 24-hour news cycle that craves spectacle.\nOpie's film espouses Marker's formal and narrative structures to address contemporary themes of environmental collapse, global upheaval, and political breakdown. Pig Pen's character, at home in their modest yet stylishly appointed studio, is clearly an admirer of the very designs being destroyed. However, it seems fitting that they would enact their rage against the design embodiment of the mid-century, a period in American history when optimism was high, yet social stations rigid, that was exclusively defined by race, gender, and class. The Modernist epitomizes Opie's aptitude for using the medium of photography to complicate and contextualize individual and group identity; brought to life through the time-lapse of film, her character is allowed to transgress boundaries, both personal and cultural.\nCatherine Opie (b. 1961, Sandusky, OH; lives in Los Angeles) is known for her powerfully dynamic photography that examines the ideals and norms surrounding the culturally constructed American dream and American identity. She first gained recognition in the 1990s for her series of studio portraits titled Being and Having, in which she photographed gay, lesbian, and transgender men and women drawn from her circle of friends and artists. Opie has traveled extensively across the country exploring the diversity of America's communities and landscapes, documenting quintessential American subjects--high school football players and the 2008 presidential inauguration--while also continuing to display America's subcultures through formal portraits. Using dramatic staging, Opie presents cross-dressers, same-sex couples, and tattooed, scarred, and pierced bodies in intimate photographs that evoke traditional Renaissance portraiture--images of power and respect. In her portraits and landscapes, Opie establishes a level of ambiguity--of identity and place--by exaggerating masculine or feminine characteristics, or by exaggerating the distance of the shot, cropping, or blurring her landscapes.\nOpie received a BFA from San Francisco Art Institute in 1985, and an MFA from CalArts in 1988. Solo exhibitions of her work have been organized at Henie Onstad Kunstsenter, Oslo, Norway (2017, forthcoming); Nova Southeastern University Art Museum, Fort Lauderdale, FL (2017); Los Angeles County Museum of Art (2016); Museum of Contemporary Art, Pacific Design Center, Los Angeles (2016); Hammer Museum, Los Angeles (2016); Wexner Center for the Arts, Columbus, OH (2015); Long Beach Museum of Art, Long Beach, CA (2012); Socrates Sculpture Park, New York (2012); Institute of Contemporary Art, Boston (2011); Portland Art Museum, OR (2010); Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York (2008); Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago (2006), Walker Art Center, Minneapolis, MN (2002); and the Saint Louis Art Museum, MO (2000). Select group exhibitions featuring her work include Selections from the Permanent Collection: Catherine Opie and Sterling Ruby, Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles (2017); Breaking News, Getty Museum, Los Angeles (2016-2017); A Slow Succession with Many Interruptions, San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, CA (2016-2017); Human Interest: Portraits from the Whitney's Collection, Whitney Museum of American Art, New York (2016); Who Shot Sports: A Photographic History, Brooklyn Museum, NY (2016); Perfect Likeness: Photography and Composition, Hammer Museum, Los Angeles (2015); Residue: The Persistence of the Real, Vancouver Art Gallery, Canada (2015); America Is Hard to See, Whitney Museum of American Art, New York (2015); Storylines: Contemporary Art at the Guggenheim, Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York (2015); Unbound: Contemporary Art After Frida Kahlo, Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago (2014); and Role Models: Feminine Identity in Contemporary American Photography, National Museum of Women in the Arts, Washington, DC (2008). Her work is in numerous international public and private collections,including Albright-Knox Art Gallery, Buffalo, NY; Miami Art Museum; Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York; The Israel Museum, Jerusalem; Museum of Fine Arts, Boston; Whitney Museum of American Art, New York; The Museum of Modern Art, New York; Hammer Museum, Los Angeles; and the Tate, London.\nOpie has received numerous awards and fellowships, including the Citibank Private Bank Emerging Artist Award, Washington University Freund Fellowship, CalArts Herb Alpert Award in the Arts, Larry Aldrich Award, San Francisco Art Institute President's Award for Excellence, and United States Artist Fellowship. She has been a professor of fine art at UCLA since 2001 and serves on the board of directors of The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts and the board of trustees of MOCA, Los Angeles.",

    "description": "Lisson Gallery is pleased to welcome a new exhibition by Berlin-based artist Ceal Floyer, her sixth with the gallery since she first showed in the same spaces in 1997. Over 20 years on, Floyer has lost none of her defiant simplicity or piercing philosophical precision, producing a distinct body of sculptural works, featuring poetic situations, subtle interventions, as well as new video and light installations.\nA sonic experience beneath a clear, parabolic dome, which contains a directional speaker, hung from the ceiling, briefly drenches visitors with a gushing loop of static sound. While Untitled (Static) could be a strangely meditative zone of white noise, within the already white confines of the gallery, it might also act as an approximation of the sound of rain atop an umbrella, creating a momentary trompe l'oreille (the aural equivalent of a trompe l'oeil).\nElsewhere, a diptych montage of small-sized images of Hotel Rooms (all works 2018) culled from travel brochures and glossy magazines advertising hotel suites and interior decor, is hung on two adjacent walls. This travelogue of pristine lodgings bespeaks not so much Floyer's predilection for ironic image appropriation as it deconstructs some of the hidden conventions of commercial photography: each vista of a freshly made-up double- or twin-bedded haven is shot from either a left-hand or right-hand point of view. Floyer proceeds to uncannily mirror and re-stage the angle of the camera in a literal way by categorising and placing each image on either the left- or right-hand side of the space.\nAn understated survey of what constitutes the boundaries of this exhibition continues on the window where two typical hazard signs depict the maximum headroom available both inside and outside, although the extreme unlikelihood of anyone transgressing the height restrictions render these warnings as merely conceptual in nature. Multiple versions of this work, Maximum Headroom (2014/2018), will be adorning the facade of the Neuer Berliner Kunstverein until next year, further expanding (rather than limiting) where in time or space Floyer's suggestions can exist or operate.\nThe function or lack thereof in Floyer's subversive statements is compounded both by their ubiquity in everyday life and by their absurdity in her hands. As if to ram this point home, the main gallery features an outsized video, Hammer and Nail, of a hammer violently pounding a nail into a board. The progress of metal into wood seems stunted by the movement of the entire filmic frame, which gradually comes up to meet the nail's head with each blow, enacting a negation of duties and a structural reversal or complication of the usual hammer-meets-nail relationship. Riven through, as these pieces all are, with Floyer's inimitable humour and rigour, it is no surprise that she has been included in the South London Gallery's current group exhibition, 'KNOCK, KNOCK: Humour in Contemporary Art' (until 18 November).",

    "description": "Today we live in a globalized world controlled and generated by digital codes. From communication to transport (of people, goods and messages) everything is determined by digital codes. Mathematics and electronics have spawned a new computer-based world designed by engineers, physicists and computer scientists.\nFrom Leibniz's binary code to Morse code, from the cosmic code to the genetic code - we live in a world of codes. The exhibition »Open Codes. Life in Digital Worlds \", which gathers artistic and scientific work, gives us the opportunity to understand this world. In a new exhibition format, the exhibition will present contemporary art and science and enable a new behavior of the visitors. It will be a mix of laboratory and lounge, learning environment and \"Club Méditerranée\" - with free admission! In the museum - as a place of paid citizenship - the appropriation of knowledge should be rewarded. After all, the real message of the digital transformation is that the world of tomorrow will change from a working society to a knowledge society.\nWith you, dear visitors, we want to test new, perhaps unusual, formats of education and learning, and create new approaches to knowledge in a relaxed and inspiring atmosphere. Programming, learning with bots and other new technologies should be made accessible to all. Everyone should be able to understand the \"behind\" of our digital world today.\nThe exhibition presents works of art and scientific works based on both analogue and digital codes. They try to explain the complex dynamics of codes and how they increasingly shape the way we live and how we view the world.\nTogether with our visitors we want to ask:\nDo we want to understand the world in which we live?\nThe exhibition is accompanied by an extensive supporting program with lectures, conferences, symposia, workshops and film screenings. At the beginning of the exhibition, the ZKM and the Council of Europe will be organizing the 4th Council of Europe Platform Exchange on Culture and Digitization on Friday, October 20, 2017, titled \"Empowering Democracy through Culture - Digital Tools for Culturally Competent Citizens\". As part of the »Digital Sovereignty« conference on Thursday, 2 November 2017, high-ranking representatives from science, industry and politics will discuss the sensitivity of digital traces in today's society.",

    "description": "Interestingly, in times of digitization and social media, drawing is once again moving closer to the focus of contemporary artists. This may not be a coincidence, but the medium is generally considered the most direct form of artistic expression. With its intimate appeal, its narrative and subjectively researching potential, the graphic gesture exerts a fascination that is more relevant than ever.\nSince 2006, the French collector couple have been pursuing the goal of supporting artists who use drawing as an essential means of expression with the \"Prix de dessin de contemporainement d'art contemporain Daniel & Florence Guerlain\". Each year, an international commission nominates three graphic positions across national borders, with the nominees having a strong relationship to the French art scene, such as exhibiting participations. The laureate will then be selected by a jury of collectors.\nThe award is an exciting cross-section of current trends in international drawing. The exhibition in the Wilhelm Hack Museum shows all 33 nominees of the last eleven years. In doing so, a tendency towards the figurative, narrative, and even fantastic can be identified, which will be the focus of the presentation.\nOn display are works by Charles Avery, Ulla von Brandenburg, Marcel Dzama, Jana Gunstheimer, Susan Hefuna, Tomasz Kowalski, Ciprian Muresan, Pavel Pepperstein, Catharina van Eetvelde and Jorinde Voigt and others.",

    "description": "Civilization: The Collective Life is a major exhibition, featuring the work of 100 of the world's finest photographers. It addresses and illuminates major aspects of our increasingly global 21st century civilization. It stresses the fact that contemporary civilization is an extremely complex collective enterprise. Never before in human history have so many people been so interconnected, and so dependent on one another. In science and art, at work and play, we increasingly live the collective life. The Olympic Games, the giant Airbus, CERN, MRI, the Trident Submarine, Wikipedia, the Academy Awards, the International Space Station, Viagra, the laptop computer and the smartphone... However we feel about any of them, none of these complex phenomena would have been possible without superlatively coordinated efforts involving highly educated, highly trained, highly motivated, highly connected people.\nThough photography has always embraced investigations of the self, looking inward to existential questioning and individual poetics (what curator John Szarkowski called \"mirrors\"), it can also be said that many of the world's greatest photographers deal with the real world (Szarkowski's \"windows\"). Their work may revolve around the functional aspects of society and culture (home life, pleasure and leisure, travel, religion, the workplace, production and consumption); or revolve around its dysfunctional aspects (alienation, crime, pollution, social breakdown and war). Andreas Gursky's supermakets and rock concerts, Edward Burtynsky's oil fields, Raimond Wouda's high school, Reiner Riedler's families at leisure, Lauren Greenfield's ostentatious displays of wealth - these are only a few of the many subjects covered by the exhibition. Obviously each category will feature the work of several artists. Whatever their particular focus, the photographers have chosen to depict, reveal, examine, critique and otherwise reflect upon our hyper- modern, technologically complex human 'hive', to adopt Tom Wolfe's apt metaphor.\nTaken as a whole, this exhibition takes stock of our civilization's material and spiritual culture, ranging from the ordinary to the extraordinary, and from civilization's great collective achievements and its ruinous collective failings, expressing thoughts and feelings in the richly nuanced language of photography. And though it features photography of the real world, it embraces different ways of dealing with it, from the 'straight' document to the mise en scene.\nIt must be stressed that this is decidedly not a didactic exhibition; images, not words, tell the story of civilization - i.e., the photographs do not illustrate a thesis - they are the thesis.\nCivilization: The Collective Life focuses on shared human experience. We may have never been on a Dreamliner or attended the Academy Awards or met Paris Hilton, but we know all about them, whether we want to or not. Most of us have never come face with an Al Qaeda operative either, but we all have to take off our shoes at security. In his book Civilization (2011), the historian Niall Ferguson notes: \"These days most people around the world dress in much the same way: the same jeans, the same sneakers, the same T-shirts... It is one of the greatest paradoxes of modern history that a system designed to offer infinite choice to the individual has ended up homogenizing humanity.\" This strange paradox is at the heart of Civilization: The Collective Life.\nMajor areas to be addressed in the exhibition:\n1. Habitation. Where we live. The human 'hive': cities, towns, villages, housing structures.\n2. Sustenance. How we maintain physical life. Food, drink, medicine, systems of supply and monitoring\n3. Production. What we make. By hand, by machine. Technology.\n4. Consumption. What we use, how we use it.\n5. Movement. From A to B. Travel, transport. Air, sea, land, space, virtuality,\n6.

    "description": "Fondazione Prada presents the exhibition \"Sanguine. Luc Tuymans on Baroque\", curated by Luc Tuymans, in its Milan venue from 18 October 2018 to 25 February 2019. Organized with M KHA (Museum of Contemporary Art of Antwerp) and KMSKA (Museum of Fine Arts of Antwerp) and the City of Antwerp, the project will be featured in Milan in a new and more extensive version, following its first presentation in the Belgian city from June to September 2018. Luc Tuymans conceived an intense visual experience presenting more than 80 works by 63 international artists, including 25 exhibited exclusively at Fondazione Prada.\n\"Sanguine\" is a personal interpretation of the Baroque based on innovative juxtapositions and unexpected associations of works by contemporary artists and Old Masters. Avoiding a rigid chronological order or a strictly historiographical approach, Tuymans evades the traditional notion of the Baroque and invites viewers to reconsider 17th century art, as well as the contemporary research, by placing artists and their role in society at the center of the exhibition narrative.\nIn the wake of Walter Benjamin's analysis, according to whom the Baroque marked the start of modernity, Tuymans explores the search for authenticity, the political significance of artistic representation, the emotional turmoil generated by art, the celebration of the author's personality, and the international dimension of the art scene, recognizing the Baroque as a primary point of reference for today's art. Not only does \"Sanguine\" push the traditional boundaries of the Baroque notion by extending its duration to the present day, but also it shows how over the past two centuries artists have helped redefine it, from the negative sense attributed to the word by art critics during the late 18th century, to the reassessment operated by Postmodernism and the re-establishment of a Baroque and figurative expressiveness in the art of recent years.\nThe exhibition title--a word that signifies the color of blood, but also a violent and vigorous temperament, and a pictorial technique--suggests a multiplicity of perspectives to interpret the exhibited works, in which violence and its simulation, cruelty and dramatization, realism and exaggeration, disgust and wonder, terror and ecstasy coexist.\nIn Luc Tuymans' vision, Caravaggio--who is represented in the exhibition by the painting Boy Bitten by a Lizard (1595-96) and David with the Head of Goliath (post 1606)-- was the first to transcend classical and Mannerist tradition thanks to the psychological realism expressed by his innovative pictorial language; he also embodied the spirit of the Baroque artist and the wish to communicate with the public through the power of representation.\nThe comparison between Caravaggio and Peter Paul Rubens, the Antwerpian portraitist of prominent figures and himself a diplomat, reveals the formal ambiguity characteristic of Baroque painting and the complexity of the relations developed by artists in Europe during the Counter-Reformation and the rise of the merchant class.\nThe Baroque art of the 17th and 18th centuries was the first global art movement, though it maintained the specific qualities and features of the different local cultures, as well as the sensibilities of the individual artists, represented in the exhibition by Guido Cagnacci, Andrea Vaccaro, Antoon van Dyck, Jacob Jordaens, Francisco de Zurbaran, and Johann Georg Pinsel, among others. In our even more globalized and connected world, suggestions, dynamics and themes typical of Baroque art can be identified in the works by contemporary artists geographically remote from one another and brought together by Luc Tuymans in \"Sanguine.\"",

    "description": "The year 2018 marks the 100th anniversary of the death of Egon Schiele. The Leopold Museum, which is home to the world's most important collection of works by this eminent representative of Austrian Expressionism, is dedicating an exhibition to the artist that transcends all media borders, with paintings, watercolors, drawings, sketches, letters and photographs all affording extraordinary and comprehensive insights into his artistic oeuvre. Even a century after his death, Egon Schiele's oeuvre has lost none of its currentness and virulence. Placed as \"injections\" into the jubilee show, works by Louise Bourgeois, Tadashi Kawamata, Jurgen Klauke, Sarah Lucas, Chloe Piene, Rudolf Polanszky, Maximilian Prufer, Elisabeth von Samsonow and Fiona Tan illustrate the various connecting points to contemporary art offered by Schiele's central themes and motifs, be it in the context of his radical self-reflections and the questioning of his own body, the depictions of women and his ambivalent mother image, his spirituality or the expressive landscapes, cityscapes and portraits.\nThe curated dialogues between the Leopold Museum's central artist and select works by contemporary artists are based on specific references or personal associations, refer to individual works by Schiele or rest on corresponding interests, reinforcing and contouring one another. What these nine staged artistic dialogues have in common is that they focus on similarities in terms of content rather than on formal aesthetic parallels, affording a fresh perspective on one of the most fascinating artists of the 20th century.",

    "description": "Major Traveling Exhibition Brings Nearly a Century of Works by Artists of African Descent to Audiences Across the United States.\nThe American Federation of Arts is pleased to announce a major traveling exhibition created in collaboration with The Studio Museum in Harlem: \"Black Refractions: Highlights from The Studio Museum in Harlem\".

Rooms of the historic Prinzessinnenpalais at Unter den Linden 5 were redesigned by the renowned architectural office Kuehn & Malvezzi, and with clear forms and state-of-the-art technology transformed into a dynamic stage for contemporary culture. The PalaisPopulaire will be a vibrant, cosmopolitan space that connects and enthralls lovers of contemporary art and culture as well as sports enthusiasts. It will bring exhibitions from the Deutsche Bank Collection and important partner institutions to Berlin, as well as concerts, readings, sports workshops, and digital experiences. \nThorsten Strauss, Global Head of Art, Culture & Sports of Deutsche Bank said: \"The name PalaisPopulaire is programmatic. It stands for a place that is contemporary and open, offering an exciting mixture of art, culture, and sports activities. The PalaisPopulaire stands for the fundamental goals that Deutsche Bank has pursued with its cultural commitment for decades: creating access for everyone, recognizing and promoting talent, and thus making a positive contribution.\" The PalaisPopulaire will be directed by Svenja von Reichenbach, who has been in charge of Deutsche Bank's Berlin exhibition activities since 1997, and directed the Deutsche Bank KunstHalle from 2013 until recently.",

    "description": "Landscape is an entity in flux, to be viewed in a cultural perspective, as pictorial and internal architecture of form, and to be understood as a situation in which political and economic histories have left traces behind. Then, the question raised by the exhibition is not \"why we require an image of landscape at all?\", but rather \"which image of which landscape do we need?\", and \"what contribution to it can be made by artistic projects?\" When thinking about landscape we tend to conceive of supposedly escapist, dreamy self-forgetfulness, apparently anachronistic notions of home and fatherland, or at the opposite end of the spectrum, to the tourist cliches. But how could a contemporary image of landscape be composed, acknowledging change, thematizing destruction, and simultaneously being capable of asking questions about the preconditions to a positioning?\nThese basic problems represented the start of the project Remembering Landscape, which shifts the focus towards aesthetic pictorial strategies and links them to aspects of the work of remembering and mourning.\nConceived by Eva Schmidt (MGK Siegen) and Kai Vockler (HfG Offenbach), the project was further developed in cooperation with the Center for Cultural Decontamination (Branislav Dimitrijevic, Lola Joksimovic), MNAC Bucharest (Calin Dan, Sandra Demetrescu), the spaces Sint Lukasgalerie and de Markten din Bruxelles (Leen Engelen, Jan Cools, Nora De Kempeneer).",

    "description": "Press Release\nWelcome to Ciprian Mure?an's fourth solo exhibition at Nicodim Gallery. Let me tell you what you're looking at. A suite of three large-scale drawings encircle the room. Get a little closer. They show Mure?an's voracious appetite for metabolizing the reference indexically. The School of Athens, depositions and adorations, countless archways, doughy portraits in sacred geometries, the many many Jesi... the entire career of the Renaissance's Raphael is zoomed into focus, graphically synthesized in a snapshot, in a grand scribble. Hundreds of sketches dredge every mark the painter made. Each mark, each work that Mure?an faithfully copies is done over top of the last in a palimpsest of cultural consciousness. But this tabula scripta is rewriting art history without affect, without nostalgia, rather as something akin to data mining, a forensic nutrition for the eye as it smudges across the surface.   \nI bet you're wondering what that carnage before you is. This is Mure?an's newest untitled sculptural installation. The work shows the process of writing history played out through the live-action drama of sectarian slapstick. Mure?an has made several archetypal forms atop pedestals that have run amok in the gallery. Wax reductions of spiritual forms, icons, churches and spires, all in a soft beeswax that is more Brancusi than Orthodox, fight for momentary status of survival. Here the pantheon has turned itself into a Thunderdome as these sibling sculptures rival for supremacy.\nThis is how cultural sausage is made. \nCiprian Mure?an (b. 1977) lives and works in Cluj, Romania. His artworks have been exhibited in the 57th edition of the Venice Biennal, the Tate Modern, London, the New Museum, New York, and are also included in key international collections including the Centre Pompidou, Paris, the Deutsche Bank Collection, Germany, and the collection of the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art.",

    "description": "What remains of the war when 100 years have passed? The First World War was illuminated in the recent past from different perspectives. For the first time, the forthcoming double exhibition at the Museum Schwedenspeicher and the Kunsthaus Stade seeks to focus on a very special group of contemporary witnesses, to which so far little attention has been given. These are personal legacies of soldiers who deal with their war experiences in very different artistic expressions. These works paint an unadulterated picture of the war, which at times seems naive and childlike to us, but at the same time creates an incredible closeness to the experiences of those affected. The horror is most likely to be grasped when it receives a human face, thus making this exhibition an immediate reminder and admonition.\nOver the course of two years, the collector, artist and art professor Georg Barber uncovered a culture of remembrance that evidently fell into a gray area. The searching gaze of the artist brought to light works that for the most part can only be found today through the new media. Many areas of this hitherto neglected genre are juxtaposed in the double exhibition: battle paintings and field post cards, propaganda or decorative crafts. The time frame extends partly beyond the First World War and extends from the 17th century to the present day. In addition to works by unknown authors, works by contemporary artists Moritz Gotze, Helge Reumann, Clemens von Wedemeyer, 44flavours, Thorsten Brinkmann, TAL R, Heino Jaeger and Josef Wittlich can also be seen. With numerous own drawings, Georg Barber, also known as ATAK, introduces himself to the exhibition and creates a dialogue between past and present.",

    "description": "In his 2016 lecture at Rollins, artist Trevor Paglen noted that making art is having a conversation with all the people around you, as well as with all other artists who have made images through the centuries. The multi-faceted lens of art helps us make sense of our history, the world we live in, and how it could be different.\nFeaturing a mixture of collection favorites, works that have not been on view in a long time, and debuting new acquisitions, The Place as Metaphor builds conversations around ways of seeing. The works selected for this exhibition illustrate the notion of \"place\" in its varied definitions. Literal places may refer to cities- as in works by Guy Carleton Wiggins (1883 -1962) and buildings by Markus Brunetti (German, b. 1965) and Jonas Lie (1880-1940)- be they real, constructed, or reconstructed. Symbolic places include historical moments, such as the Alyah portfolio by Salvador Dali (Spanish, 1904-1989), commissioned to commemorate the formation of the State of Israel, as well as historical objects with multivalent interpretations, such as the segmented replica of the Statue of Liberty, We The People, by Danh Vo (Vietnamese, b. 1975) and religious objects that inhabited places of faith, such as Seven Saints (Tuscan School, ca.1345). Other works reflect on the space included in or inhabited by sculptural objects, such as the Serpentarium by Lynn Aldrich (American, b. 1944) and A Second of Love by Ernesto Neto (Brazilian, b. 1964).\nCelebrating the transformation of our permanent collection in the last five years, during which 700 new works of art were acquired, the exhibition is a reminder of the broad scope of the collection and the many trans-historical conversations it engenders.",

    "description": "The Culture Collider: Post-Exotic Art\nToday's societies in Far Eastern countries (e.g. India, Pakistan, South Korea, North Korea, China, or Vietnam) are becoming more and more modern, increasing their economic influence and cultural self-assurance. In this New Global World, cultural differences gain significance comparable to the importance of ideological, political and economic ones. At this stage of postcolonialism and confronted with the ever changing economic interrelations and political contradictions, the artists from Asia and Europe who have been invited to take part in the Manggha Museum's exhibition are trying to answer questions about the cultural condition in terms of history, values, mores, aesthetics, origin, language, the role of institutions, and the revival of religion.\n \nConsidered from this position, the subjectivity of an artistic entity manifests not as an indivisible centre or a solistic point of reference but merely as a discreet Deleuzean 'fold' on the surface of the shared cultural idioms in the contexts of cultural dissimilarity.\n \nThe attempts of artists creating post-exotic art towards fusion with the 'Stranger', who actually has long ceased to be the 'Other', and the agonistic (as the term is used by Chantal Mouffe), i.e. divergent interpretations of the jointly adopted rules, often radicalise well-established categories and concepts of cultural values, also provoking a new ideal of aesthetic sensitivity in their audiences.\n \nIn the planned exhibition, the 'collision' of Eastern and Western art takes place not as a linear accumulation but rather as congruences and suspenseful comparisons, oppositions and complementations between the various works of art as elementary particles in a selected setting. The media include painting, sculpture, objects, installation and video.",

    "description": "Hidden Narratives brings together a selection of recent acquisitions from LACMA's growing collection of modern and contemporary art. Though the works on view were made decades apart by artists of different backgrounds, they nevertheless share certain conceptual and formal concerns. The featured artists communicate narratives in artistic mediums ranging from painting to sculpture, from film to mixed media, and through both abstract and figurative means. The stories they relay remain enigmatic, allowing viewers to interpret the works through the lens of their own experiences.\nMany of these artists explore language as an artistic medium or conceptual framework, as seen in works by Jesse Howard, Joseph Kosuth, Los Carpinteros, Alexis Smith, and Lawrence Weiner. Others foreground the body, considering its capabilities and limits, and the stories it might mask or expose; this interest in physicality is evident in pieces by Bas Jan Ader, Lynn Hershman Leeson, Ken Price, Dorothea Tanning, and Idelle Weber. Whether focusing attention on the artists' personal beliefs and experiences, on shared cultural narratives, or on the overlooked, the works included in this exhibition illuminate the times in which they were made while also resonating in the present day.",

    "description": "False Flag: The Space Between Paranoia and Reason is a group exhibition that investigates the continuum of paranoia, as subject matter, philosophical position, and psychological state. Videos, sculptures, paintings, and photographs utilize paranoia as a visual representation and a means of production. The works and the way they are installed produce a kind of looping paranoid state of multiple voices, perspectives, and possibilities, leaving the viewer to establish their own position within this continuum. Exhibiting artists: Darja Bajagic, James Benning, Theodore Darst, Violet Dennison, Michael Green, Mark Flood, Juliana Huxtable, Harry Dodge and Stanya Kahn, Daniel Keller, Son Kit, Tim Trantenroth, and Melvin Way.\nThe exhibition is curated by New Haven based artist Jeff Ostergren and is on view from September 22, 2018 - January 6, 2019. The exhibition opens on Saturday, September 22 at Franklin Street Works annual benefit party, which is a ticketed event, from 5-8p.  There will also be a free, public reception for the show with artist and curator walkthrough on Saturday November 3 from 5-8pm.\nIn contemporary contexts, the term false flag is used to describe a situation where a segment of the population believes that the government, seeking to increase their power or to push through specific agendas, has staged a traumatic event - such as a mass shooting or terrorist attack - and pinned the blame on an individual or terrorist cell. Often called out to stomach-churning effect by the so-called \"alt-right media,\" the false flag nonetheless contains a fascinating and complex system of logic. The obsession with the False Flag allows the paranoiac to always think they are correct, no matter the response. If there is a secret conspiracy and it happens to be revealed, they would be right, and the paranoia becomes an understanding of hidden methods of control (for instance, the NSA spying on Americans). But when such allegations are denied, it is seen as a cover-up act by what is often called the Deep State. Deniers of the Holocaust, 9/11, or the Sandy Hook shooting, for example, are part of this shocking, often hurtful end of the continuum.\n\"The current moment with its great uncertainty, rapid fire flood of voices, and latent violence is the proscenium for this exhibition,\" adds exhibition curator, Jeff Ostergren, \"Paranoia can be seen as both a cause and a symptom of our current anxiety, manifested through competing narratives in the political, social, and environmental fields.\"",

    "description": "Signal or Noise is the second part of the exhibition The Photographic which applies an extended concept of photography, from discipline to mentality. The first chapter, Other Pictures (2017-18), questioned the special potential of the still image. A perspective that with this exhibition is reversed: we turn the gaze inwards and explore the camera as a metaphor for human existence.\nPhotography is to a large extent produced by machines. The reading of an image thus also requires knowledge of the technological development of the discipline, especially because photography has gradually anchored itself in the social sphere. The more images and their environment merge, the more signal and noise become interchangeable. Readable, manipulated and hidden information are increasingly difficult to distinguish from one another, yet are of equal importance in our visual culture. The myth of photographic transparency seems to be irreversibly lost in a mass of pixels, bits and algorithms.\nThis exhibition presents an international selection of artists who recalibrate 'the photographic' as an artistic field of research and experiment. They play on the functions, processes and spaces of photography not with images but via more hybrid forms. From the virtual to the physical, from the technological to the ideological, from image to object to merchandise: the lack of defined identities underpins the questioning of photographic representation. The exhibition is above all a critical space, determined by the unique positions of the artists.",

    "description": "Living and dying, loving and letting go--images, films, books and music about death tap into our deepest fears about the finiteness of existence and our own mortality. Photography may not be the first means used to vanquish, endure and protest against death. Yet since its invention in 1839, photography, its visual strategies, and its technologies have grappled with death like no other medium. Much of this links to photography's unique traits: photographs are seen as cutting across both space and time to capture a moment, and are also considered direct records of reality. Some photographers' works depict dramatic moments of killing, dying, and death with such intensity and complexity that the dead seem almost still to live. Other photographers working in a medical or forensic context produce detached and emotionless documents in which the dead body appears to be little more than an object. In their work, photographers create allegories of Death in which Death itself is not to be seen or, on the contrary, is almost unbearably present. Some of these images are so intense that we feel we are looking our own mortality in the eye.",

    "description": "Image, images - they seem to be the undisputed winners of the ever-swifter contest of cultural transformations that have taken place over the last century. From the celebration of the rise and generalization of the global circulation of a new type of images (photography, cinema, TV, digital), in the turn of the century we moved on to the realization of the triumph of the empire of the images. Concurrently, due to the contradictory nature of all processes of cultural transformation, we start hearing ever louder denunciations of an excess of images, warning us of the dangers they pose as they drown meaning itself in a swamp of endless images which are made irrelevant by their sheer volume and the speed of their epidemic spreading. This phenomenon has been growing in the snowballing commotion of the (anti)social networks that feed the great digital-communicational sty; and whose criminal and predatory vocation only now starts to deserve our attention.\nAnd what about words?\nWhat has happened to words, reduced to a grotesque blather at the fingertips of illiterate youths and foolish leaders? Who will read Proust? Who will have the time for the words with which we make our thoughts and feelings? And this word, \"word\", what will be its value in the future, what will it mean? \nIt is not for me, or an exhibition, to answer these questions; but, as it happens with many other issues, the artists and their works may help us to approach these problems in different ways.\nIn the context of the visual arts, words are markedly present in the early-20th century historical avant-gardes, noticeably in the Dada movement, which can still be looked on - probably - as the most radical in recent history. Even if I want to avoid summarizing the history of words in 20th century art, it is important to highlight their importance in conceptual and postconceptual art, in artistic practices focused on political and civic activism, and in the works of latter artists who have been revisiting and continuing those lines of research.\nRua de Santo Antonio a Estrela . 33 . 1350 - 291 Lisboa Portugal | www.cristinaguerra.com | info@cristinaguerra.com | T +351 213 959 559 Without historiographic pretensions, nor aiming to present the programmatic demonstration of a thesis, this exhibition brings together a diversity of works produced by authors who have, according to their sensibilities and in the context of their lines of research, given words a special place. In this perspective, they offer us the possibility to think and to decide the value of words and what level of attention we want to give them. \nAlexandre Melo",

    "description": "Within the scope of 2018, year of protest, the City of Brussels celebrates the fiftieth anniversary of 1968, a period marked by disruptions and multiple challenges but that remains emblematic for arts and society alike. On the occasion of the ambitious project entitled RESISTANCE, CENTRALE for contemporary arts fulfils its mission as public arts centre and focuses on the ways in which art used and pursued the many society and political challenges that rocked the past half-century.\nEXPO\nUsing a thematic approach, the exhibition studies how contestation and resistance fall within a body of artworks. Instigating a dialogue between historical works from 1968 and contemporary pieces by Belgian and international artists, the show reflects on the huge gateway that opened during that era and that remains connected to contemporary art.\nFrom 1968 to 2018, some artists chose to resist the diktats of the art world and to point the flaws that jeopardize the very foundations of our media-hungry societies. Paradoxically, art drew all its strength from the many resistances and protests imprinted in these art works...\nThe exhibition sheds light on works stemming from a practice of relations broadened to the world, which use unconventional materials and media and that are all animated by a burning desire for action at the heart of the community. A practice founded on firm beliefs that converge with major collective issues such as personal freedom, feminism, globalisation, the environment.\nAt the core of the show, the role of artists unfurls as the key player of a revolutionary thought, somewhere between resistance and protest.",

    "description": "Feast for the Eyes shows the rich history of food photography - not only in the visual arts, but also in commercial and scientific photography and photojournalism. From the banality of the diner-breakfast special of Stephen Shore to the allegorical still life of Laura Letinsky, from Roger Fenton's extensive nineteenth-century displays of food to the cookbooks of the sixties. \nDue to the complexity of the form of food, its meaning and the fact that it is readily available, it has become a much-photographed subject through the history of photography. Interest in both food photography and food as a subject has increased in the recent years. By sharing photos on social media platforms such as Instagram, Snapchat, Facebook and Twitter, photography has become part of the dining experience itself. Photos of food are rarely just about food, food can represent a lifestyle or a nation, hope or despair, hunger or excess.\nThe exhibition explores how food is represented and what its significance can be by means of three themes. For Still Life one of the most popular genres in painting is taken as the starting point. The photographs show how the artists have been inspired by the genre and how it has changed in the course of time. Around the Table looks at the ritual that takes place around food. In addition, this section also deals with cultural identity that is reflected in food. Finally, Playing with your Food shows what happens when humour, fun and irony are combined with food. In addition to the photos there will be a number of cookbooks on display. The books provide an additional visual history and supply context to the photos on the wall.",

    "description": "\"Thinking means venturing beyond,\" German philosopher Ernst Bloch wrote in his extensive study on utopianism,  The Principle of Hope  (written 1938-47). Starting from this notion of thinking ahead, of taking up ideas that root in the present and transferring them to a distant future, the exhibition is characterized by constant change. While 21 artists are contributing works, those will not be shown all together but in sequences, changing the initial presentation every couple of weeks by taking away and adding works. At times very subtle, at other times more noticeable, each sequence will create a different experience for the viewer and establish new links of content and meaning between the works on view. Though the works and artists included in the show are determined beforehand, the evolvement of the exhibition remains open, leaving a part of the presentation to spontaneous decisions encouraged by the interplay of the artworks in the space.\nIn the spirit of thinking ahead and looking back at the same time, the exhibition is bringing together artists that have worked with the gallery for many years as well as new positions that will be shown in the context of Erna Hecey Luxembourg for the first time. While taking stock of the past 25 years of the gallery's activities, the exhibition is also a projection into the future, experimenting with new means of presenting and distributing art, putting works in a new light, and tying new connections.",

    "description": "The two exhibition houses for contemporary art located on both sides of the Rhine, the Kunstverein Ludwigshafen and Port25 - Raum fur Gegenwartskunst present a joint exhibition project with up-to-date art from Finland. With 14 artistic positions from the fields of photography, video and installation, they offer an insight into the Finnish art scene. The variety of possible topics and questions was condensed into two thematic complexes which describe the content of the respective presentation: each exhibition venue focuses on one field.\nThe exhibition at Kunstverein Ludwigshafen deals with the relationship between man and nature from different perspectives. It is an obvious subject for artists from the sparsely populated and wooded region of Europe. However, her gaze goes beyond the land rich in lakes, flora and fauna and places the relationship between man and nature in a global context. The exhibition in Port25 - Space for Contemporary Art consciously refuses to address the theme of nature and focuses on the human being in his political, economic, social and sexual environment. The artistic positions point to cultural dispositions and normalizations of the individual within a society based on unattainable maxims such as permanent success, lasting recognition and boundless growth.\nFigurative traditions, geographical structures or socio-political and infrastructural factors are the basis of a conceptual construction that combines artistic creation with a national aspect. By means of a perspective which partly uses these traditions and factors, but which either breaks cliches ironically or directs the gaze far beyond the national borders to a globalized society, the exhibitions would like to broaden local perspectives and make a contribution to the German-Finnish cultural dialogue.\nFor the exhibition a catalog will appear in the Edition Cantz for the price of 14 EUR.",

Jumping from the atrium wall to the facade windows, the mural offers an immersive experience that--similar to a real landscape--dramatically changes with the shifting seasons.\nHerrero sees his paintings, which range from small canvases to monumental urban spaces, as open-ended landscapes that are never finished, always growing and morphing into something new. In a sense, these works grow beyond the canvas or vertical wall and make their way to the horizontal surfaces of the floor and ceiling, extending his abstract color fields into urban spaces and public life.",

    "description": "Curator: Federico Baeza\nOpening date: April 6, 2018\nClosing date: March 3, 2019\nLatin America: Going back to the future goes through a topography of unsuspected connections between regional modernizing projects and contemporary artistic practices. From the concrete works of the 1950s to the re-readings of that legacy in the present, the exhibition articulates a vast geographical and temporal threshold in which emerge a set of survivals and returns that explode any linear conception of the temporal passage.\nIn the four levels of the museum you can visit a selection of more than seventy artists from the collection, including new acquisitions, as well as invitations made for the occasion. The expography recalls the ways of exhibiting developed during modernism, at which time the museum institution was the object of strong reconfigurations.\nThe proposed works itinerary addresses issues such as the refoundation of the languages   of visuality, the reconfiguration of urban environments, new conceptions of time and space or the generation of images as emblems of utopian projects of transformation of everyday life.\nHow to establish a map of relations between the modernizing Latin American projects of the mid-20th century and the current cultural horizon in which various artistic practices coexist? Latin America: Going back to the future is an exhibition that alters chronologies and puts the most recurrent lineages in crisis to reveal a topography of unsuspected connections and previously ignored contiguities. It is a sample that articulates a vast geographical and temporal threshold in which a set of survivals and returns emerge that make explode any linear conception of the temporal passage.\nBetween the decades of 1940 and 1960 the project of the constructive avant-garde landed definitively in Latin America. In a region free from the traumas of war that ravaged the old continent, the concrete inheritance seemed to find its promised land: a scenario in which to refound languages, arts, sciences, industries, States, cities, is say, all the imaginary and material environments in which everyday life takes place. This movement soon found a currency capable of linking artistic inquiry and material progress: the link between experimentation and development. But at the end of the 1960s and early 1970s that modernizing optimism found its limit. The tensions of the cold war, the hardening of the state repression and the political radicalization collapsed the consensus that supported that development project.\nContemporaneity has been characterized by a spatialized experience of time, a perpetual present populated by kaleidoscopic fragments that are no longer animated by the teleological vector of the future. Perhaps our only common perception of the future is the vision of the ecological, economic and cultural catastrophe that science fiction shows us. In this panorama, Latin America: returning to the future is questioned by the traces of modernizing projects in current artistic production. How to rethink those inquiries about visuality when the notion of novelty has been deactivated? How to deal with the phantasmagoria of modernism disseminated in now ruinous environments? What strategies to implement to make intelligible a proliferating and chaotic time like the one that marks our present horizon?\n- Federico Baeza",

Centered around this filmic journey, the exhibition features a rotating body of work from the MCA's collection that complements Jafa's video and captures some of the same intense emotions about life in America today.

    "description": "30 Americans showcases works by some of the most significant African American artists of the last four decades. This ground-breaking exhibition explores race, gender, and historical identity in contemporary context while highlighting diverse media, subject matter, and perspectives. Artists included here represent the core of an expanding number of talented individuals who are contributing their voices to the history of art in this country. Many of the works on view reveal not only the country's changing view of race and class over the last 200 years, but also address the persistence of racism, violence, and marginalization in America today.\nWorks in this exhibition are part of the collection of the Rubell family. Based in Miami, Florida, they began to collect art in the 1960s and acquired works by African American artists as part of a broader mission to focus on the art of our time. To form their collection, the Rubells visited studios, spoke with artists in depth about their work, and received guidance from gallerists, curators, and the greater art community. Since that time, a movement has emerged that places African American artists at the center of artistic developments in the United States.",

The exhibition spans five continents and features over forty artists, including representatives of historical avant-gardes, members of the Soviet and Brazilian underground art scenes, and new generation artists from Russia, Japan, USA, Zimbabwe, and other countries.\nThe geography of the show is built around twenty-first-century \"silk roads:\" the intercontinental transport routes and production cycles of raw materials, textiles, and ready-to-wear garments from democratic global brands. Based on a series of research trips stretching from Sweden to Bangladesh by way of Ivanovo (Russia) and Biella (Italy), The Fabric of Felicity undermines stereotypical notions of East and West, Global South and Global North and suggests an equality of artistic media, methods, and traditions. The juxtaposition of an Indian folk painting based on India's main epic poem, the Mahabharata, and a massive textile sculpture by American artist Beverly Semmes is just one example of this crossing of cultural borders. Such cross-cultural outreach is necessary work in the context of Russia, where identity politics tends to be based on uncritical Occidentalism or sentimental Orientalism.",

    "description": "Taking the centenary of the revival of Polish independence as its starting point, the exhibition looks at pivotal moments in history and at various liberation movements: beginning with the year 1918, through 1945 - when the political discourse of independence expanded to include the decolonization of the global South - all the way up to 1989, when the fall of Communism ushered in a new era of globalization. The show reveals the gendered character of historical narratives by showing how women have been overlooked in the national narratives in various times and places.\nThe title of the exhibition postulates an urgent shift away from the considerations of symbolic womanhood manifested in allegorical representations of a nation, as in the metonymic expression niepodlegla (\"independence itself,\" referring both to the country, which is a feminine noun in Polish, and a woman who is independent). It looks instead at actual women who played parts in liberation movements, along with what women's presence - or, too often, their absence - may say about the condition of a country, a nation or, more broadly, contemporary culture in general. Hence the \"niepodlegle\" (the plural form designating women of independence) of the title, referring at once to a collective that has been ignored in the telling of history while underlining the political agency of women independent from confines set by the dominant culture. The works of the twenty-nine artists in the exhibition, both female and male, undermine the masculine gaze and patriarchal order of the historical narratives, striving to shape a more diverse representation of women and the way they are depicted in history.\nThe beginning of the 20th century brought forth multiple, often contradictory visions of Polish independence. Pawel Bownik opens the show with the work \"Rewers 8\", depicting the uniform of Marshal Jozef Pilsudski - first leader of the newly independent nation - turned inside out, exposing its intricate seams. This gesture sets forth the exhibition's narrative at the historical moment of Poland's newly reclaimed independence (1918), while calling attention to hidden, invisible aspects of the national struggle such as the erasure of women in the writing of history. It's not widely recognized that thousands of women fought for independence in the Volunteer Legion of Women and other paramilitary organizations established on Polish lands as early as 1912. Only recently have their accomplishments and stories brought them into the spotlight, thanks to the efforts of researchers and herstorians. The counterweight to the figure of Marshal Pilsudski within the exhibition is Rosa Luxemburg, who, despite her political engagement, has never been acknowledged in the pantheon of thinkers of Polish independence. Today, her transnational ideas of struggle against exploitation forge an unexpectedly current perspective on the ills of the contemporary world. \nThe end of the Second World War brought, for Poland and for other European nations, the reconfiguration of world power. Yet at the same time, the new Cold War order opened a new perspective for the liberation of the colonized countries in Africa and Asia. The diptych \"The Widow\" (2013) by Marlene Dumas features Pauline Lumumba, wife of the first president of the Republic of Congo, stripping her breast to protest against her husband's assassination, which had been backed by the CIA. Works by Catarina Simao, Mathieu Kleyebe Abonnenc and Filipa Cesar demonstrate within different media the engagement of women in independence movements in Mozambique, Angola and Guinea-Bissau.\nWoman as a symbol of revolution has always belonged to the imagery of independence struggles. Eugene Delacroix's Liberty Leading the People, depicting a battle in the July Revolution of 1830 led by Marianne, national symbol of French Republic, is one of many examples. Lubaina Himid, in her work \"Freedom and Change\" (1984), and Sanja Ivekovic, in \"Lady Rosa of Luxembourg\" (2001), take a closer look at allegories of the nation and symbols of liberty from the female perspective. In Ivekovic's work, Nike - goddess of freedom, depicted on the monument Gelle Fra in Luxembourg, commemorating the victims of the two world wars - receives a pregnant belly, while the pedestal inscription, originally referring to ideals of the French Revolution, - la resistance, la justice, la liberte, l'independence - has been replaced with words commonly aimed at women: whore, bitch, madonna, virgin. In Freedom and Change, Himid sets up a postcolonial reading of Picasso's 1922 painting \"Two Women Running on the Beach (Race)\" by playing with double meanings of the word \"race,\" and recasting the two main figures in Picasso's work as black women in African batik dress running over a field of spilled coffee beans. \nThe year 1989 is another important point on the timeline of independence. Ivekovic's \"Invisible Women of Solidarity\" (2009) and Zuzanna Janin's \"Wajda. Walesa. Ossowska\" (2016) demonstrate how the Solidarity movement forgot its female heroes after its triumph, locking women out of government and out of the overall historical narrative. Janin's collage is a warning about historical manipulation and the appropriation of Solidarity's legacy by its male figures. A similar perspective on the history of independence is taken by Thenjiwe Niki Nkosi, who paints \"invisible\" heroes of South Africa's anti-apartheid and anti-colonial struggle. By painting her \"personal pantheon\" of heroes, as Nkosi refers to it, the artist tries to question the way historical narratives are shaped by eliminating the multitude of voices and replacing them with the singular and too-often masculine hero. \nThe question of biopolitics and reproduction rights has always been part of women's struggle. After Poland's political transformation, women's independence was swiftly limited, with an abortion ban introduced by the first democratic government as early as 1993. Katarzyna Gorna's \"Ten Virgins\" (1995) is the first and probably the only depiction of that era to recall the thousands of women condemned to endure back-alley abortions. Notions of biopolitics are also raised in the work of Emma Wolukau-Wanambwa, a British artist of Ugandan heritage. In \"Paradise\" (2012), she recalls the story of Polish refugees settled by the British government along Uganda's Victoria River, told through memories of Kasule, a local man who had helped the settlers in the village. By juxtaposing the imagined paradise of the title, recalled by survivors, with the violent testimony of locals who refer to the destruction of mixed-race babies, the artist highlights the lasting taboo within patriarchal societies regarding sexual relations between white women and black men.\nOne of the central themes of the exhibition is the backlash against and policing of women's sexuality within patriarchal society. In the works of Goshka Macuga, Frida Orupabo, Tony Cokes and Zbigniew Libera, this returns with diabolical strength in the guise of madwomen, monster babies and uncontrollable fury undermining and threatening the social order. In Libera's \"Death of the Patriot\" (2016), the fear of female sexuality takes the form of castration anxiety. By transforming women into enraged Furies, the artist points to the fear of female sexuality present in the dominant culture as a threat to the social order.\nThe exhibition culminates with works by Kudzanai Chiruai and Adejoke Tugbiyele, which examine the role Christianity has played in shaping the colonial state through the influence of European missionaries. In \"We Live in Silence\" (2017), Chiruai recasts the history of the post-colony inspired by the film Soleil O by Mauritanian filmmaker Med Hondo, by creating the figure of a woman savior whose symbolic crucifixion becomes a symbol of the death of female independence during the colonial era. Tugbiyele's work \"AfroOdyssey IV: 100 Years Later\" (2014) mingles Christian, colonial and postcolonial literary and juridical sources that all demonstrate, independent of their particular aims, an aversion to the nonheteronormative community in her native Nigeria. \nThe selective nature of historical narrative is an aspect underlined by the exhibition's architecture, conceived by the Berlin-based architect Johanna Meyer-Grohbruegge. It was inspired by the book \"Tree of Codes\" (2010) by Jonathan Safran Foer, an American author of Eastern European-Jewish descent, which attempts a new reading of Bruno Schulz's classic \"The Street of Crocodiles\". By cutting and erasing entire phrases and sentences from Schulz's book, Safran Foer makes it so that the pages, overlapping along with the author's edits, make up a new visual whole, while the text takes on an entirely different narrative. The narrative thread holding \"Niepodlegle: Women, Independence and National Discourse\" together works in a similar way, with the exhibited works coming together as a palimpsest, a collage of diverse images and stories. Considered from this perspective, the exhibition's architecture turns the whole into a text of sorts, indicating missing links and blanks scattered throughout women's history, as it waits for those gaps to be filled in at last.",

    "description": "Since opening in 2005, the Nasher Museum has been dedicated to building a groundbreaking collection of contemporary art centered on diversity and inclusion. The museum's emphasis is on artists historically underrepresented, overlooked, or excluded from art institutions, with a particular focus on artists of African descent. In this effort, the museum supports global artists of extraordinary vision, whose works spark opportunities for thoughtful engagement. Drawing primarily on the collection built over the last 12 years, People Get Ready includes works dating from 1970 through 2018 that address issues ranging from identity to social justice and environmentalism.\nThe title of the exhibition is derived from the 1965 gospel-influenced soul song by Curtis Mayfield and the Impressions. Informed by the civil rights movement and his grandmothers' preaching, the lyrics speak of hope, faith and redemption in the face of hardship. \"People Get Ready\" was sampled and reinterpreted that same year as a ska track by Bob Marley and the Wailers, and then again in 1977 as his reggae hit \"One Love/People Get Ready,\" demonstrating its historical import and cross-cultural appeal.\nPeople Get Ready extends into The Collection Galleries in Wilson Pavilion, integrating contemporary art among historical works in the collection. In doing so, connections across time, space and culture become possible and present the opportunity for challenging dialogue. In the Modern Gallery, the related mini-exhibition People Get Ready: Southern Lens explores southern culture through the museum's rapidly growing photography collection. An early breakthrough work by Fred Wilson, Colonial Collection, anchors the Arts of Africa Gallery, among traditional works of art from the continent. A painting by Kehinde Wiley is now on view in the European Gallery; a work by Pedro Lasch reflects upon works in the Art of the Americas Gallery; a photograph by Eve Sussman brings a new dimension to the Medieval Gallery.",

    "description": "\"Willendorf, Willendorf!\" he calls out, and so do I. Willendorf is a woman of about 40, 100 and 23,000 years of age! She is also called Venus like Lespugue (who was two), Brassempouy, Vestonice, Milo, Stenton and many others. Ten million years ago, acclimating to a new landscape of beautiful meadows and woodlands, their - and our - ancestors stood up, a curious home improvement for better living. And this new stance pushed breasts out, made a boastful belly, sheltered the genitals and encouraged generous buttocks to balance out the build. Woman turned into Venus. Forget that she is a symbol of fertility. How trite. But if with Feldmann and his dolls she's simply called Beauty, and a hint of eroticism is added, then we've got a wholly shared world elegance, a universal, regardless of gender.\nYves Coppens, October 2018\nThe Galerie Martine Aboucaya is pleased to announce the fourth solo exhibit of Hans-Peter Feldmann. Feldmann, born in 1941, burst onto the art scene at the end of the 1960s by composing and exhibiting notebooks made up of found images like post cards, newspaper clips or posters. These images are part of his impressive archive, organized in his very own personal system of series. He's a compulsive collector and wild about images and stories, and an original thinker.\nHe has an often-eccentric relationship with art: in the 1980s he left the art world and sold thimbles by mail order, opened a shop in Dusseldorf, manufactured pewter trains and published artist books. A decade later, he resumed his art right where he had left off. His work recontextualizes our quotidian objects by cataloguing the commonplace and applying new meanings.\nIn this exhibition, he broaches the nude taboos and shows full size sex dolls in daily and familiar situations. One is reading a book and the other is crying. As is his wont, he removes objects from their original context and endows these dolls with the status of a human representation, figurative sculptures without any hierarchy.\nThe history of humanity and the history of art glorified the female body. The representation of nudity is a universal theme. Here, Feldmann kindles our interest in morality, the forbidden and sexuality. The simplicity of his art practice and his curiosity resonate with his immense knowledge of images and works throughout history.",

For this project they thought about the gallery space as \"as a cutting room, a laboratory for cinema\".

    "description": "The group exhibition Klassenverhaltnisse - Phantoms of Perception deal with narratives of class affiliation, decline and social differences that are constantly present in public perception as rarely articulated phantoms and features artists whose works compel us to rivet on such interrelations that lie outside of our conscious field of vision, although they crucially determine the way we perceive social coexistence.\nThe starting point of the exhibition Klassenverhaltnisse (Class Relations) and at the same time an invitation to rediscover an outstanding cinematic work less well known in Germany is Klassenverhaltnisse of the French filmmaker couple Jean-Marie Straub (*1933) and Daniele Huillet (1936-2006) from 1984, a film adaptation of Franz Kafka's novel fragment The Missing Person, shot in Hamburg. The film tells the story of young Karl Rossmann who searches for but fails to find his place in society. Klassenverhaltnisse starts with a much-discussed and seminal image: For minutes on end, the camera shows a static shot of the Stortebeker monument that had been erected two years earlier in what is today HafenCity near his place of execution on the Grasbrook. The naked and chained privateer in front of the huge counting houses commemorates the legendary breach of promise by Hamburg's mayor It is said that he promised Stortebeker to free all members of the crew he could walk past after being beheaded. Stortebeker made it to the eleventh man, yet the mayor had the entire crew executed. With this first image, Straub/Huillet immediately focus on the fragility of the social order, law, freedom, and hierarchies seemingly cast in bronze for eternity\nThe camera in the complexly constructed image spaces of Klassenverhaltnisse rarely assumes a position corresponding with the usual viewing habits in cinema. Events are constantly taking place in an expanded space that the viewer perceives but does not see directly. The image of the ghost is central in the discussions on social realities, as Jaques Derrida describes the ghost as the \"present without presence\". The art historian and theorist of perception Ernst Gombrich described \"phantom percepts\" as the circumstance that we never only see what we see, but always anticipate, remember, and think along with the Using \"phantom percepts,\" artistic works are on view that expand the space of perception and problematize social interrelations, while at the same time employing a technique and a language that engender these interrelations. But Phantoms of Perception refers to more: To how artists take on perspectives that other people usually don't. Since 1920, film shots from such an angle have been called phantom shots in the USA. Harun Farocki, who played a French immigrant in Class Relations and made a film about the shooting at the same time, used this term in his analyses of today's technical images.\nThe exhibition aims to break away from familiar thought structures: Is it possible to work with phantom percepts to redirect the gaze of the viewers to new ways of seeing? Can their interpreting expectations be used to draw attention to another object, to other contexts? Can disturbances be caused that suddenly make phantoms already located in the same space visible?\nThe central questions of the show have to do with the current problems posed by the illusion of a classless society: Class relations exist, but as phantoms, because the concepts that describe them are hardly present anymore in the public discourse, in culture and the media. The exhibition takes a look behind the mechanisms with which artists expand our scope of perception in the inner space of contemporary art, and at the social realities with which they confront us there. It examines the phantoms currently gripping our society in power mechanisms, in the causes of rising rightwing populism, and in the apparently spreading fear of social and economic decline\nAdhering to Erhard's maxim of \"prosperity for all,\" millions of Germans had one goal that could actually be achieved: a place in the middle class. It meant more growth and social peace that would benefit all. Against this backdrop, class appears a hopelessly outdated concept, as a relic from the class struggles of the 1970s. Didier Eribon, however, points out that \"when one simply eliminates 'classes' and class relations from the categories of thought and comprehension, and thus from the political discourse, one by no means avoids that those who are objectively affected by the relations behind these terms feel themselves collectively abandoned.\"The book's success and core argument indicate that there clearly was and still is a void in the public discourse, a lacking awareness of the social realities, especially in (leftist) politics and among the well-educated populations in metropolitan regions.\nThe exhibition negotiates these themes, which are at the center of the challenges that must be faced for societies to succeed in the 21st century, not as abstract and aloof ones, but with the experiential space of very specific realities of life by setting Karl Rossmann's universal odyssey in relation to Hamburg.\nThe exhibition is curated by Bettina Steinbrugge, Benjamin Fellmann and Tobias Peper.",

    "description": "Highlanes Gallery, Drogheda and the FE McWilliam Gallery & Studio, Banbridge, present a joint exhibition entitled Crossing Lines, which will run concurrently in both galleries from 23 November 2018 to 26 January 2019. The exhibition explores ideas of dissent, dissonance, and difference in art and society; embracing change, inspiring hope, and the important role that art and artists have in challenging traditional thinking, provoking reflection, insight and fostering new ideas that often defy the norm.\nCrossing Lines is a response to the challenges of Brexit from the perspective of two galleries whose very existence was built on a cross border partnership to provide a major cultural and tourism resource for the border region. This project has at its heart a serious effort to increase cross- community and cross border co-operation in the arts and culture through a special East Border Region EU INTERREG IIIA Partnership.\nThe opening of these cross-border exhibitions will be marked by a special live performance by Nigel Rolfe at Highlanes Gallery on Friday 23 November at 7.30pm, and at FE McWilliam Gallery & Studio on Saturday 24 November at 3.00pm\nIn accepting the adversity of our current global condition, and its often fierce antagonistic and conflicting ideologies, this exhibition considers individual and collective expressions of difference, across race, gender, sexuality, class, & religious, political and social systems, globalisation and climate change, and how human expression can shape society.\nAmong the artists exhibiting are Duncan Campbell, Joy Gerrard, Stuart Brisley, FE McWilliam, Victor Sloan, Susan Philipsz and Maud Sulter; with artwork selected from Arts Council Collection, Southbank Centre, London, the Arts Council of Northern Ireland Gifted Collection (2012), National Museums, NI and artist's studios.\n \nExhibiting Artists: John Behan, Paul Bowan & Andre Stitt, Ian Breakwell, Stuart Brisley, Duncan Campbell, Tarik Chawdry, Jack Crabtree, Jack Cudworth, Anthony Davies, Rita Duffy, Joyce Edwards, Joy Gerrard, Sunil Gupta, Lawrence Abu Hamdan, Sonya Hanney & Adam Dade, Siobhan Hapaska, John Benton-Harris, Mike Hogg, Bob Jardine, Gavin Jantjes, Tam Joseph, Peter Kennard, John Kindness, Permindar Kaur, Terry Loane, Olga Magliocco, Alice Maher, Colin Middleton, Fionn McCann, Declan McGonagle, F.E.

The project involved a capital build in both partner areas of Banbridge and in County Louth. In Banbridge the project enabled the creation of the FE McWilliam Gallery & Studio which is dedicated to the memory of one of Ireland's most influential and successful artists and in Drogheda; and in Drogheda, Co. Louth, the project facilitated the restoration of a Franciscan Friary, namely Highlanes Gallery to world class exhibition standard, and to house the prestigious Drogheda Municipal Art Collection. Both Galleries provide a major cultural and tourism resource for the border region, developed to 'British Museum Standard B' with the capacity to house major exhibitions the galleries' have offered a major boost to the North East Regions' offering. This project has at its heart a serious effort to increase cross-community and cross border co-operation in the arts and culture.\nHighlanes Gallery, Laurence Street, Drogheda, Co.

    "description": "For this group exhibition, 49 Nord 6 Est--Frac Lorraine spotlights non-systematic processes of dissemination of information and alternative modes of sharing knowledge. The British conceptual artist John Latham(1921-2006) developed a body of theories that occasionally delved into occasionally sowing confusion, provoking disapproval, or stirring enthusiasm. His approach constitutes the groundwork of this show, which brings together artistic practices of different backgrounds and generations. The accessibility of knowledge and its arbitrary dissemination raise issues addressed by the artists who explore alternative paths. At a time when the gap between opinion and knowledge is closing, and the relationship between materiality and knowledge is undergoing a profound transformation, the present project introduces approaches that reflect processes of information transmission in order to reevaluate the experiences produced by these practices.\nThe featured works reflect interpersonal relationships shaped by transmission of knowledge, as well as the power structures thereby legitimized and the resulting hierarchies. The artists appropriate the forms generated by this transmission-- such as books, periodicals, photocopies, posters, faxes -- and underscore, or sometimes activate, scenarios that bridge the classical division between knowledge and experience, between teaching and practice. The works on view point towards the impossibility of objective transmission and encourage the production of critical tools questioning norms associated with learning processes.\nJay Chung & Q Takeki Maeda and Eva Weinmayr play in their respective works with the occasional confusion that can arise between artwork and document, highlighting the way in which the very circulation of images produces a story. In turn, the graphic designer Sheila Levrant de Bretteville and the artist Alex Martinis Roe bring to light the heterogeneity of experiences informing their respective projects and give shape to processes of transmission built around a plurality of voices. Building on their work with the zine ground, Marlie Mul & Harry Burke discuss with the students of the Ecole Superieure d'Art de Lorraine various concepts of grassroots education, and turn this exchange into a poster featured in the exhibition. A wide range of documents from the John Latham archives, as well as works by the artist, are presented in this context, establishing a discontinuous base for this show. Fabriques de contre-savoirs follows the winding paths where information and knowledge intersect, opening along the way onto unexpected phenomena and encounters.",

    "description": "It's about technology changing what it means to be human. There's a self-actualization aspect to it that's potentially positive, but I mostly associate it with the relentless push to squeeze more productivity out of workers--turning people into reliable, always-on office appliances.\n--Josh Kline\nGagosian is pleased to present Laws of Motion, an exhibition of works by Josh Kline, Jeff Koons, Cady Noland, Rosemarie Trockel, Jeff Wall, and Anicka Yi. The exhibition will open in Hong Kong and travel to Gagosian San Francisco in January 2019. Its title refers to Karl Marx's application of scientific laws to systems of capital.\nForty years ago, the art of Koons, Noland, Trockel, and Wall merged strategies of commercial display and formalism, isolating inherent social archetypes and stereotypes. Laws of Motion begins with key artworks from the 1980s that responded to a world saturated in the aesthetics and language of advertising, exploiting its techniques while making visible its latent and subconscious pull.\nKoons's paradigmatic series The New examines themes of domestic use and hygienic order, employing industrial readymades such as vacuum cleaners stacked and isolated in gleaming museum vitrines. The built-in obsolescence of domestic tools and consumer products contrasts with their aspirational qualities, raising philosophical questions of newness and desire. While Noland's assemblage of emptied beer bottles and a discarded mailbox in Trashed Mailbox (1989) conjures a potent image of American male delinquency, Trockel's wall-mounted stove top reduces or elevates a central symbol of domestic life to pure geometric abstraction, obliquely engaging a feminist discourse.\nIn the late 1970s, Wall began presenting photographs as light boxes, a format typically used for display advertising. Over the following decades, he created images that were both epic and intimate reflections on the actions and accumulations of daily life. Diagonal Composition (1993) depicts banal and abject subject matter using formal harmony and rich chromatic detail. In Men Move an Engine Block and Siphoning Fuel (both 2008) the car is a focus of both communal enterprise and criminal exploitation.\nWith the onset of the digital age, the relationship between marketing, labor, and value has grown ever more symbiotic, just as the purity of art, media, and data becomes increasingly elusive. Recent works by Yi and Kline identify updated manifestations of the heady consumerism of the 1980s. Yi engages the politics and personal resonance of chemicals, bacteria, and other normally ambient matter, in order to create moments of disequilibrium that underscore gender inequality, environmental degradation, and institutional mechanisms of power and control. For Immigrant Caucus (2017), she distilled a number of olfactory elements into portable spray cans, asking, \"How do we imagine that immigrants, or foreigners, smell?\" On Being Biochemical and Quorom Sensing (both 2018) are rectangular wall-hung boards covered in what resembles an organic growth: mold or fungus, as though a clinically defined area has been turned into a breeding ground, inadvertently becoming something like abstract painting. The surface of each work is interspersed with shelves or openings through which light, fake flowers, or hardware can be seen, giving a previously unperceived depth to the rectangular board. For Deep State (2017) she made light boxes from photographs of bacterial cultures, the intricate organic patterns frozen mid-bloom or decay.\nBody parts, pharmaceuticals, and sanitizing products pervade Kline's assemblages, installations, and videos, reflecting on the ways in which technology impacts humans. Riffing on familiar phrases such as Handled with Care (2017), his monochromatic gray piles of rubble suggest the potential consequences of automation and artificial intelligence on labor, namely mass unemployment. In this sense, Kline's postapocalyptic assemblages function as punctuation marks to the excesses of the 1980s.\nBy manipulating systems of production, marketing, and display in art within the gallery setting, this cross-generational exhibition probes the similarities between the logic of market production and formalism itself. Over the past four decades, as technology has evolved, artists have changed their approaches to it and to the societal upheaval it has effected. Yet, despite the changing mechanisms of consumption, the human relationships to object and product remain startlingly similar.",

    "description": "Night Gallery is thrilled to present a solo exhibition of new works by Jesse Mockrin entitled Syrinx. This is Mockrin's third exhibition at the gallery, following The Progress of Love in 2016 and Midnight Sun in 2014.\nSyrinx takes its name from the wood nymph of Classical Greek mythology, often mentioned alongside Pan, god of nature, who became enamored of her and began to chase her through the forest. Syrinx, desperate to flee, asked for help from the water nymphs, who turned her into river reeds so that she could escape him. Overwhelmed with frustrated desire, Pan cut the reeds, and with them created the first panpipes. The myth has appeared in paintings throughout history, invoked by artists including Peter Paul Rubens and Noel-Nicholas Coypel as a testament to passion as the root of artistic creation. Absent from that commentary, however, is a consideration of Syrinx's reaction to Pan, a reframing by which the story becomes one of a woman who chooses to end her life rather than be raped - of female terror existing at the site of male expression, perhaps as its very basis. \nJesse Mockrin's diptych \"Syrinx,\" 2018, cites both Rubens' and Coypel's paintings and places them side by side, cropping gestures from each one and painting them isolated them against backgrounds of matte black. A mere inch apart, the two panels at first appear to present one continuous image. Close inspection, however, reveals two iterations of the same scene: a man's arms reaching for a woman who flees him, just barely out of grasp. Citing works painted one hundred years apart, both of which refer to the same legend of antiquity, Mockrin's arresting painting suggests a vicious, violent cycle of history, transforming the source material in a stunning redress of ancient narratives with an all-too-familiar imbalance at their foundation.\nThe audacious, masterful works that comprise the exhibition Syrinx all employ this simultaneous quotation and intervention, deriving references from Baroque history paintings of mythical and biblical scenes, Renaissance-era etchings and drawings of witches, and hunting paintings from the Romantic period. In dialogue with one another, these citations explore depictions of women and violence across several hundred years: the first category considers images of women under duress, while the second category reclaims the condemned figure of the witch as a feminist forebear. The hunting paintings, meanwhile, emphasize the threat of violence throughout the works, nodding to the commonplace nature of violence in the history of painting - dating back to the first known paintings - and pointing to the class system within which these depictions of brutality would become markers of status. \nMockrin's methods of cropping, enlargement, and combination destabilize her source material, invigorating them with new significance even where her renderings remain faithful. These monumental, staggeringly exacting paintings are a testament to the meticulous depth of Mockrin's research and the utter virtuosity of her hand, yet the series transcends the boundaries of her individual perspective, operating instead at the scope of history and the elevated register of the iconographic. As Mockrin herself puts it, \"I want to explore things that aren't so much tied to my experience but to the history of images, the images that we consume, and larger societal questions... People talk about making the personal universal, but I am actually more interested in the public record.\" In Syrinx, we find Mockrin's offerings to history, themselves documents of a present-day society urgently grappling against its enduring demons. \nJesse Mockrin (b. Silver Spring, MD, 1981) received her M.F.A. from the University of California, San Diego, in 2011, and her B.A. from Barnard College, New York, in 2003. Mockrin has had solo exhibitions at Night Gallery (Los Angeles), Nathalie Karg Gallery (New York), and Galerie Perrotin (Seoul). In 2016, she had a major presentation at the Rubell Family Collection in Miami, and her work is also in the collections of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA) and the Hans-Joachim and Gisa Sander Foundation. Mockrin's work has been covered extensively, appearing in publications including Artforum, The New Yorker, T Magazine, Modern Painters, and Art Agenda, among others. She lives and works in Los Angeles.",

    "description": "Lua Cao is an experimental exercise derived from the intersection of works by Alexandre Estrela and Joao Maria Gusmao + Pedro Paiva, originally presented at an old sawmill by Galeria Ze dos Bois. The exhibition curated by Natxo Checa consists of twenty moving-image pieces: videos by Alexandre Estela and 16mm films by Joao Maria Gusmao + Pedro Paiva. Presented in this former industrial area, these works were not only shown on screens or similar media but also formed a constellation of pieces that were activated at different moments during the visit. Thanks to this configuration, Lua Cao is presented as a performative film production rooted in a mechanical vision, which rejects conventional perspective in favour of an immersive, panoptic experience.\nThe collision of two worlds-the universes of Alexandre Estrela and Joao Maria Gusmao + Pedro Paiva-produces non-linear, empathetic, randomly synchronised narratives which, in a shared manner, focus the viewer's attention on empty spaces through the materialisation and objectification of the image, the alignment of the pieces or the intervals created by the sequences.\nThe curator and the Portuguese artists have had a close relationship for over two decades, ever since they decided to travel together to different locations across the globe. Those journeys became experimental exercises for collecting shared experiences at each stop along the way, and this exhibition is therefore a product of that personal collaboration.",

    "description": "It will frivolously come and go in the rooms of the Kunsthaus Zug. Maybe just a bit rough. Maybe omitted or messed up. Sometimes deeply sad.\nThe exhibition draws on the philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche, who describes the monstrous life as a comedy of existence. Free spirits must be able to laugh, even about themselves. One needs a cheerful art as well as the fool, so that one does not lose his freedom in all the things and how dancers and children can float, sneer and play. This shows the desire of artists in the clownish game with themselves.\nAt least the tragic attack on the editorial offices of the Parisian satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo has brought back the old question of humor in liberal democracies.\nThe Kunsthaus Zug sends its visitors through the art history of humor in seven-league boots. Since 2011, a working group from the home has been researching the relationships between art and humor with scholars and scholars, going back to the Greeks, turning over the Middle Ages to reformation through the mediaeval and errant routes, and denying the material battle in the last century and today.\nLiterature, music and philosophy are included, theater, variety and cinema. The journey leads to laughter in the church, to the street theater and to the Fasnacht. Gender relations and social oppression, confrontation with the body and with death are constants. It is clear: the observers should laugh. A supposed taboo in the museum is broken. Wondering who laughs about what? The exhibition becomes an experiment on visitor behavior in the museum and self-criticism of its authority.\nMore than 300 works compose the comedy of existence - loans from Switzerland and Europe as well as works from the own collection. It is a test arrangement with vases, pamphlets, drawings, magazines, paintings, sculptures, photographs and videos: Here the laughter gets stuck in the throat, it is smirked by the humor of Bruegel d. A. or Goya, Ensor or Klee, Daumier, Picasso or Heartfield, Duchamp or Warhol, Oppenheim or Ai Weiwei. Sometimes situational comedy and horror, lust and shame, joy and horror stand side by side, close to each other.",

Souvent subjective, parfois incomplete, cette collection laisse deviner la personnalite de Gottfried Honegger et Sybil Albers, leurs preoccupations, et tres souvent leur esprit visionnaire sur la creation de leur epoque. \nSi le coeur de la collection s'est bien sur construit autour des grands noms de l'art concret, les donateurs ont su resituer cet ensemble dans la longue histoire de l'art abstrait europeen depuis 1900.\nFideles a l'esprit d'universalisme de l'art concret, Gottfried Honegger et Sybil Albers n'ont pas circonscrit leurs choix a une declinaison d'oeuvres purement geometriques. Ils en ont ouvert la portee par une reflexion sur les prolongements les plus marquants, parfois surprenants, que le XXe siecle a produits, faisant de leur collection une oeuvre a part entiere. \nDe cet ensemble d'oeuvres emerge une vision historique des grands courants ou tendances qui ont traverse l'abstraction au XXe siecle. \nEn portant un nouveau regard sur le reel au debut du siecle dernier, les artistes ont ouvert de multiples voies pour questionner les elements plastiques de la creation. La composition, le rythme, les materiaux sont devenus les nouveaux sujets de la peinture. Tout au long du XXe siecle, ces recherches ont federe les artistes et impulse la naissance de mouvements artistiques. \nC'est donc cette lecture originale ou se croisent les choix personnels des collectionneurs et l'histoire de l'art que propose le parcours aujourd'hui presente dans nos salles.",

    "description": "This year, the theme of the Municipal Art Acquisitions exhibition is 'Freedom of Movement', a term that is commonly used to describe civilians' ability to travel visa-free outside their native land. The exhibition brings together work of the 20 artists who have been selected by a jury for the Municipal Art Acquisitions 2018. This year, the Municipal Art Acquisitions focuses on the field of time-based media: artworks that last for a specific length of time, such as film and video work, internet art, performance, dance, sound art, and even workshops.\nThe title 'Freedom of Movement' refers to the ability of citizens to travel, visa-free, outside their native land. As neo-nationalist and populist political movements gain traction in the West, usage of the phrase \"freedom of movement\" has become loaded with connotative associations. How much freedom do we have, and how much do we allow others? Interpreted poetically, the notion of \"Freedom of Movement\" also refers to the body itself: its ability to move, take action and have agency.\nFrom a variety of perspectives, the works in the exhibition engage with movement as a political fact and explore the idea of movement, and migration, (a theme explored by Stedelijk over the past year). The show presents artworks addressing the restriction of movement, the varying power of nations' passports, surveillance performed by the Dutch Immigration and Naturalization Agency, the conflicts of dual identity and the integrity of the body.",

    "description": "In March 2018 the New World Summit - Rojava, also known as the \"People's Parliament of Rojava,\" will be inaugurated in Derik, Cezire Canton. Simultaneously, on March 17, a reconstruction of the parliament will open in the Van Abbemuseum in Eindhoven: adding a unique space for public assembly to the functions of the museum. \nThe Democratic Federation of Northern Syria, also known as Rojava (West-Kurdistan) was declared independent by Kurdish revolutionaries and their Arab and Assyrian allies in 2012. Rather than an independent state, Rojava is organized as a \"stateless democracy,\" aimed at local self-governance, with an emphasis on gender equality and communal economy. Despite ongoing threats by the Islamic State and recent attacks of Turkey, the Rojavans have been able to create a new social model with universities and cultural centres, all reflected in the internationalist collaboration of the New World Summit - Rojava.\nAmina Osse, Chair of the Committee of Foreign Affairs, commissioned artist Jonas Staal and his New World Summit team during a 2014 research travel to the region to develop a new public parliament that would symbolize the achievements of the Rojava Revolution. Osse proposed this parliament would become a public space, to be used by local communes for demonstrations, cultural events, and international conferences. This public parliament would be a symbol of a new world in the making, while simultaneously being one of the places where this new world is made.\nInspired by New World Summit - Rojava parliament the Van Abbemuseum wants to experiment with new forms of public assembly within a public art museum. Considering the multiple moments of crisis in traditional, western democratic states, the museum parliament seeks to widen and diversify the platforms within which stated and stateless humans can act. Alongside the parliament, an exhibition documents the process of its conceptualisation and visual design. For the period of at least a year, this new facility in the museum will be programmed by the Rojavan diaspora in the Netherlands and Europe as well as by the Van Abbemuseum and Staal's team. It will introduce audiences to the philosophy of Rojava's stateless democracy, its challenges and achievements, its art, culture, music, and poetry. It will be a space for teaching and practicing democracy anew.\nDuring the inauguration of the parliament in the Van Abbemuseum, Rojavan representatives, Kurdish thinkers and artists, as well as the Rojavan solidarity network, will assemble to present the revolutionary politics and culture of Rojava, discuss the current defense of Canton Afrin, and the transformation of an art museum into a new public parliament.\nThe People's Parliament of Rojava is a project by the Self-Administration of the Democratic Federation of Northern Syria / Rojava; the municipality of Derik; Studio Jonas Staal; and the Van Abbemuseum, in collaboration with the Democratic Union Party (PYD); International Free Women Foundation (IFWF);  The Time Has Come; Kurdistan National Congress (KNK); Kurdish Democratic People's Center Eindhoven; Demned - Council of Communities from Kurdistan; and Jineoloji Center of Research for Human and Social Sciences of Women.\nThis project would not have been possible without the work of the New World Academy (2013-16), co-founded by BAK, basis voor actuele kunst, Utrecht, and Staal, which developed the first stages of exchange between Rojava and the Netherlands through its educational sessions and reader.",

    "description": "\"I am not a piece of shit I am a piece of society\" - in letters vigorously painted upon the canvas, the artist Bjarne Melgaard comes right to the point: art demands its place in society. Since the mid-1990s, Florian Peters-Messer, a real-estate entrepreneur from Viersen, has collected more than 350 works of contemporary international art that are being presented for the first time in this form in the context of a museum. The exhibition offers a pointed, sharply contoured selection of highly political, sometimes explosive works that address the social dislocations of our era in a critical, often oppressive manner. \"What Paradise?\" does not only inquire into lost promises, however. It also focuses on the individual, on his hopes and possibilities in an increasingly complex and incomprehensible world that apparently considers everything to be possible through globalization and digitalization, even while itself being scarcely understandable. The exhibition deliberately turns its attention to the relationship between aesthetics and ethics, hence to the social function of art overall. \n\"What Paradise?\" brings together internationally renowned, frequently discussed positions including Kader Attia, Thomas Hirschhorn and Santiago Sierra, but also still-to-be-discovered artists from a younger generation such as Viktoria Binschtok or the Iranian Arash Hanaei, who is represented with his shocking textual work \"Death of a Photographer.\" In addition to what are in some cases large-format photographic works, sculptures and videos, a painting and several drawings, visitors will also have the chance to experience a space-encompassing, kinetic installation by the American artist Jon Kessler. \nBjarne Melgaard, I am not a piece of shit I am a piece of society, 2009, Peters-Messer Collection @ VG Bildkunst, Bonn 2018\nThe artist Peggy Buth is represented with a video work that gives visual expression to failed utopias in an impressive manner. \"Demolition Flats\" shows the tearing-down of apartment buildings on the periphery of Paris, where in the 1960s immigrants from North Africa were supposed to find, if not a paradise, at least a new homeland. The districts fallen into such disrepute were compelled, along with the persons living in them, to give way to other projects of urban planning.\nIn his disturbing photographic series \"World of Warfare,\" Julian Roder shows how with its military, death-bringing equipment, the armaments trade fair in Abu Dhabi is staged with effective audience impact. The portraits of the South African artist Pieter Hugo constitute a sharp and thought-provoking contrast. These are portraits of young men at the notorious Agbogbloshie Market in Ghana's capital Accra - a terrifying expanse of debris upon which waste products from the electronics industry are recycled under the worst possible health conditions. \nIt is with mixed feelings that one views the two-part video projection by the artist Yvon Chabrowski. Countless persons dressed in gray may be seen. Mutely silent and crowded together, they move alongside and directly upon each other. A seemingly peaceful convocation which, however, is often disturbed, inasmuch as it is necessary to forcefully assert one's position. An image with long-enduring impact, because the question indeed arises as to how and under what conditions a successful cohabitation can be organized with respect not only to the individual, but also to the community.",

    "description": "For a long time, the attention paid to graphic design focused on the flagship object of the discipline: the poster, a medium that allowed large formats: 4 x 3, Decaux, 80 x 120 ... The formal kinship of this support with the painting and the tradition of biennials and competitions favored the spectacular dimension of it to the detriment of other graphic objects (invitations, flyers, ephemera, bookmarks, business cards ...) which often remained less visible because more modest in size, the printing technique used or the expected uses. However, the posters and these various other objects already coexisted (and still coexist) in the practice of graphic artists.\nSeveral economic crises later, the conditions of the order have changed. The economic constraints weigh heavily on the sponsors: they lead to rethink the graphic projects and to consider logics of occupation and diffusion different, by experimenting other interstices where the graphic design can develop / exist.\nThrough a radical scenographic bias, the curators and the designer remodel the Art House Bernard Anthonioz to turn it into a space halfway between library and archival site and evoke the future fund of small graphic objects which, initiated for the exhibition, is expected to grow and increase as he goes on his future journey. The exhibition will be presented at the beginning of the year 2019 at the Higher School of Art of Cambrai, then in other schools of art and cultural places in France and abroad.",

    "description": "\"I was mostly just interested in the physicality of what I'd seen in the animatronic field, and I was also interested in making a sculpture that had the potential to be chronological or structural in the same way a video is. My hope is that the work dips in and out of spectacle.\"\n--Jordan Wolfson\nArtist Jordan Wolfson's (Female figure), 2014, is an immersive environment that features a robotic sculpture. For seven minutes, the robot gives monologues and dances to pop songs. Startling and unnerving, the work raises the specter of misogyny and exposes fissures in pop culture. It challenges the ways women are represented, and the ways images of women are consumed.\nThe sculpture resembles a hypersexualized female, but it also complicates such a reading and evades easy consumption. In a brightly lit room that is more sterile than sensual, the robot wears a witch mask and is covered in black smudges. The figure faces a mirrored wall to which it is attached by a rod piercing its torso. Traditionally, art is a one-directional experience: you alone observe the artwork. Here, however, the robot uses facial recognition software to \"look at\" the viewer, returning your stare. This may feel like the sculpture is objectifying you, treating you like an object.\n(Female figure) challenges assumptions about gender, sexuality and even our status as human subjects.\nThis artwork has extremely limited capacity and is not suitable for children.",

    "description": "A Venezuelan artist currently residing in Portugal, Juan Araujo (1971) has been developing work in the areas of painting and drawing that charts a whole host of relationships, oscillating between the recent history of art (especially the memory of modernism), modern architecture - with an emphasis on the modern architecture of Brazil and Latin America - and the current thinking about the labyrinth of references that define our creative processes. Each exhibition of Araujo's work is a dense forest of connections and references, a palimpsest of narratives directing our attention to the work of such architects as Luis Barragan, Pancho Guedes, Burle Marx or Lina Bo Bardi and such artists as Mark Rothko or, more recently, Jorge Molder, all coming together to form a cultural map, or an immense cabinet d'amateur.\nAlso the structure that the artist has presented for the exhibition at Culturgest - conceived as an installation, centred on the appropriation of the central figure of the second vanguards, Roy Lichtenstein - becomes a game of recognitions for the spectator.",

    "description": "This exhibition assembles photographs, films, and performance documentation by women artists who situate the nude female body in outdoor landscapes. It is organized in conjunction with a major retrospective exhibition of modern American photographer Anne W. Brigman, who was noted for her pioneering nude self-portraits made in the early twentieth century.\nâLaid Bare in the Landscapeâ brings together a range of imagery: from beautiful and sensual self-portraits, to sometimes-surreal and provocative statements by feminist artists beginning in the 1970s. The artists interrogate ideas surrounding beauty, femininity, vulnerability, ritual, identity, and body politics, as they relate to nature and the environment. Artists in the exhibition include Laura Aguilar, Ruth Bernhard, Judy Chicago, Imogen Cunningham, Louise Dahl-Wolfe, Judy Dater, Mary Beth Edelson, Regina Jose Galindo, Sally Mann, Ana Mendieta, Otobong Nkanga, Joan Myers, Jo Spence, Carollee Schneemann, and Francesca Woodman.\nTo compare the proto-feminist landscape photographs of Brigman to her feminist counterparts of the latter twentieth- and early twenty-first centuries is to weave a new thread through generations of visionary women artists who have aimed to further alternative ways of seeing and knowing.",

Caracas, Venezuela; lives in Los Angeles), Curator of Special Projects, LACMA, Los Angeles; Candice Hopkins (b. Whitehorse, Yukon; lives in Albuquerque), Independent Curator, Albuquerque; Ruba Katrib (b. Baltimore; lives in New York), Curator, MoMA PS1, New York., with Naomi Beckwith (Marilyn and Larry Fields Curator at the Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago) as curatorial advisor.\nThe title of SITElines.2018 references Argentine writer Julio Cortazar's 1946 short story \"Casa tomada\" (House Taken Over), which follows two shut-in siblings devoted to the care of their ancestral home. As a mysterious and unnamed presence begins to occupy parts of the house, they are eventually forced out onto the street without any material possessions. The exhibition plays off the ambiguities of this story, addressing the reciprocal and complex relationship between the ones who stay and the ones who leave, and those that belong and those that are outliers.\nQuestioning notions of private property--of the body, mind, land, and culture--the exhibition asks how boundaries are dissolved and/or violated. Why do we create these divisions? What marks the difference between guest and trespasser? Who is the host and who is the visitor, and when are these roles reversed?",

    "description": "Patti Smith's \"Pissing in a River - Watching it Rise\" (1976) stands metaphorically for resistance and rebellion. To begin with, the lyrics refer directly to intensive feelings of inevitability, uncertainty and vulnerability, which the musician transforms through a provocative and self-determined act of strength and courage. In this way, making a break with societal conventions leads to the self-empowerment of the lyrical protagonist.\nIn the framework of the exhibition project Pissing in a River. Again!, 31 contemporary female artists from various generations show works from a range of diverse media, including videos, sculptures, paintings, photographs, and performances. The works grapple with social questions in diverse ways. Attributes such as strength, independence and decisiveness - ostensibly associated with masculinity - are thematically appropriated by the exhibition's female artists to take on other characteristics.\nThis approach is also taken up in the spatial concept of the exhibition, which was likewise conceptualised by the artists Stephanie Kloss and Andrea Pichl: fragments of a roof structure made of black sailing rope connect all exhibition spaces and artistic positions. In between, the proposed colour Cool Down Pink is applied as a critical commentary: the rose tint has a calming effect and de-escalates the potential for aggression according to psychological studies. Meanwhile, it also refers to traditionally feminine gender roles and norms in which resistant behaviour is not allowed any space - and has instead long been associated with hysteria.\nPissing in a River. Again! celebrates the diversity of contemporary female artists who position their work intensively and offensively in an art world still dominated by masculinity - or who directly challenge this. At the same time, the project brings together a selection of female artists of various generations, mostly living in Berlin. With the support of a diversity of methods and materials and an extensive programme of side events, the exhibition teases out the rules of feminine self-determination: provocative, humorous, loud, and strong.",

    "description": "David Klein Gallery, 1520 Washington Boulevard, Detroit, Michigan, is pleased to announce the opening of Liz Cohen, Stories Better Told by Others. This new series of work is Cohen's tribute to the women who were Lowrider Magazine cover models from 1979 through 2015. A reception for the artist will take place on Friday, November 2nd, from 6 - 8 pm. There will be an artist's talk at the Detroit gallery on Saturday, November 3rd at 3:00 PM.\nLiz Cohen, a photographer and performance artist, has received international recognition for her Trabantamino project which includes Rio Grande, Bodywork, Tools and Zwickau Routine series.\nOver the course of eight years Cohen customized an East German Trabant into an All-American El Camino, implementing hydraulic technology gleaned from the Lowrider culture of her native Southwest. Lowriding, originally developed out of the Pachuo Chicano community, was a homegrown culture of resistance and became a practice of defiance against mainstream America by the people who participated in it. Cohen's dedication to the Lowrider culture was rewarded in 2013 when her Trabantimino won the top prize at the Lowrider competition held annually in Espanola N.M. Now Cohen has turned her focus to the women whose presence on the covers of Lowrider Magazine added to its success for more than 35 years. This new series pays homage to the women themselves with images of the Lowrider magazine covers with the relevant costumes and tools and branding each photograph with the name of the cover model.\nCohen states: \"There are stories that are better told by others. In 2015 Lowrider Magazine stopped using models on their cover. The images in Stories Better Told by Others commemorate the Lowrider Magazine cover models that contributed to the aesthetic, style, and attitudes of Lowrider culture.\"\nLiz Cohen was born and raised in Phoenix, Arizona. She holds an MFA from California College of Art, San Francisco, CA, a BFA from the School of the Museum of Fine Arts Boston, MA, and a BA from Tufts University, Medford, MA. Cohen's work has been exhibited widely in the U.S. and abroad including Site Santa Fe, Santa Fe, NM; Ballroom Marfa, Marfa, TX; San Francisco Art Institute, San Francisco, CA; El Paso Museum of Art, El Paso, TX; Universidad Politecnica de Valencia, Spain; Museum Tinguely, Basel, Switzerland; Cranbrook Museum of Art, Bloomfield Hills, MI and the Museum of Contemporary Art Detroit, MI. Liz Cohen currently lives and works in Phoenix, Arizona.  For further information please contact: Christine Schefman Director of Contemporary Art christine@dkgallery.com",

His famous maxim, Form follows Function, was soon taken up by Louis Sullivan and later especially at the Bauhaus, where it experienced a decisive refocusing with the ,,renouncement of any ornament\".\nForm follows Fiction, a word play that gives the exhibition its title, negates function in favor of invention, imagination and pure presumption, while still following the concept of economical form developed at the Bauhaus. Invited were artists with different and distinct personal perspectives, whose work is also characterized by complexity and precision of form.",

    "description": "Gagosian is pleased to present New Capri, Capri, Free Capri, three interconnected series of paintings by Mark Grotjahn and his largest exhibition of new work to date. Stemming from a body of work that he created for a private presentation at Casa Malaparte on the isle of Capri, Italy, in 2016, these paintings signal an entirely new direction in Grotjahn's practice, as he breaks away from the Face paintings in favor of a more experimental, spontaneous working process.\nIn his paintings, drawings, and sculptures, Grotjahn interweaves and revitalizes various historical modes of abstraction, probing the limits between gesture and geometry, impulse and exactitude. His works unfold according to precise yet mutating rubrics, resulting in an expansive vocabulary of visual motifs that migrate from one series to the next in compulsive, self-referential permutations. Like sedimentary cross sections or horizonless landscapes, the Capri series contrast the allover quality of Abstract Expressionism with moments of controlled, almost minimalist, logic.\nGrotjahn began New Capri in 2016, inspired by the legendary home of writer Curzio Malaparte perched on a cliff in Capri. Painted on cardboard and framed behind glass, the New Capri works appear as small, jewellike objects, echoing the geological and botanical patterns of the Mediterranean setting (itself framed by the house's windows). Seeking to abandon the representational qualities of his Face paintings (2003-)--in which almond-shaped eyes form focal points within kaleidoscopic abstractions--Grotjahn zoomed in on their multicolored arcs, then explored variations of certain sections on a larger, more enveloping scale. Thus, in the Capri works (2016-), painted on canvas, he alternates between vertical and horizontal structures, obfuscating any remnants of the Face paintings by making use of the infinite mutability of paint itself: spreading it; creating rolls, balls, and splatters; writing his name and various dates. The Capri paintings challenge the viewer to determine the chronology of Grotjahn's marks and strokes, which are raised from the picture plane like impenetrable, thorny brush, trapping the gaze in their puzzling matrices. In the red, black, and white Star Capri paintings (2017-), the tips of the almond-shapes from the Faces form rhythmic geometries, like graphic stars or flowers.\nIn Free Capri (2018-), the last of the three series, Grotjahn seems to have fully abandoned the Faces. Many of the canvases feature parallel rows of \"slugs,\" grids of squirming tally marks, which accumulate on Grotjahn's palette knife as he smears into the dense impasto while it is still wet. Literally pulling the background into the foreground, Grotjahn attaches the slugs to the surface of the painting by tracing a thin line through them, reuniting the painted surface with its own waste products. Tapering at either end, the slugs seem alive, wriggling their way into the compositions and picking up streaks of color along the way.\nA fully illustrated catalogue will accompany the exhibition.",

    "description": "Around 1980 they experimented with bold lyrics, photography, fashion, performance, film, music - and giant canvases. She found her themes and motifs in the subcultures of big cities, in the gay scene or in the punk and new wave movement, for example. Museums and collectors tore themselves above all around the painting of the so-called new savages. When this group label, invented in Aachen by the founding director of the Ludwig Forum in the media, became increasingly established despite the differences between the local scenes, many of its protagonists were already pursuing individual careers.\nToday, the Neue Wilden are considered one of the last great artistic movements of the 20th century. The success story of a young German generation of artists, whose images were perceived internationally as a revival of figurative painting, has become an art-historical myth.\nIn addition to large-format paintings from Peter and Irene Ludwig's collection, the exhibition \"The Invention of the New Wilden\" presents numerous works and documents from the experimental early days of the artists and their surroundings. They show how diverse the sources were, from which painting drew its abundant energy.\nIn the winter of 2018/2019 there will be a publication with scientific essays, interviews and historical source texts on the topic, dt./eng., About 280 pages.\nArtists: Hans Peter Adamski, Peter Bommels, Werner Buttner, Luciano Castelli, Walter Dahn, Ji?i Georg Dokoupil, Rainer Fetting, GL Gabriel-Thieler, Anne Jud, Martin Kippenberger, Helmut Middendorf, Hilka Nordhausen, Markus Oehlen, Brigitta Rohrbach, Salome, Bettina Semmer, Bettina Sefkow, Claudia Skoda, Rolf von Bergmann, Bernd Zimmer and others\nCurators: Benjamin Dodenhoff and Ramona Heinlein",

    "description": "Pressetext\nGalerie Mezzanin is delighted to announce a solo exhibition of the Belgian artist Michel Francois.\nFrancois is an interdisciplinary artist, known for working cross-media, in that often transcending genre. Though he claims no signature style, he idiosyncratically generates interconnections, tensions and resonances between his works, thereby creating a place for dialogue and exchange not only amongst visitors and objects, but also within the exhibited works themselves.\nSimilar to the Arte Povera artists, Francois uses great economy of means to transform seemingly usual and mundane objects and materials, into carriers of meaning.\nInfini, a simple rope in the shape of an eight or the infinity symbol, showcases how the status of an object can be modified by the effect of contextualization.\nThe play with precious and cheap materials, as can be seen in Peanuts stick, is, however, not the only antagonism Francois employs in his works: In Debordement, a sponge soaked with ink deposited on a plaster sphere, the stark contrast in color also evokes multiple exegeses.\nThe centre piece of this exhibition, A souffles perdus, a string with handblown glass balloons in red and black, is not only a very poetic hommage to sculpture, but also an evocation of Francois' understanding of ephemera: \"the materials that I use replace the absent courses, they are presences for absences (echoes the condition of the living).\" (1)\nThe only photograph in this exhibition, Heterophoto, derives its title from \"heterotopia\" (Greek: hetero= different/other, topos=place), a concept elaborated by the French philosopher Michel Foucault. It describes a certain place that is surrounded by a sense of otherness and alternated reality (e.g. ships, prisons, cemeteries). Being neither a dys-, nor a utopia, the term heterotopia characterizes places which function as microcosms in themselves, \"juxtaposing in a single real place several spaces, several sites that are in themselves incompatible.\" (2)\nFrancois constructs a puzzle of contrasting colors, illusions, materials, shadows and light into a complex whole that serves as both a parable of what sculpture is capable of being and an enigmatic representation of his oeuvre.\nDepending on one's perspective and point of view, the interpretation can be a narrow tightrope walk that is often on the verge of instability and shapeshifting thanks to the ambiguous and janus-faced character of his pieces. This richness in meaning, after all, is what makes it possible to visit and revisit his exhibitions, each time taking home a new revelation.\n(1) Paris-art.fr, 5 juillet 2012, http://www.paris-art.com/interview-artiste/michel-francois/francois-michel/492.html\n(2) Michel Foucault, \"Of Other Spaces: Heteropias and Utopias,\" (\"Des Espaces Autres,\" March 1967), translated from the French by Jay Miskowiec, Architecture/Mouvement/Continuite, October 1984",

Many of the patrons resisted the police raid, and the following day thousands of people marched in the streets, speaking out about unfair treatment under the law. It was the start of the modern gay rights movement.\nToday, transgender female prisoners (male to female) are incarcerated in male prisons, and transgender male prisoners (female to male) are incarcerated in female prisons.

    "description": "PRODUCE, PRODUCE, PRODUCE(D)\nOn moving image production and beyond\nAs the hectic progress in technology generates the illusion of hyper-connectivity, it simultaneously feeds the desire of quick-acting individuals to manipulate space and time. While new generations of multi-taskers grow up seemingly networked to each other, the mobile Web becomes the terrain where nimble relationships of ostensible proximity are consumed.\nThe users of always newer and easily accessible technologies become potential mass-producers that stuff the Internet with (apparently) non-restricted content, and they concurrently turn into unaware 'makers' of manifold versions of themselves. While these virtual replicas become estranged from the very body that owns them, they also generate a flow of online contributions that rapidly transform into accumulated waste.\nIn this context, digital platforms and social media provide the means for texts, images, spams, viruses to be created freely and endlessly copied, shared and downloaded, making it a hard job to detect authorship and filter among these chaotic mass of public domain.\nThis persistent obsession with hysteric production - that goes well beyond the Internet and its remote extensions as an intrinsic feature of late capitalism and neo-liberal ideologies - then poses important questions on the nature of the relationship between the producer and the product as either codependent, subaltern or mutually antagonistic.\nIndeed, if the very etymology of the word production (from the Latin producere, 'to bring forth') implies an active \"way of motion or functioning\", it is not always clear who is the agent that carries out the action and who is the recipient of it. In other words, in an era of frenzied economic, political, social and cultural change, not only we are empowered offline and online producers but also alienated products of such unstoppable acceleration.\nIn departing from these considerations, this year's edition of LOOP will then look at production as an open-ended process of creation that simultaneously determines and affects the artists' practice as well as the related modes of distribution and circulation in art.\nThrough a series of exhibitions, screenings, performances and workshops and a solid selection of panel discussions oriented at addressing the specificity of the moving image, the programme will ultimately propose a reading of production as a dynamic system where different disciplines mingle and interact, while looking critically at the accumulation of images and its effect on the construction of subjectivity and the self. Besides, the committed work of international production companies will also be put into value along with the exhibition of recently created artists videos representative of contemporary creation.\nEverything connected by two essential underlying questions: \"How do we produce?\" and \"How are we produced?\"\nCarolina Ciuti\nArtistic Director",

God's Oasis', the artist's first solo exhibition to be shown at the gallery's Zurich location in collaboration with Mike Kelley Foundation for the Arts. Regarded as one of the most significant artists of our time, Kelley's multifaceted oeuvre challenged the social and cultural conventions of contemporary American society through absurd, comical and acutely postmodern formulations. The exhibition will display rarely exhibited works on paper, including a selection of early student drawings, revisited paintings and his final body of two-dimensional works from the Untitled series of collages (1974 - 2011), many of which have never been seen or exhibited before. The immersive installation 'Rose Hobart II' (2006) and the mobile sculpture/drawing assemble 'Repressed Spatial Relationships Rendered as Fluid #1: Martian School (Work Site)' (2002) will also be on view. The presentation, curated by Peter Pakesch, provides a deeper understanding of Kelley's evolving career by investigating the artist's work as a student in Ann Arbor and his reconsideration of this artistic output decades later.\nOver the course of a career spanning four decades, Kelley (b. 1954 - 2012) developed a substantial body of work which encompassed drawing, painting, sculpture, video, performance, music and critical writing. Born in Detroit, the artist studied at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, before relocating to Los Angeles in 1976 to enrol in an MFA programme at the California Institute of Arts. A response to the prevailing modernist aesthetic he encountered at the University of Michigan, Kelley often appropriated imagery from low-end vernacular such as comic books, erotica, pulp fiction and advertising. Kelley's works abound with loaded representations of American society and demonstrate his fixation with formations of adolescence, educational structures and memory - themes which the artist revisited throughout his practice and are explored in the exhibition.",

    "description": "The exhibition Congo Stars shows popular painting created between the 1960s and today, as well as works in other media. In cooperation with the Royal Museum for Central Africa Tervuren, Kunsthalle Tubingen, Iwalewahaus in Bayreuth, and PICHA in Lubumbashi, Kunsthaus Graz will display works by around 70 Congolese artists living in Paris, Brussels, Kinshasa and Lubumbashi.\n \nThe book Tram 83, written by the Lubumbashi-born and Graz-based author Fiston Mwanza Mujila, served as a conceptual starting point for the exhibition. In it, he describes an imaginary place that, while based on the (harsh) social reality of Congolese cities, could in fact be almost anywhere. In the exhibition, divided into six chapters (\"street\", \"bar\", \"home\", \"stars\", \"spirituality\", \"exploitation\"), real and imaginary places and spaces that function as generators of community and identity are intertwined, condensing moments of fiction. The individual chapters are not separate from one another, but form a continuous narrative, being interconnected and consolidated through recurring motifs and themes. Alongside works of art, a timeline provides information on the history of key events and contextualises the works on display. The accumulation of diverse material and a range of visual levels are used to create an almost overwhelming density, reminiscent of the density of a Congolese city.\n \nEssential for the decision to show Congo Stars at Kunsthaus Graz are the sometimes surprising historical and current relations between Styria, Austria and Congo. The connections and interdependencies are multifacetted and extend far back--from educational programmes in the 1960s to the decades of teaching by two Austrian professors at the Academie des Beaux-Arts in Kinshasa to the activities of the writer Fiston Mwanza Mujila who lives in Graz today. Important Congolese artists such as Cheri Samba and Tshibumba Kanda Matulu exhibited in Graz in the 1990s, and there are also three important Austrian collections (the Ethno-Medicine collection / Weltmuseum Vienna; the Horvath Collection for Political Art, Linz; the Peter Weihs collection, Kukmirn), which --in addition to lenders from Brussels and Paris--made important works available for the exhibition Congo Stars.\n \nCongo Stars is not a \"national exhibition\" or even a showcase for the Democratic Republic of Congo. The title conjures up the star in the flag and alludes to the changing political systems and regimes--because not only the name of today's Democratic Republic of Congo, but also the national flags have been modified, depending on the state doctrine. The title also refers to popular culture, to local and international stars and heroes, and, beyond that, to literally reaching for the stars. Zaire, the state's name between 1971 and 1997, was able to afford an ambitious space programme. The many utopian, futuristic-looking representations by the artists also ultimately speak of a longing for a social space that is positively occupied--both territorially and temporally in an \"outside\" space. Ultimately, \"Congo\" is projection screen, imagination, dysfunctional state and contested territory in equal measure.",

    "description": "Artist Otobong Nkanga (Lagos/Antwerp) returns to ar/ge kunst for her first solo show in Italy having previously participated in the programmatic exhibition Prologue Part II - La Mia Scuola di Architettura in November 2013.\nGathering recent works, ongoing projects and two new commissioned pieces, 'A Lapse, a Stain, a Fall' articulates a further step in Nkanga's research about the manifold values of natural resources in the Anthropocene; a process she carries on alongside an unceasing exploration of the reciprocity between earth and language morphologies.\nEmploying sculpture, drawing and performance, but also writing, publishing and pedagogical formats, Nkanga looks at the notion of 'land' as a geological and discursive formation, often taking as her starting point the systems and procedures by which raw materials are locally dug up, technologically processed and globally circulated. From there she follows the threads that intertwine ores, material culture and the construction of desire with the redistribution of power and knowledge.\nOtobong Nkanga conceived 'A Lapse, a Stain, a Fall' as an organic display of artworks that unfolds in space following a chromatic rhythm, from black to an increasingly composite palette of colours, a progression of pieces 'germinating' alongside a new, central artwork that, as an artery, runs the length of the architecture from wall to wall, turning the exhibition into a living, diasporic organism where body parts hold together by their skin.\nThe centrality of the notion of the 'body' in Nkanga's thinking resonates deeply with the title of the newly commissioned work, 'Veins Aligned', a 27 metre sculpture that lies on the floor of ar/ge kunst and is composed of strata of glass and marble from the Lasa quarries, both materials having been crafted in collaboration with local experts. It is a sculpture that evokes the deep feeling that Nkanga' nurses for matter, i.e. the urge to produce a continuity between materials that can function as a support structure as well as recognizing all its layers as carriers of situated knowledge; from the skin and its desired lustre through the complex molecular structure with its geotechnological properties. It is a knowledge that deserves to be excavated while also making visible how every process of extraction runs the risk of becoming capital extraction and potentially also a violent act towards a body, be it of humans, materials, or lands.\nThanks to Alessandro Cuccato and Alessandra Piazza for the technical support that allowed the realization of the work 'Veins Aligned'.\nA special thanks for the material and the production to\n- Lasa Marmo\n- Gruppo Dalle Nogare\nWith the kind support of\n- Flanders, State of the Art\n- The Autonomous Province of South Tyrol, Department of Culture\n- Fondazione Cassa di Risparmio, Bolzano\n- City of Bolzano, Department of Culture",

    "description": "For the first time, the M HKA will be able to present a permanent collection exhibition with iconic masterpieces from Flemish and international artists. The collection exhibition is free to visit on the ground floor. Permanently installed collection works can also be admired elsewhere in the museum.\nThe art works are chosen out of the M HKA collection which consists of approximately 5000 works of art. The core of the collection is made up of the museum's own acquisitions and works that have been acquired by the Flemish community. In addition, there are donations and a number of public funds that are made publicly accessible by the M HKA, such as that of De Vleeshal in Middelburg. The collection starts with the post-war avant-garde in Antwerp and Flanders, and uses this epoch as a starting point to gain understanding of the multi-polar world of today and the future.\nThe M HKA collection is set up around three approaches to art: image, action and society. While generally works cannot be classified exclusively under one of these denominators, they are useful approaches to explore the particularity and complementarity of our collection. Image, action and society are the three axes that together make up the space of a work of art: every performative work has a pictural quality, looking is action and every work of art relates to society. This division, therefore, primarily aims to be a starting point from which the public can interact with the works and create new connections.\nThe M HKA presents a permanent collection with works by Marina Abramovic & Ulay, Dirk Braeckman, James Lee Byars, Thierry De Cordier, Raoul De Keyser, Lili Dujourie, Marlene Dumas, Jimmie Durham, Jan Fabre, Dan Flavin, Jef Geys, Jan Henderikse, Ilya & Emilia Kabakov, Gordon Matta-Clark, Almagul Menlibayeva, Otobong Nkanga, Cady Noland, Panamarenko, Michelangelo Pistoletto, Cindy Sherman, Joëlle Tuerlinckx, Luc Tuymans and Jan Vercruysse.",

    "description": "Transience is one of the key themes of the Olbricht Collection. And what artistic medium other than photography could be better suited to addressing the questions of time and history that this theme throws up? Lending duration to the moment is inscribed into the very medium itself. In this property, art and philosophy come together. Ever since Antiquity, eternity has been described as timeless, and it is in this sense that Goethe equates the moment with eternity in his poem 'Vermachtnis' (Legacy, 1830). For humanity, the moment is the only perceptible slice of eternity.\nGoethe's 'legacy' is to shape the world through sensuous and reasoned perception: Jumping ahead through the epochs, this fits together with Henri Cartier-Bresson's dictum of the 'decisive moment' to describe an art that is able to simultaneously capture the essence of an event and the form that corresponds to that essence. Just as the photographic grasp on reality intensifies the signs and symbols of an era, the interplay of other art forms also reflects diverse aspects such as duration and transience. The expansive range of the Olbricht Collection explores such themes as beauty and sensuousness, becoming and disappearing, and the body and society, as manifested in various epochs and media.\nPhotography's replication of reality is only apparent. From documentation to self-reflection, it provides information about the human condition and about society through the ages. With his epochal study on 20th-century humanity, August Sander provides an example of how a belief in the factual force of the photographic image combined with the comparative faculty of sight can generate a binding social typology. Collecting and preserving is not just the business of scientists, or that which is revealed in the sedimentary deposits of cells (as in the shell of a turtle), it also describes the practice of a contemporary artist like Nicholas Nixon, with his visualization of time passing like sand through an hourglass in his Brown Sisters.\nImages and reflections, projections and interrogations of self, play a major part here. It is not just the the reflective surface of the gelatin silver photograph which Otto Steinert emphasizes in his negative double-headed portrait of a woman that holds up an image of its age to the viewer, but also the cultural history of roles and rituals that Cindy Sherman dramatizes, or that Lee Friedlander captures in the form of a laconic self-portrait. The immediacy of a direct interlocutor is another aspect that we find in a number of these works, for example in the monumental Photo Realism of a Franz Gertsch, the Expressionist, evocative art of Emil Nolde, or in Andre Gelpke's confrontation with the red light district.\nContemporary painting has found powerful instruments in its engagement with the procedures of photography and the appropriation of historically charged images from the media, as is evidenced in the nudes of Gerhard Richter or Marlene Dumas. These are juxtaposed with depictions of bodies by artists such as Otto Steinert or Helmut Newton, which reflect the aesthetics of their age in distilled form. The motif of the Ecce Homo also recurs through the centuries in numerous, fragmentary variants - from Durer's Sebastian through to the exposed body of the model Kristen McMenamy - inspiring photographers from Helmut Newton to Juergen Teller.\nPhotographic vision is comparative vision. In keeping with this, Annette Kicken has cast her own, comparative eye on the diverse Olbricht Collection, identifying items that fit together to form a series of motifs, subject matter, gestures and artefacts that evoke sympathetic reverberations through their overlaps and analogies. They demonstrate how the most divergent things can enter into a relationship with one another. It's just a matter of finding the right moment.",

In a tense political and cultural climate, cultural institutions have to tinker, adapt themselves and take special measures to pursue their mission. In these situations, the pragmatism they must show is considered as a survival strategy in art and as a way of resistance. If the works of the three collections dialogue from a conceptual, stylistic and/or anecdotal point of view, it is above all the pragmatics associated with the constraints of the exhibition that guides their intermingling in a desire for efficiency.",

    "description": "This exhibition explores the ways in which these factors manifest in and around the body, and offers processes of identification, awareness and visibility as possible paths to deflate such urgencies. In presenting a constellation of works that investigate fluctuating identities and vulnerabilities, \"I See You\" offers a rich reading in regard to the limits and functions of the body.\nFeatured in the Pamela Elaine Poetter Gallery, the exhibition invites viewers to explore groupings of sculpture, installation, two-dimensional works and a rich selection of film. The exhibition's title emphasizes a reciprocal mode of the gaze, or the active way in which viewers look upon representations of another's body. In turn, the act of seeing another serves as a participatory action and acknowledges the artist's subjective perspective.\nThe exhibition uses contemporary artwork as well as historical pieces from the museum's permanent collection to explore the impact of social stressors on the human body. This includes selected works from the Walter O. Evans Collection of African American Art by artists of varying backgrounds who operated within and against oppressive social systems. Additionally, contemporary artists both conceal and reveal by utilizing fragmented or imagined bodies in their work. The incomplete body's essence is challenged through impermanence, metamorphosis or allusion of skin through unexpected material. Through their representations of and investigations into the human form, these artists offer reflections of their own identities and those apart from their own.\n\"I See You\" uses the notion of the post-human body, one that is no longer pure, whole or self-contained, but instead is constantly in transit, colonized, dispossessed or even dematerialized. From this perspective, the presented works offer multifaceted renderings of the body related to specific notions of intersectionality.",

    "description": "\"Walking ... is how the body measures itself against the earth.\"*\nThe artists in this exhibition stage encounters between the earth and the body--the primary tool at their disposal--to understand the land and their relationship to it. Ranging from physical interventions in the ground to conceptual documentations of travel and labor, their divergent practices reject a totalizing or objective view of the landscape, instead favoring embodied investigations of specific places, histories, and ideals. In the process, the artists recognize land \"not as scenery, but as the spaces and systems we inhabit, a system our own lives depend upon.\" (Rebecca Solnit, As Eve Said to the Serpent: On Landscape, Gender, and Art, 47.)\nTitled after a quote from ecofeminist author and critic Rebecca Solnit, a body measured against the earth is drawn largely from the MCA's collection. It takes inspiration from the ephemeral \"earth-body\" works staged by Cuban-American artist Ana Mendieta in the 1970s and weaves legacies of land art and \"walking art\" with more recent work in conceptual photography and the moving image.\n*Rebecca Solnit, Wanderlust: A History of Walking (New York: Penguin, 2001), 31.",

    "description": "Singapore, September 2018 - ShanghART Singapore is pleased to show Trying to Remember a Tree (iii) - The world will surely collapse, a special outdoor light box installation by Singaporean artist Robert Zhao Renhui, presented in conjunction with Gillman Barracks' 6th Anniversary x Art After Dark. The work is a series of 14 near life-size photographs, featuring a very old and large tree that collapsed near the artist's home. In Singapore, trees are cut in sections to make their removal easier. The physical cuts by which the tree is sectioned echo but do not exactly correspond to how Zhao has edited and sequenced the images, suggesting that there might be different ways of \"managing\" nature, whether via park authorities or art. Placed in a natural environment with the forest serving as its backdrop, the lush greenery of Gillman Barrack's forest and the bleakness of the monochrome artwork form a stark contrast, provoking viewers to reflect on the state of the natural environment in the present day.\nThis work was first presented at JIWA: Jakarta Biennale (2017), supported by the National Arts Council of Singapore and ShanghART Gallery.",

    "description": "Wilfried Lentz Rotterdam is pleased to present T, an exhibition of key collaborative works by Rossella Biscotti (b. Molfetta, IT, 1978) and Kevin van Braak (b. Warnsveld, NL, 1975).\nThe opening will take place Sunday, September 9th. Open the whole afternoon from 1-7pm. Reception from 5-7pm.\nThe show runs until November 4th and will be extended solely at our 2nd floor space. For more information or images, contact the gallery: office@wilfriedlentz.com, +31(0)104126459.\nFeaturing The Library (2010) and After Four Rotations of A, B Will Make One Revolution (2009-ongoing), the exhibition T  looks at the ideological re-formulation of post-soviet nations, and how this process may be represented in the transformations of works of art and literature from that era.\nThe Library is a welded steel structure filled with hunderds of Soviet-era books, all de-accessioned by the University Library of Vilnius in 2008. In this permeable but cage-like space, the many works of literature-selected by the artists from among thousands being disposed-give a picture of the ideological 'prison' written into society across fields of economic, political, philosophical, legal and sociological thought. Accompanying screenprints list the English translations of the title of each book withdrawn from the University Library's collection and presented here.\nIn the series After Four Rotations of A, B Will Make One Revolution, a joint project that the artists have conducted for almost a decade, Biscotti and van Braak reconstruct existing figuative sculptures in minimalist form-a 'reductive' operation that further complicates questions of how history is told in sculpture. Portraits of Soviet political figures, such as Lenin, Stakhanov and Tito, are re-presented by sculptures of the same material, weight, and name, but in condensed and abstract shape. The simple forms, and their process of casting, point to the practice of destroying of such politically charged statues at the end of the regimes they stand for.\nParticularly of note is the seven-part portrait of Josip Broz Tito, based on busts by Yugoslav artist Antun Augustincic (1900-1979). Augustincic's works were discovered by Belgrade-based artist Dragan Srdic (b. Belgrade, 1958), who presented them in his own work in 2000. Here, Biscotti and van Braak acknowledge Srdic's work, and the role of art in the mediation of national histories and identities.\nExpanded versions of the exhibition T were previously presented at the Museum of Contemporary Art Belgrade, Serbia and Skuc Gallery, Ljubljiana, Slovenia; curated by Zoran Eric and Vladimir Vidmar.\nAlongside their respective individual practices, Biscotti & van Braak have worked collaboratively since 2004. They will present a major new installation, The Standing Wave for Steirischer Herbst in Graz (AT), September 20th - October 14th.",

    "description": "Opening Saturday, December 1st from 4pm to 8pm\nThe practice of Pak Sheung Chuen (born in 1977) often deals with and reflects upon the contradicting absurdness and ordinariness of everyday life in a poetic and humorous nature, thus creating a critical yet poignant sentiment for its viewers.His work often reflects upon contemporary Hong Kong through personal observations and conceptual engagement with everyday life in the city and on the conflict between an ideal world and reality, which he tries to address with poetic solutions that strive to merge both worlds.\nAfter two solo shows at Para Site, Hong Kong and Vitamin Creative Space, Guangzhou, this exhibition shows the latest developments of a process of self-healing after the failure of the Umbrella Movement, a civil-desobedience movement which took over the downtown streets of Hong Kong in the end of 2014. Attending specific cases about political activists who were being prosecuted by the government, Pak Sheung Chuen made automatic drawings during the trials. These drawings acted as a starting point for these series of works, which addresses the relationship between state power and the individual in a situation where freedom of speech is under pressure.",

    "description": "Superflex: We Are All In The Same Boat\n\tThe first museum survey of the critically acclaimed Danish collective SUPERFLEX in the United States, this exhibition focuses on the group's humorous and playfully subversive installations and films, which address the economy, financial crisis, corruption, migration, and the possible consequences of global warming. The exhibition's title envisions passengers together in a ship at sea, and a set of shared risks that may put them in danger. Our own collective danger implies a collective responsibility and a need to collaborate so that our ship does not capsize.\n \tIncreasingly during the last two decades, global warming and climate change have been discussed and debated, and the consequences of human impact, interference, and possible triggering of the twenty-first century's climate changes have recently echoed within the art world in a more activist way. Art has always responded to issues in the real world, and SUPERFLEX has been at the forefront of artists who grapple with many of these pressing subjects. SUPERFLEX was founded by Bjornstjerne Christiansen, Jakob Fenger, and Rasmus Nielsen in 1993, and since then the three artists have gained international recognition for their DIY and activist approaches.\n \tWe Are All in the Same Boat  includes a group of videos, sculptures, and installations selected for their relevance to the history, present, and future of the City of Miami. The works reflect upon the position of Miami from the perspectives of art, finance, climate, and a fictional, if plausible, future. The topics of water, migration, refugees, and the economy inevitably drive the conception of the exhibition. We Are All in the Same Boat includes the American debut of a number of the works in the show, several of which have been newly reimagined for our city.\n \tSUPERFLEX is known for its interest in unifying urban spaces and commenting on society through art. The artists describe their practice as providing \"tools\" that affect or influence a social or economic situation. The group often roots its projects in their particular local contexts and outside of traditional art contexts, collaborating with designers, engineers, businesses, and marketers on projects that have the potential for social or economic change. The projects remain difficult to pigeonhole, yet innovative in their approaches to current issues.\n \tThe members of SUPERFLEX have used their position as artists to pose questions of political, economic, and environmental behavior and responsibility. In the words of the exhibition's curator, SUPERFLEX's \"works are meant to create political awareness, generate discussions, and help us think and act.\"\n \tOrganized by MOAD, SUPERFLEX: We Are All in the Same Boat is curated by Jacob Fabricius, Artistic Director of Kunsthal Aarhus. Support for SUPERFLEX: We Are All in the Same Boat is provided by the Miami-Dade County Department of Cultural Affairs, this.nordic, Funding Arts Network, the Danish Arts Foundation, and the Florida Department of State Division of Cultural Affairs.",

    "description": "One Two Three Swing! challenges society's apathy towards the political, environmental and economic crises of our age. The installation is experienced in three states: apathy, production and movement. The state of apathy compromises a large pendulum suspended by a 20 metre cable from ceiling and swinging above a 770 square metre carpet in a colour scheme inspired by bank notes. Occupying the far end of the hall is the state of production, a factory station where swing seats are assembled, stamped and stored prior to distribution and use. Emerging from the state of production, an orange line formed of sets of interconnected, three-seated swings invite and frame the movements of users.\nThe act of resting in contemplation with the hypnotic pendulum above is set in contrast to the liberating, collaborative experience of swinging together. Over time the work will evolve as the orange line continues to grow and new swings are added into the wider world.",

    "description": "Private View 8 November 6 - 8 pm\nWe are delighted to announce an exhibition celebrating 50 years since the gallery's establishment as Annely Juda Fine Art in 1968. The exhibition will feature works by a selection of 50 artists who are either represented by or who have shown at the gallery. The exhibition marks the rich history of the gallery, which has been a stalwart and influential space for artists and visitors since its opening by Annely Juda and her son David Juda in Tottenham Mews, central London. \nAnnely Juda had already established the Molton Gallery (1960 - 1963) and then the Hamilton Galleries (1963 - 1967) in London before opening Annely Juda Fine Art with David Juda on 16thJune 1968 with 'Now Open: Important Paintings of the 20thCentury and Young Artists'. This marrying of the twentieth-century avant-garde and contemporary art has carried on throughout the gallery's history.  \nThe gallery became known for exhibiting works of Russian Constructivism, Bauhaus and De Stijl showing artists such as Kandinksy, Malevich, Mondrian, Tatlin, Gabo, Lissitzky and Rodchenko, something which was rare at the time in England. Adopting the title Moholy-Nagy gave to his 1927 Bauhaus book of Malevich texts and illustrations, the gallery presented the first of many exhibitions devoted to abstract art titled 'The Non-Objective World' in 1970. As Norbert Lynton states, \"with the Non-Objective World shows, Annely opened up, intensified and reshaped areas of modern art history little touched at that time by scholars, curators and collectors...\"[1]\nThe gallery has always shown and represented contemporary artists along with its historical program, partnering with the contemporary program of Rowan Gallery between 1982-1985. Stong relationships with Japan lead to the showing of Japanese artists of distinction such as Yoshishige Saito, Kazuo Shiraga, Katsuhiro Yamaguchi, Tadashi Kawamata and Yuko Shiraishi. Key British artists have always been central to the gallery's program and long-standing represented artists include David Hockney, Leon Kossoff, Nigel Hall, David Nash, Alan Charlton, Alan Green and the Estates of Anthony Caro and Prunella Clough. International represented artists include Francois Morellet, Edda Renouf and Sarah Oppenheimer. A friendship stemming from the 1960's between David Juda and Christo and Jeanne-Claude lead to the the artists' first gallery exhibition in London in 1971. \nIn 1990, the gallery moved to its current location at 23 Dering Street off New Bond Street in London's Mayfair and remains under the directorship of David Juda. It is obviously impossible to cover the breadth of the 342 exhibitions held at the gallery over its 50 years, however, this exhibition celebrates a slice of the gallery's history by showing a selection of works by represented and exhibited artists. \nA full list of artists in the exhibition is as follows: Roger Ackling, Max Bill, Anthony Caro, Alan Charlton, Eduardo Chillida, Christo, Prunella Clough, Alexandra Exter, Lesley Foxcroft, Gloria Friedmann, Katsura Funakoshi, Naum Gabo, Stefan Gec, Sheila Girling, Philipp Goldbach, Alan Green, June Green, Nigel Hall, Werner Haypeter, David Hockney, Sigrid Holmwood, Peter Kalkhof, Tadashi Kawamata, Gustav Klucis, Leon Kossoff, Edwina Leapman, Catherine Lee, Kasimir Malevich, Kenneth Martin, Mary Martin, John McLaughlin, Michael Michaeledes, Laszlo Moholy-Nagy, Francois Morellet, David Nash, Lucia Nogueira, Sarah Oppenheimer, Liubov Popova, Edda Renouf, Alan Reynolds, Alexander Rodchenko, Yoshishige Saito, Kazuo Shiraga, Yuko Shiraishi, Suzanne Treister, Lun Tuchnowski, Georges Vantongerloo, Friedrich Vordemberge- Gildewart, Graham Williams, Katsuhiro Yamaguchi.\nAnnely Juda: Born Anneliese Brauer in Kassel, Germany in 1914 * Left Germany in 1934 for Israel, later moving to London in 1939 * Worked as a single mother in various jobs before becoming Secretary to art collector Eric Estorick * Opened the Molton Gallery (1960 - 1963) and then the Hamilton Galleries (1963 - 1967) in London before opening Annely Juda Fine Art with David Juda in 1968 * Became known for exhibiting works from the Russian avant-garde along with contemporary artists * Known as the 'doyenne' of British Art Dealers * Made a CBE for services to the arts 1998 * Died August 13th 2006\nDavid Juda: Born 1946 in London * Joined his mother Annely Juda in the running of Annely Juda Fine Art in 1968 and remains Director to present day * Member of Executive Committee Society of London Art Dealers, Vice-Chairman 1986-90 and 1995-2001, Chairman 2014-2017 * Honorary Doctorate from Norwich University of the Arts 2012\n[1] Norbert Lynton, Art Historian and Critic, March 2007.

    "description": "From October 13, 2018 to April 4, 2019, UCCA presents \"After Nature,\" the inaugural exhibition at the UCCA Dune Art Museum, the newest addition to UCCA's growing portfolio of projects. Included are works by nine Chinese artists who span a range of generations, born between 1942 and 1988. The works on display, by Li Shan, Liang Shaoji, Liu Yujia, Nabuqi, Yang Xinguang, Trevor Yeung, Yu Ji, Zheng Bo, and Zhuang Hui & Dan'er, engage with the question of how humanity discovered--and in some ways invented--the natural world, a question given increased urgency by the release of a United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report this week forecasting climate-induced crises before 2040 if carbon emissions continue at current levels. The exhibition is specifically devised for the singular spaces of UCCA Dune Art Museum, a subterranean building designed by Li Hu and Huang Wenqing of OPEN Architecture, located under a sand dune on a beach in the Aranya Gold Coast Community, 300 kilometers from Beijing. Organized by UCCA curator Luan Shixuan, the exhibition creates a dialogue among the works, the cell-like galleries that house them, the surrounding sand, and the rising sea just beyond.\nThe title \"After Nature\" denotes changes in both the physical environment and human conceptions of it. Sustained human encroachment has permanently transformed the environment, leading many scholars to declare an entirely new geological era, the Anthropocene. The Romantic idea of nature as unspoiled wilderness--always ideologically fraught, even spurious--is no longer tenable. With this comes the realization that nature is not a holistic entity, or some secular providence, but simply the multiple, overlapping worlds fashioned by the billions of beings--living and non-living, organic and non-organic--that reside on this earth. Works in the exhibition testify to this strange insight. They evoke received notions of nature such as scenic mountains, green plants, and flowing rivers, only to have them morph seamlessly into \"artificial\" elements like liquid crystal, plastic, and inkjet printing. Taken together, the artists and works ask viewers to rethink nature, rather than to do away with it; to imagine a new ecology that sees humans and objects in close proximity, mutually influencing and influenced, ineluctably entangled.\nExhibited Works\nThree works by Li Shan (b. 1942, Heilongjiang Province) deal with bioengineering: the prints Scribble 2 and Scribble 3 depict strange, organic hybrids of corn, decomposed leaves, and other organic material, while his film Misfortune centers on a dragonfly-human hybrid, roving across the world where an ecological disaster--with its attendant genetic mutations--seems to have already occurred.\nMoon Garden by Liang Shaoji (b. 1945, Shanghai) continues the artist's engagement with the life cycle of silkworms. A frame of acrylic and steel is covered in silk and cocoons, testifying to the ways in which actors--human and animal--engineer the places we inhabit. Alongside the installation, a film documents the silkworms spinning on this installation. Buried in the sand, itself taken from the surrounding area, are fragments of daggers, scimitars, and mirrors, which, along with the stele-like monument, evoke the rise and fall of ancient Mesopotamian civilizations, as well as the region's present-day turmoil.\nThe exhibition includes two films by Liu Yujia (b. 1981, Sichuan Province). Black Ocean is inspired by Italo Calvino's Invisible Cities, which follows an imaginary dialogue between to Marco Polo and Kublai Khan on a series of fantastical cities. Wave transforms aerial footage of beaches into a mesmerizing, digital diptych. These abstracted, aestheticized images of nature both contrast and resonate with the liquid crystal display screens that make them visible, seemingly pointing to an uncanny synthesis of two forms of liquidity.\nDestination by Nabuqi (b. 1984, Inner Mongolia Province) juxtaposes \"fake\" plants with an image of a scenic beachside getaway, reminiscent of a billboard. The work reminds viewers of the dunes and sea outside the building, effacing the differences between interior and exterior by showing how artwork and environment are both shaped by human hands.\nMountains by Yang Xinguang (b. 1980, Hunan Province) is a collection of small, concrete hills. Yang is interested in the symbiosis between organic and synthetic materials. Here, it is concrete, a quintessential urban material, that is modeled into hills, revealing the sand, water, and gravel that have comprised it all along.\nMonochrome prints of an acanthus tree by Trevor Yeung (b. 1988, Guangdong Province) pose the question: what becomes of the plant in the age of mechanical reproduction? The acanthus provides an ironic case study--a plant replicated in European art and architecture for thousands of years and disseminated around the world via colonial encroachment, yet which few people have seen in person. Yeung's works Island 5050 and Island 6090, meanwhile, are \"2.5-dimensional\" sculptures: both are prints of bodies of water, stuck to pieces of real pumice.\nTa Jama - Green Hair Monster by Yu Ji (b. 1985, Shanghai) is an exercise in naming. What appear to be small boulders overgrown with moss are actually made of reinforced concrete. Reminiscent of a Chinese garden, the work reflects Yu's interest in the many roles the figure of the stone plays in different civilizations and religions. The sleight-of-hand substitution of manmade for natural material, and the imitative, speculative quality of the work, only further blur the distinction between the natural and artificial.\nDune Botanical Garden by Zheng Bo (b. 1974, Beijing) takes the psammophyte--a plant that is uniquely adapted to living in shifting sands with its roots uncovered--and situates it within the environment of UCCA Dune. By transplanting a garden into a museum, Bo seeks to shift the definition of art from something \"manmade\" to something made by all living things.\nThe \"Leftover Material from the Carpenters\" series, by Zhuang Hui (b. 1963, Gansu Province) and Dan'er (b. 1983, Shaanxi Province) gives viewers a sense of the radical power of framing. These painstakingly crafted sculptures look like wooden odds and ends left over from a carpentry project. Yet composed of copper and acrylic--materials that are cast, not carved--they complicate the easy binaries between artist and artisan, carpenter and conceptualist.\nAbout UCCA Dune\nUCCA Dune is an art museum buried under a sand dune by the Bohai Sea in Beidaihe, 300 kilometers east of Beijing. Designed by OPEN Architecture, its galleries unfold over a series of cell-like spaces that evoke caves. Some are naturally lit from above, while others open out onto the beach. As a branch of UCCA, China's leading independent institution of contemporary art, it presents rotating exhibitions in dialogue with its particular site and space. UCCA Dune is built and supported by UCCA strategic partner Aranya, and located within the Aranya Gold Coast Community.",
