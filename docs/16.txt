 Both Head-Portrait with Red and Blue Background and Man with Blue Tie are classic examples of Weeks deftness of line, shape, and color. These two works illustrate his signature flattened style -a vast departure from figurative painting of the time- and hints of influence from modernist painters like Henri Matisse and Maynard Dixon, although with a somewhat darker tone. Both figures stare with with expressionless faces and hollow eyes. Weeks provides us with little visual information to distinguish the identities of these men. Are politicians, members of the jazz club scene that Weeks often depicted, or simply acquaintances that agreed to sit for him? Head-Portrait with Red and Blue Background and Man with Blue Tie are interesting examples of the Bay Area figurative painting movement in their contrast to the sunny landscapes of Elmer Bischoff and the abstract or non-objective works of Richard Diebenkorn.
