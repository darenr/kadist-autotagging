 In  Onde quer que voce esteja  (2011) Accinelli sets up a row of cardboard shipping tubes of varying heights and inscribes on them in black ink the words of the title, which translates in English as “Wherever you may be.” The words, while legible, seem like fragmented lines and shapes—almost but not quite a deconstruction of the text. Accinelli explores the relationship between objects as metaphors of their own materiality and as tools for conveying ideas.
