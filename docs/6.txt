URVANITY is the only fair in Spain, dedicated to the New Contemporary Art, which advocates proposals (with a strong base in the urban context of the 1970’s up until today) that construct a dialogue with modernity, and, as a result, provide a setting from which we can explain the world around us. “The so called New Contemporary Art refers to the artists that started off in the streets with graffities or murals, and that transferred this art to galleries and so to the art market.”, states Sergio Sancho, director of the fair.
