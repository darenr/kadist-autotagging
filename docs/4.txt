 Brenna Youngblood’s chromogenic print  Red Door  (2007) is representative of the artist’s interest in conceptual photography; she also works in multimedia collage and assemblage, drawing imagery from the everyday and giving new meanings to seemingly mundane objects and places. The image of a red door inspires a tension between potential meaning and purposeful ambiguity, leaving the viewer to wonder about her formal decisions. The color red on a door is often used to symbolize good luck, and in almost every culture, means welcome. Some say a red door was a sign of a safe house on the Underground Railroad.
