  Untitled (rolled up) , is an abstract portrait of Owen Monk, the artists father and features an aluminum ring of 56.6 cm in diameter measuring 1.77 cm in circumference, the size of his father. Jonathan Monk bridges a conceptual art and his family privacy, and ironically ensures that there is no difference between Sol Lewitt and my mother, he does not know more than she do not know.  What is the status of the O-backed chair rail to the white cube? Monk gives us some clues. The O is an initial, the letter contains the first letter of Owen. The O is also a sign, the letter contains the restaurant sign Owen. The O of  Untitled (rolled up)  is thought of as an encrypted letter. The work, while it appears as a joke (?), plays upon everything. Monk questions the meaning of a work through non-conventional logic.
