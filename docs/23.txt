 For this floor based work, Gomes has taken two lengths of bamboo and tied them together using linen thread. The work is self-supporting and stands in a crack or a hole in the floor. The work suggests precariousness, frailty as well as humanity through its verticality, and its gentle sinuous form, referencing perhaps the work of Giacometti. Other works in the exhibition recalled the work of Mondrian with an emphasis on horizontal and vertical lines. The fact that this work deviates from an emphasis on the rectilinear should be seen within the context of Gomesâ€™s constructivist routes and her interest in Arte Povera. Allowing the material to express its own inner nature is fundamental to her work. The modest nature of her art suggests a poetics of the immaterial. The standing sculpture, modest though it may be, articulates the space of the room, suggesting a near and a far. Gomes generally makes her work in situ, responding to the space the exhibition will occupy, the gallery thus becoming an extension of her studio.
