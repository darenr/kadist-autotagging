 In four-channel video Island, a series of objects such as nail clippers, hairbrush, toothpaste, and house decorations are displayed with close-up shoots. Images are rendered in a highly polished and aesthetic manner, creating poetic visual ?ows. In front of each object, however, lies a coin, ranging from 2 Yuan, to 1 Pound, to 1 Euro or 1 Dollar, silently revealing the material value of these household supplies. Underneath elegant surface there is a deep sense of critical irony, elaborating by the contradictory nature of the cheap plastic items and their sophistic visual interpretation. Kan poignantly and metaphorically comments on the economic and production structure of todayâ€™s global market. The most in?uential visual spectacles can be generated by the most basic elements in the everyday.
