  Wild Boy   is the story of the education of Amir, the artists son. Ben-Ner plays the educators part, trying to domesticate the child. Using the metaphor of the wild child is Ben-Ners homage to this recurring theme in literature and cinema: from Edgar Rice Burroughs « Tarzan » to Truffauts « Lenfant sauvage », and Rudyard Kiplings « Jungle book ». The video is an attempt at capturing this decisive moment when the child lets go of its wilderness to become « civilized », and raises the nature/culture dichotomy, dear to the Enlightenment philosophers.
