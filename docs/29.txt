 In Anthony Discenza’s 23-minute audio loop that makes up A Rising Tide Lifts All Boats (2012), a nondescript male voice narrates a series of unlikely pairings: “think Dune meets South Pacific;” “think dubstep meets the Magna Carta;” “think the Food Network meets Igmar Bergman.” Given without inflection or emotion, this recitation uses the structure of a Hollywood elevator pitch to sketch out an unknown project, idea, or structure, conflating and collapsing cultural referents into an implausible mass of contradictions.
