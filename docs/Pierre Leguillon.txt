 End of 2008, Pierre Leguillon presented at Kadist Art Foundation the first retrospective of the works of Diane Arbus (1923-1971) organized in France since 1980, bringing together all the images commissioned to the New York photographer by the Anglo-American press in the 1960s. This exhibition, destined to tour in various locations, presents the original pages of the magazines, including Harpers Bazaar, Esquire, Nova and The Sunday Times Magazine. As Pierre Leguillon states on the exhbitions publication: The mythology surrounding Diane Arbus character is willingly set aside to offer a more neutral point of view on a more unfamiliar part of her work, although it was mass-distributed. Many of the characters portrayed in these commissioned works seem less sensational at first glance than the freaks that made Diane Arbus work so famous, since the retrospective MOMA organized in 1973 in New York, two years after her suicide. And yet, leafing through all her contributions for the press, the Diane Arbus method, her installing the model in an environment in such a particular way, emerges obviously. Long sitting sessions, sometimes repeated, were destined to allow the model to « let go », while he never stopped fixing the camera, straight forward. It is no doubt their rigorous construction that enables these images, still today, to be contemporary.
