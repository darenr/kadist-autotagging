Ghosts on the roof: Conversations about art, fossils, and spectra, with Víctor Costales and art historian, Ana María Risco

The conversation between Víctor Costales of the artistic duo Rometti Costales and art historian, Ana María Risco will reflect on the artists’ intervention on the site of the Museo de la Solidaridad Salvador Allende (MSSA), for the exhibition Song for a chanting fossil (Canción para un fósil canoro). The discussion will touch upon their explorations into the multiple transformations of the building that houses the MSSA today, and the processes of fossilization and petrification of human and mineral remains in the Atacama Desert, metaphors on the frailties of the human, and the nature and political history of Chile. This event is moderated by Daniela Berger, Programming Coordinator, Museo de la Solidaridad Salvador Allende (MSSA)

Rometti Costales, Song for a chanting fossil is a collaboration with Museo de la Solidaridad Salvador Allende (MSSA) and a commission for The Missing Circle curated by Magalí Arriola.
