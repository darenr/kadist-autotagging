  Tourisme International  was shot as the recording of a show on the scale of a country. In the urgency of perpetual travel, this tourist journey visits monuments, museums, institutions presented by North Korean guides whose voices we do not hear. Marie Voignier entirely redesigned the sound of each sequence in post-synchronization, making only the living experiences of footsteps and rustling of clothes audible, to create a new universe, disconnected from the official discourses. In this new decor, the artist attempts to re-appropriate the image she shot (frames and length were decided by the organizers), and gives another view of a country in perpetual representation of itself: a cinematographic representation that can be screened.
