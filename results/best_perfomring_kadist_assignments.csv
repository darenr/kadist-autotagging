Nora Schultz,"Halfway between a painting and an installation City Sound of Rug gathers found images, synthetic foam, painted metal plates, and prints placed on the floor. Rugs are elements representative of commerce and related to the idea of territory, handicraft and community. In City Sound of Rug, the rugs are used as surfaces upon which prints are manually made. The traces of paint on the synthetic foam and the paint transfers from one rug to another, enable the spectator to see the materials used as tools, elements that constitute the structure of the installation. City Sound of Rug also incorporates advertising billboards of real estate projects. The work focuses on architecture and urbanism. The use of color is essential in this work: the blue, red and green marks become signs and characterize the work like an act of speech.","Born 1975, Frankfurt / Main, Germany   Lives and works in Berlin  Nora Schulz explores the relations between painting, sculpture, performance, and language. She tends to capture the moment where forms become signs and elements of language. She is interested in translation and in the shifts that occur when external realities and cultural patterns are readapted. She mainly works with industrial materials that she collects in the surroundings of her studio in Berlin (metal of all sorts, rugs, shafts, tubes, ropes). Process and shifting are the bases of her practice which concerns transformation within each context. She remodels found objects into abstract sculpted paintings characterized by precarious balance. Her sculptures often end up taking the shape of printing machines, questioning language and the authority of its grammatical forms in an active process of materialisation.",City Song of Rug,Europe,"['sound.n.01', 'print.n.01', 'paint.n.01', 'city.n.01', 'elements.n.01', 'billboard.n.01', 'blue.n.01', 'metallic_element.n.01', 'district.n.01', 'address.n.03', 'trace.n.01', 'representative.s.01', 'red.s.01', 'floor.n.01', 'tool.n.01', 'community.n.01', 'architecture.n.01', 'sign.n.01', 'surface.n.01', 'color.n.01', 'structure.n.01', 'real.a.01', 'undertaking.n.01', 'idea.n.01', 'spectator.n.01']","['territory.n.03', 'tool.n.01', 'commerce.n.01', 'architecture.n.01', 'find.v.01', 'handicraft.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/46966992230492243169.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/46966992230492243169-300x225.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/city-song-rug/,"['Society/7.793250377073906', 'Cultural/7.611222910216718', 'Material_Physical/7.3267399267399265']","['Society', 'Cultural', 'Material_Physical']",22.73121321403055,"['Land/6.564835164835164', 'Economy/5.424019607843137', 'Arts/4.322058823529412']","['Land', 'Economy', 'Arts']",16.310913596207712,"['Cultural/28.97325468648999', 'Society/27.782778496013794', 'Individual_Personal/18.239907460960097']","['Cultural', 'Society', 'Individual_Personal']",74.99594064346388,"['Urbanization/15.502650290885587', 'Arts/10.756404869640164', 'Land/9.94425052072111']","['Urbanization', 'Arts', 'Land']",36.20330568124686,0.6666666666666666,0.6666666666666666
Paul Czerlitzki,"In this painting made in 2014, which is part of a series started in 2013, the artist dismantles the traditional painting process. Putting aside any formal intervention, the artist lets the membrane slowly soak up white monochrome paint through a transferring technique before removing it. In some places the structure of the canvas can be seen, while other places of the canvas are purposely blurred to evoke the texture of the material used. Although the artist’s actions can seem surprisingly simple, they express an intellectual potential and a visual complexity that allow the spectators, if not force them, to perceive the work in a clear, definite and slow way.","Born 1986 in Danzig, Pologne Lives and works in Düsseldorf and Paris   Paul Czerlitzki’s work takes part in a reflection on painting and its material components. “The artist has therefore selected a methodological process with which he can repeatedly renegotiate, discover and critically examine painting’s material preconditions, i.e., the frame, the canvas and paint, and the objective, namely, to produce a (panel) painting. He dismantles existing orders by using the canvas as a membrane through which to apply or press colours. He also positions the canvas in relation to the space, as in an installation, or else removes it from the frame and mounts it again slightly off.” (Suzanne Friedli and Elisabeth Gerber)",Ohne Tittle,Europe,"['technique.n.01', 'perceive.v.01', 'intervention.n.01', 'complexity.n.01', 'potential.n.01', 'paint.n.01', 'traditional.a.01', 'formal.a.01', 'simple.a.01', 'structure.n.01', 'action.n.01', 'white.a.01', 'procedure.n.01', 'ocular.a.02', 'spectator.n.01', 'material.n.01', 'series.n.01']","['soak.n.01', 'slow.a.02', 'membrane.n.01', 'painting.n.01', 'procedure.n.01', 'nontraditional.a.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/paul-czerlitzki-st-2013.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/paul-czerlitzki-st-2013-197x300.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/ohne-tittle/,"['Cultural/12.476062989298287', 'Society/7.2835164835164825', 'Material_Physical/4.24174538911381']","['Cultural', 'Society', 'Material_Physical']",24.00132486192858,"['Arts/6.845537958773253', 'Spirituality/3.257142857142857', 'Culture/2.4349206349206347']","['Arts', 'Spirituality', 'Culture']",12.537601450836744,"['Cultural/21.506349206349213', 'Society/17.03553113553114', 'Politics/13.768584356819654']","['Cultural', 'Society', 'Politics']",52.31046469870001,"['Arts/7.255311355311355', 'Economy/5.598168498168498', 'Spirituality/4.795604395604395']","['Arts', 'Economy', 'Spirituality']",17.64908424908425,0.6666666666666666,0.6666666666666666
Köken Ergun,"The Battle of Karbala was a military engagement that took place on 10 Muharram, 61 AH (October 10th, 680) in Karbala, situated in present day Iraq, when Hussein, the grandson of the prophet Muhammad, was killed. This battle is central to Shia Muslim belief in which Hussein’s martyrdom is commemorated each year, in a celebration called Ashura which symbolises the birth of Muslim division still at issue today between the Shia and Sunni. During Ashura, the artist worked in close collaboration with the people of Zeynebiye (referring to Hussein’s courageous sister, Zeyneb), documenting their preparations for the ceremonies, which involve a mass theatre performance and the isolated, weeping ritual at the end of the Ashura day. What in other countries is celebrated through a collective performance of blood and pain is experienced here through a highly theatrical and emotional day, presenting Islam as the practice of a culture rather than politics. Ergun attempts to question the cultural importance of religions against a “radical secularism” that has ruled Turkey until now.","Born in Istanbul, in 1976, Köken Ergun studied acting and worked with the American theatre director Robert Wilson. He then became interested in contemporary art, especially video and performance.

Kiran Subbaiah,"Flight Rehearsals focuses on Subbaiah’s desire to fly as a means to highlight the relationship between human ambition and limitations of the physical world. The video presents philosophical explorations of the human desire to defy gravity and time. The minimalist set of a table highlights the intention and persistence of the protagonist rather than technological innovation. The video manipulates the camera angle to distort the appearance of space so that Subbaiah’s repeated attempts at beating gravity can achieve momentary flights. As the flight attempts move into the bedroom, what first appears to be a close up of an alarm clock turns out to be an oversized ringing alarm clock further back to create a distortion of space through manipulations in scale. Such effects highlight both the proximity and distance between apparent success and distorted perception.","Born in Sidpur and living in Bangalore, Kiran Subbaiah works in a variety of media that includes assemblage, video and internet art after initial training as a sculptor. His works examine the relationships of use and value in everyday objects through subverting form and function. Constructing paradoxes through deadpan and humor, Subbaiah’s works also manipulate the object in an act of emancipation in order to highlight art’s autonomy from having to serve a purpose.

This project is multifaceted, always transforming into different forms and involving a series of collaborations: the first step took place as part of the “traveling curtains project”, which consisted in recuperating the curtains from the Carlton hotel before its demolition and sending them to different cities throughout the world where they would be subject to new interventions and transformations by artists, among whom Marwa Arsanios.  A video records the collecting of the curtains. The second step consisted in the transformation of the collected curtains, turned into fashionable clothing items.

Haig Aivazian,"This work is part of an ongoing project that looks at international sports competitions as a revealing element of nationalistic aspirations which present contradictions.  The starting point of this work was inspired by private companies which were responsible for the security of the Olympic Games in England and also supply equipment for immigrant detention camps and prisons.  This work questions the use of the stadiums other than for sports competitions. Reference is clearly made to the Vélodrome d’Hiver or the detention camps during the Vichy regime under Pinochet or the Talibans but also their requisition during natural disasters like after hurricane Katrina in New Orleans. The lighting creates a frame that obstructs the stadium with a luminous mass in suspension, creating a strange apparition in the darkness and a mixed feeling, between violence and fascination. The title comes from a short poem written by the artist that alludes to separation and distance. These blinding lights replace the moon light. The charcoal is used to create a contrast with this idea of light. This is what remains when the light has been fully consumed and all that is left are ashes. This work is the sequel of a video that dealt with the three adolescents that were electrocuted in Clichy-sous-Bois in 2005 and the protests that followed with the burning of cars.","Haig Aivazian was born in 1980 in Beirut. As an artist and curator he creates installations, drawings, sculpture and performances that connect a political reflection to biographical references.","At every sunset, I think of you.

Ming Wong,"Making Chinatown (2012) is a remake of Roman Polanski’s 1974 classic neo-noir film Chinatown. According to Wong, the latter is a “textbook” of Hollywood filmmaking. In Ming’s version, he plays all four main characters portrayed originally by Jack Nicholson, Faye Dunaway, John Huston, and Belinda Palmer, shooting against a backdrop of a film set reproduced as wallpaper in a gallery space. Presented as a seven-channel video installation, Making Chinatown is an immersive viewing experience with different scenarios, lines of conversation, and background music, all merged together into one space where the sense of time collapses. The ending fades to black with no reference of the original film’s site, precisely echoing the fictional nature of Chinatown as a no-place, constructed in an often-detached cultural context.","Ming Wong’s practice has a profound connection with world cinema. Constantly drawing from classic films, Wong investigates issues around identity, linguistics, translation, dislocation, and history through reenactments of well-known films. Often using a deliberately low-budget aesthetic, he restages the films by appropriating and recontextualizing the main storylines and characters. The compelling cultural imaginary created in his films brings forward and wittily satirizes the undermined codes that constitute the infrastructure of our society.",Making Chinatown,Unspecified,"['movie.n.01', 'version.n.01', 'hollywood.n.01', 'space.n.01', 'scenario.n.01', 'line.n.01', 'set.n.01', 'music.n.01', 'fictional.a.01', 'background.n.01', 'construct.v.01', 'original.s.01', 'mention.n.01', 'black.a.01', 'nature.n.01', 'sense.n.01', 'cultural.a.01', 'context.n.01', 'experience.n.01', 'fictional_character.n.01', 'time.n.01', 'video.n.01']","['reenactment.n.01', 'hollywood.n.01', 'dislocation.n.02', 'appropriation.n.03', 'film.n.02', 'narrative.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/14_-_makingofchinatown2.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/14_-_makingofchinatown2-300x168.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/making-chinatown/,"['Cultural/20.919933154221084', 'Society/5.668975468975469', 'Individual_Personal/4.804010025062657']","['Cultural', 'Society', 'Individual_Personal']",31.392918648259208,"['Media/7.445751633986927', 'Arts/6.589724310776942', 'Fantasy/1.9090909090909092']","['Media', 'Arts', 'Fantasy']",15.94456685385478,"['Cultural/17.030458593693893', 'Individual_Personal/8.910306686777275', 'Material_Physical/5.669455690508322']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Material_Physical']",31.61022097097949,"['Media/5.0970085470085476', 'Culture/4.230769230769231', 'Arts/3.657142857142857']","['Media', 'Culture', 'Arts']",12.984920634920636,0.6666666666666666,0.6666666666666666
"Jennifer Allora, Guillermo Calzadilla","This series of photographs is part of the body of work Allora & Calzadilla made regarding the situation in Vieques, an island off the mainland of Puerto Rico used for the 60 years by the U.S Military and NATO forces to practice military bombing exercises. In 2000, they began a collaboration with the local activists to make the campaign more visible. Having added cast rubber reliefs of their slogans and designs to the soles of their shoes, the activists stamped their protest on the reclaimed land. By slightly manipulating everyday objects to become communication tools, Allora & Calzadilla had created “mobile print-making machines” (Yates McKee, October 133, Summer 2010). They then photographed the ephemeral aftermath of these mark-making actions.  Like graffitied walls, the details of these impressions on sandy grounds are landscapes of dissent, willing the transition of propriety back to the inhabitants. In Land Mark #10, numerous footsteps with long statements stamp their resentment in different confused orientations. Such a beach scene might at first misleadingly be associated with a playful holiday snap. The fragility, uncertainty and relentlessness of this struggle is poetically summarized in this close-up of meaningful site-specific expression. The artists wrote: “How is land differentiated from other land by the way it is marked? Who decides what is worth preserving and what should be destroyed? What are the strategies for reclaiming marked land?

Tim Lee,"In the film Untitled (Buster Keaton, 1897) (2010), we see Tim Lee fall down a flight of stairs, referencing a pivotal story from Buster Keaton’s life: At the age of 18 months, he rolled down a flight of stairs, casually shrugged it off, and was then and there christened with the nickname “Buster” by Harry Houdini. Lee’s film is spliced together from multiple takes of him actually rolling his way up a staircase. Sped up and played in reverse in a continuous loop, it is convincingly Keaton-esque in its slapstick humor. Lee completes the effect by mounting the 16-millimeter projector on a specially constructed stepped sculpture.","Vancouver-based artist Tim Lee employs a wide range of media, including photography, video, installation, and performance to revisit and reinterpret—often humorously—particular historical moments through a constellation of references.","Untitled (Buster Keaton, 1897)",Americas,"['flight.n.01', 'multiple.a.01', 'play.v.01', 'age.n.01', 'movie.n.01', 'construct.v.01', 'narrative.n.01', 'sculpture.n.01', 'life.n.01']","['slapstick.n.01', 'impersonation.n.03', 'iconography.n.01', 'celebrity.n.01', 'reenactment.n.01', 'reinterpretation.n.02']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/tim_lee_untitled_buster_keaton.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/tim_lee_untitled_buster_keaton-300x297.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/untitled-buster-keaton-1897/,"['Cultural/19.319247874588438', 'Individual_Personal/7.165914786967418', 'Society/6.436363636363637']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Society']",32.92152629791949,"['Arts/10.402978033318591', 'Media/4.236904761904762', 'History/3.2363636363636363']","['Arts', 'Media', 'History']",17.876246431586992,"['Cultural/12.814763177998472', 'Material_Physical/4.213675213675214', 'Individual_Personal/3.4666666666666672']","['Cultural', 'Material_Physical', 'Individual_Personal']",20.495105058340354,"['Arts/6.800116713352007', 'Media/3.327777777777778', 'Materiality/2.435897435897436']","['Arts', 'Media', 'Materiality']",12.563791927027221,0.6666666666666666,0.6666666666666666

Ian Wallace,"Untitled (Breathless) presents a folded newspaper article on Jean-Luc Godard’s À Bout de Souffle (Breathless).

The black paper enacts a kind of cinematic “jump cut” on the article, while simultaneously drawing attention to the medium of the film, as well as the photograph reproduced in this newspaper article.

Jonas Staal,"Jonas Staal’s installation is based on the thesis written by Fleur Agema and titled “Closed Architecture”. The paper, written by the second most important person of Geert Wilderds’ Freedom Party, concerns an ambitious model for a new prison that focuses on the reconditioning of prisoners by means of four phases. Staal’s work is developed through a book, a plan and a 3d virtual tour in the social imagery of a current minister of the State of the Netherlands. Through this meticulous work by the artist the perspectives on political and architectural planning of a new right wing populist class of politicians is revealed and exposed through an analytic display.  As Jonas Staal points out: “This change in society requires more prisons since the entire society has become a model of detention: everyone is trapped in their own social conditions, whether poor or rich. Within the the debate on the representation of society and the society of control the work of Agema should be considered as a case study compared to the possibility of an open and democratic society, in which the interest common and political emancipation take center stage.”  For Staal, this model can be considered an ideological model in relation to how the Dutch society is now developing, with poor suburbs and gated communities under surveillance.","Jonas Staal ‘s work includes interventions in public spaces, exhibitions, lectures and publications. He interprets democracy – democratism – as a Gesamtkunstwerk (total work of art) from a Beuysian perspective.  Jonas Staal was born in 1981 in Holland.

Pascal Grandmaison,"Solo (2003) is a video exhibited as a video/sound installation depicting shots of drum, voice, guitar, clavier/synthesizer, and a melodica player cut into segmented fragments from the perspective of a studio recording set. Rather than deploying a narrative strategy, Grandmaison focuses on the gestures of the musicians and the repetitions they carry out when recording their individual tracks. The musicians are portrayed nodding, dancing, improvising, strumming, creating resonance that is repeated over and over– however, Grandmaison is sure not to document their entire faces or expressions while they perform, just details. Similar to that of a “jam,” close attention is granted to the exertion of the camera and how it portrays the framing of sequences. What one can pick up from the segments, especially those of voice recording, is a modified reworking of Anne Clark’s 1980’s track “Sleeper in the Metropolis.”","Marked by an apparent austerity and meticulousness, Pascal Grandmaison’s works display a disconcerting aloofness from the world, a clearly asserted detachment from reality. The subjects that interest the artist primarily deal with the means by which humans try to grasp their world, both visually and intellectually. The artist employs photography, video, and sculpture in order to compose a vision of what some have termed “troubling strangeness.” Overturning conventional codes of visual analysis, Grandmaison focuses on inanimate subjects that, once disassociated from their familiar environment, are re-contextualized through his cold gaze. His depictions do not exist as stories instead he reverses viewpoints and inverts color codes. His photographs and video works are generally black and white, giving them a monotone feel.

Apichatpong Weerasethakul,"Haunted Houses is a video in which villagers near Weerasethakul’s hometown of Khon Kaen were re-enact scenes from the popular Thai soap opera Tong Prakaisad. By encouraging villagers to play dramatic characters whose fates they had followed intimately, the video comments on the manner in which real experience and fantasy mediate and feed back to each other. Weerasethakul calls this phenomenon ‘medium addiction,’ a term describing a continual Thai fascination with spirits that dwell in a world parallel to everyday life. Critically aware of the mediums of film and video, Weerasetahkul’s works capture the manner through which traditional ways of mediating and perceiving the world is transcoded into new forms through new media. With filmed subjects entering television fantasies as easily as the television characters’ entering the living rooms and families of the viewers, Haunted Houses reflects the multiple other-worlds haunting the contemporary Thai consciousness in light of new communication technologies brought on by modern infrastructures, urban planning, and modern medicine.","Born in Bangkok, Thailand in July 1970, Apichatpong Weerasethakul is an independent filmmaker initially trained in architecture at Khon Kaen University. After receiving a Masters degree in filmmaking from the Art Institute of Chicago in 1997, Weerasethakul commenced a prodigious career in experimental cinema that awarded him the Jury Prize and Palm d’Or at the Cannes International Film Festival for Uncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives in 2010. As evidenced in feature length works such as Blissfully Yours, Tropical Malady, and Syndrome and a Century, Weerasethakul’s films are marked by interplays between organic, natural time and measured cinematic time while drawing from Buddhist narrative structures as well as science fiction themes.",Haunted Houses,Unspecified,"['television.n.01', 'medium.n.01', 'modern.a.01', 'house.n.01', 'manner.n.01', 'video.n.01', 'fictional_character.n.01', 'technology.n.01', 'phenomenon.n.01', 'consciousness.n.01', 'multiple.a.01', 'life.n.02', 'fantasy.n.01', 'bring.v.01', 'play.v.01', 'traditional.a.01', 'popular.a.01', 'family.n.01', 'urban.a.01', 'everyday.s.01', 'contemporary.s.01', 'real.a.01', 'light.n.01', 'experience.n.01', 'scene.n.01']","['modernity.n.01', 'thai.a.01', 'act.v.03', 'soap_opera.n.01', 'spirit.n.04', 'television.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/haunted_houses_02_copy.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/haunted_houses_02_copy-300x230.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/haunted-houses/,"['Individual_Personal/4.875', 'Cultural/4.390196078431373']","['Individual_Personal', 'Cultural']",9.265196078431373,"['Media/2.723529411764706', 'Spirituality/2.475', 'Mind/1.6']","['Media', 'Spirituality', 'Mind']",6.798529411764706,"['Cultural/34.780471162824114', 'Individual_Personal/15.958949220713928', 'Material_Physical/13.344425165477798']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Material_Physical']",64.08384554901583,"['Media/10.254638009049774', 'Arts/7.623432449903038', 'Mind/7.415158371040723']","['Media', 'Arts', 'Mind']",25.293228829993538,0.8,0.6666666666666666
Daria Martin,"Soft Materials is a curious, touching but also disturbing sequence of confrontations between two people: a man and a woman, and machines. Shot in the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory at the University of Zurich, the humans and the machines mirror each other’s actions. It is unclear which party takes the lead. Do the humans mimic the machines or are the machines following the humans? Each of the protagonists, whether human or mechanical, are vulnerable and naked –the humans stripped of clothing and the machines lacking protective covering. Like the celebrated film “Ballet Mechanique” by Leger, Martin’s film suggests the erotics of the mechanised world. The film evokes a history of modernist aspiration for utopia where man and machine would become bedfellows or at least entirely complimentary. The machines learn to think and act like humans echoing their appearance and actions. The work references both American body performance art of the 1960s and 1970s as well as Robert Morris’s work “Neoclassic” in which a naked dancer was filmed interacting with his sculptures at the Tate Gallery in 1971 in a series of peaceful, trancelike actions.","A number of Daria Martin’s films explore the relationship between humans and machines and make reference to modernist art, whether through the work of the Bauhuas (Schlemmer), Surrealism (Giacometti’s Palace at 4 AM) or American art of the 1960s and 1970s. Her films involve performance and many are shown as 16mm projections – assembling memories, reveries, scholarly research, and imported citations drawn from a wide range of sources including early twentieth century painting, sculpture, fashion, stage, and dance productions. “I came to the medium of film because of its open potential,” writes Daria Martin, “Its invitation to travel through time and space within an imagined world.” The artist values the contradictions of the medium of film, in particular the tension between the private fantasy it stimulates and the public physicality on which it depends.

Jeff Wall,"As suggested by its title, Pipe Opening (2002) depicts a hole in a wood wall exposed by the removal of a pipe. In contrast to his signature immense tableaux, Pipe Opening is a direct but modest document of a “real” scene that Wall “encountered by chance” in daily life. However factual, the image indicates certain enigmatic significance, allowing multiple interpretations. Wall encourages the viewer to engage with the scenario to imagine the before and the after of the moment. Compared to his earlier work, Wall’s photographs appear to be straight-up snapshots, exhibiting less manipulative details. The fictional details are not conveyed through obvious arrangements but due to the very nature of photographs: What they record is always an incomplete view of the world.","Internationally renowned photoconceptualist Jeff Wall is famous for his large-format lightboxes whose subject matter ranges from figurative portraiture to urban environment to mundane objects to elaborately constructed scenes.

Underneath elegant surface there is a deep sense of critical irony, elaborating by the contradictory nature of the cheap plastic items and their sophistic visual interpretation.

From often ignored daily life experiences as points of departure, Kan creates a visual diary. Here, the camera amplifies mundane activities to reveal absurd and eerie details. For example, in Kan Xuan, Ai!, she calls and answers her own name among the crowd in subway station; in Eggs, she squeezes and breaks eggs with her hands, and in A Sunny Day two middle-aged men laugh and tickle each other in a public plaza. In other works Kan engages feminist discourse by situating herself in uncomfortable situations or exposing her body, such as standing naked on a public pedestal in A Happy Girl or allowing spiders to crawl over her in Looking Looking Looking For!.",Island,Asia,"['ocular.a.02', 'object.n.01', 'material.s.01', 'render.v.01', 'plastic.n.01', 'market.n.01', 'island.n.01', 'global.s.01', 'economic.a.01', 'critical.a.01', 'production.n.01', 'poetic.a.01', 'aesthetic.a.01', 'interpretation.n.01', 'house.n.01', 'family.n.01', 'surface.n.01', 'structure.n.01', 'nature.n.01', 'sense.n.01', 'manner.n.01', 'elements.n.01', 'video.n.01', 'series.n.01']","['commodity.n.01', 'mass_production.n.01', 'domesticity.n.02', 'superficial.s.03', 'spectacle.n.02', 'aesthetics.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/xuan_kan_island_2006-2009.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/xuan_kan_island_2006-2009-100x300.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/island/,"['Cultural/24.16847350276144', 'Society/16.418329039381675', 'Individual_Personal/6.104511278195488']","['Cultural', 'Society', 'Individual_Personal']",46.69131382033861,"['Arts/10.58346129274922', 'Economy/8.418714618714619', 'Media/4.070604395604395']","['Arts', 'Economy', 'Media']",23.072780307068232,"['Cultural/33.607961646196955', 'Society/21.306501831501834', 'Individual_Personal/14.873044602456371']","['Cultural', 'Society', 'Individual_Personal']",69.78750808015516,"['Arts/13.05777849601379', 'Economy/7.312820512820513', 'Media/6.426373626373627']","['Arts', 'Economy', 'Media']",26.79697263520793,1.0,1.0
Pablo Pijnappel,"In Felicitas, we follow the converging routes of three characters: Felicitas, Michael and Andrew (the artist’s father-in-law who also features elsewhere). Felicitas is thedaughter of a German industrialist who immigrated to Rio after the Second World War. She is the one visible with a toucan in several images. In his work, Pablo Pijnappel privileges pre-existing images – the slides presented here are photographs found in his family archives or from other sources (media, photographs of film sets…). Sometimes, the same image is used several times with a different caption, thus encapsulating other meanings. Presented in the form of an installation with three synchronized slide projectors, Felicitas offers a complex scenario, where text and images can simultaneously be descriptive, intermingled or completely autonomous. Disjunctions and repetitions create the pace: the captioned images appear one after the other, with no regular order, sometimes on the left, in the centre or on the right. Even though the story follows a certain chronology, it is not linear and looks more like a complex collage of images and anecdotes which overlap. The text does not illustrate the images but functions as a complement that allows for the creation of multiple readings of the characters, of their lives, their trips and encounters. These collages are a mixture of real and fictional stories that enable Pijnappel to play with the notion of the documentary. The subtitles are in an informative tone, but they are mostly subjective and imagined commentaries thus creating what can be called a documentary fiction. This artwork has cinematographic qualities while deconstructing those conventions. Chris Marker’s film La jetée in which the relation between voice-over and still images creates a space for free interpretation was a likely direct influence.","Pablo Pijnappel’s work is foremost highly constructed. He builds narrations based on anecdotes and everyday events, perhaps souvenirs, family legends or plain fictions. The non-linear use of different archives and film extracts highlights this uncertainty and contributes to the loss of these stories over time. The works only offer pauses and silent moments, allowing the investment of our imagination. The ‘life stories’ told by Pablo Pijnappel are often those of his family who travelled a lot and had to adapt to new countries and their cultures. Through his tales, we visit Brazil in the 1940s, Japan, the United Kingdom and also Germany.  Pablo Pijnappel was born in 1979 in Paris, and he lives and works in Amsterdam.",Felicitas,Europe,"['complex.a.01', 'collage.n.01', 'image.n.01', 'fictional_character.n.01', 'narrative.n.01', 'world_war.n.01', 'trip.n.01', 'reading.n.01', 'documentary.a.01', 'creation.n.01', 'multiple.a.01', 'brush.n.06', 'play.v.01', 'documentary.n.01', 'scenario.n.01', 'times.n.01', 'repeat.n.01', 'direct.a.01', 'movie.n.01', 'fictional.a.01', 'function.n.01', 'fiction.n.01', 'relation.n.01', 'interpretation.n.01', 'quality.n.01']","['reinterpretation.n.02', 'disjunction.n.01', 'documentary.n.01', 'repetition.n.02', 'narrative.s.01', 'fabrication.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/img-255.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/img-255-300x200.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/felicitas/,"['Cultural/11.108137614019967', 'Society/2.3777777777777778', 'Politics/1.6']","['Cultural', 'Society', 'Politics']",15.085915391797744,"['Media/3.208963585434174', 'Fantasy/2.9230769230769234', 'Arts/1.7411764705882353']","['Media', 'Fantasy', 'Arts']",7.8732169790993325,"['Cultural/43.83461701696994', 'Individual_Personal/24.427534050057275', 'Society/16.7368544853839']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Society']",84.99900555241112,"['Arts/11.99364361129067', 'Fantasy/11.477064765300058', 'Media/9.353133304603894']","['Arts', 'Fantasy', 'Media']",32.82384168119462,0.6666666666666666,1.0
