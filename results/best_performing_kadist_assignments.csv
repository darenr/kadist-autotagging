Köken Ergun,"The Battle of Karbala was a military engagement that took place on 10 Muharram, 61 AH (October 10th, 680) in Karbala, situated in present day Iraq, when Hussein, the grandson of the prophet Muhammad, was killed. This battle is central to Shia Muslim belief in which Hussein’s martyrdom is commemorated each year, in a celebration called Ashura which symbolises the birth of Muslim division still at issue today between the Shia and Sunni. During Ashura, the artist worked in close collaboration with the people of Zeynebiye (referring to Hussein’s courageous sister, Zeyneb), documenting their preparations for the ceremonies, which involve a mass theatre performance and the isolated, weeping ritual at the end of the Ashura day. What in other countries is celebrated through a collective performance of blood and pain is experienced here through a highly theatrical and emotional day, presenting Islam as the practice of a culture rather than politics. Ergun attempts to question the cultural importance of religions against a “radical secularism” that has ruled Turkey until now.","Born in Istanbul, in 1976, Köken Ergun studied acting and worked with the American theatre director Robert Wilson. He then became interested in contemporary art, especially video and performance. Ergun’s preoccupations are based on forms of contemporary rituals and celebrations, religious or secular, through events such as national holidays, beauty contests or Olympic games. Ergun also collaborates with ethnologists, extending his practice to academia.",Ashura,Middle East & Africa,"['day.n.01', 'performance.n.01', 'theater.n.01', 'mass.n.01', 'collaboration.n.01', 'military.a.01', 'politics.n.01', 'corporate.s.03', 'issue.n.01', 'name.v.01', 'attempt.n.01', 'state.n.04', 'cardinal.s.01', 'practice.n.01', 'cultural.a.01', 'culture.n.01', 'people.n.01']","['islam.n.02', 'culture.n.06', 'ritual.n.02', 'commemoration.n.01', 'shiah.n.01', 'turkey.n.02']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/img_7713_dxo.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/img_7713_dxo-300x200.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/untitled-21/,"['Society/9.856699346405229', 'Individual_Personal/5.715217391304348', 'Cultural/4.423529411764706']","['Society', 'Individual_Personal', 'Cultural']",19.995446149474283,"['Spirituality/4.1152173913043475', 'Culture/3.623529411764706', 'Land/3.5712418300653597']","['Spirituality', 'Culture', 'Land']",11.309988633134413,"['Cultural/24.45894203835381', 'Society/24.06805449452509', 'Individual_Personal/19.18754578754579']","['Cultural', 'Society', 'Individual_Personal']",67.71454232042468,"['Culture/8.591849816849816', 'Spirituality/8.052747252747254', 'Arts/7.873319327731092']","['Culture', 'Spirituality', 'Arts']",24.51791639732816,1.0,0.6666666666666666
Lucia Madriz,"In her geometric paintings on wood panel, Madriz employs the Fibonacci numbers to illustrate, in simplified form, the pattern of natural plant growth—beginning from a single stem, and growing exponentially, rationally, and efficiently outward from there. Tinting the underlying wood but not covering it, Madriz’s delicate cubes seem to hover on the surface of the warm wood surfaces, drawing more attention to the grain and its own natural pattern. Always drawing the attention back to the natural world, Madriz’s multimedia works aim to reassert the natural, and our own links to it.","Born in Costa Rica and living in Germany, artist Lucía Madriz has a global perspective. Her videos, paintings, and installation works deal with issues of global concern—specifically agriculture, genetically modified crops, and the sustainability of our shared natural resources. Her interest in these issues has led her, in recent years, to develop installation projects where images are formed out of careful arrangements of seeds, grains, and dried beans—crops that sustain life in most of the globe’s cultures, and ones that are heavily implicated in the United State’s experiments with genetic modification.",Untitled,Americas,"['wood.n.01', 'natural.a.01', 'form.n.03', 'attention.n.01', 'surface.n.01', 'geometric.s.01', 'purpose.n.01', 'plant.n.01', 'individual.a.01', 'form.n.01']","['design.n.04', 'nature.n.03', 'agribusiness.n.01', 'sustainability.n.01', 'acculturation.n.02', 'botanic.a.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/img_lucia_madriz_untitled-child_of_threetree11_web.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/img_lucia_madriz_untitled-child_of_threetree11_web-300x200.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/untitled-lucia-madriz/,"['Individual_Personal/11.728205128205133', 'Cultural/8.842490842490841', 'Material_Physical/7.505685618729097']","['Individual_Personal', 'Cultural', 'Material_Physical']",28.07638158942507,"['Economy/5.931219073324336', 'Mind/4.774358974358975', 'Culture/3.6025641025641026']","['Economy', 'Mind', 'Culture']",14.308142150247413,"['Cultural/11.094871794871798', 'Society/5.51025641025641', 'Individual_Personal/4.8981684981684985']","['Cultural', 'Society', 'Individual_Personal']",21.50329670329671,"['Mind/4.128937728937729', 'Design/3.3076923076923075', 'Culture/3.107692307692308']","['Mind', 'Design', 'Culture']",10.544322344322346,0.6666666666666666,0.6666666666666666
Cheryl Donegan,"Fashion is the focus of Blood Sugar, which consists of a video projected onto a vintage vinyl jacket set at torso height on a dressmaker’s dummy. As suggested by the work’s title, Cheryl Donegan uses the body as a metaphor, relating the continuous cycle and recycle of images that characterizes consumer fashion culture to the flow of sugar in our blood. Formally, the work borrows strategies from conceptual art, and specifically video art from the 1960s and 1970s—such as the use of repetition, patterns, found materials, and a DIY, low-tech aesthetic—and combines it with contemporary cultural forms, in this case, the world of fashion.  In the video, as runway models emerge and recede into darkness, digitally inserted images of fabric patterns appear, hover across the screen and dissipate to the sound of a repetitive beat. As the video progresses, footage of a child wearing aluminum foil as clothes and another scene with a group of women wearing ornate dresses is overlaid with a collage of images of consumer objects and commercial spaces. The result is a an meditation on fashion’s most essential elements: fabric, the body and the mediated image.","Cheryl Donegan is best known for her performance and video works that deal primarily with ideas of sex, gender, and the ways in which the female body is represented both in art and more broadly across popular culture. During the 1990s, Donegan’s practice was influenced by of a range of movements that brought into question aspects of feminism, identity politics and politically engaged art—the underground feminist hardcore punk movement Riot Girl, and the grunge, slacker, and DIY cultures among them.  Donegan often uses her body as an apparatus for mark making, incorporating performative actions that are captured by the camera and that result in or relate to process paintings and drawings. Combining these bodily gestures with found consumer objects and imagery, her works interrogate the conventions of different forms of popular culture such as music videos and advertising, while at the same time considering the politics of self-representation.  Most recently, she has continued her exploration of the mediated image, mark marking and its relationship to the body through a series of paintings and sculptures, as well as videos distributed on social media.",Blood Sugar,Americas,"['manner.n.01', 'form.n.03', 'video.n.01', 'body.n.01', 'image.n.01', 'dark.n.01', 'scheme.n.01', 'conceptual.s.01', 'repeat.n.01', 'put.v.01', 'footage.n.01', 'fabric.n.01', 'model.n.01', 'metaphor.n.01', 'screen.n.01', 'collage.n.01', 'child.n.01', 'sound.n.01', 'elements.n.01', 'consequence.n.01', 'woman.n.01', 'contemporary.s.01', 'cultural.a.01', 'culture.n.01', 'title.n.01']","['fashion.n.03', 'consumerism.n.01', 'body.n.01', 'design.n.04', 'picture.n.01', 'aesthetic.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_BLOOD_SUGAR_ED1_alternative_dressform-WEB.png,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_BLOOD_SUGAR_ED1_alternative_dressform-WEB-200x300.png,https://kadist.org/work/blood-sugar/,"['Cultural/10.469902792426012', 'Material_Physical/9.472027972027973', 'Individual_Personal/4.379084967320262']","['Cultural', 'Material_Physical', 'Individual_Personal']",24.321015731774246,"['Space/6.346153846153846', 'Design/5.361344537815126', 'Economy/2.6783216783216783']","['Space', 'Design', 'Economy']",14.38582006229065,"['Cultural/19.90928858722977', 'Material_Physical/16.602863802863805', 'Individual_Personal/11.718381927669855']","['Cultural', 'Material_Physical', 'Individual_Personal']",48.23053431776343,"['Mind/7.395604395604397', 'Space/6.346153846153846', 'Design/5.6867772750125685']","['Mind', 'Space', 'Design']",19.42853551677081,1.0,0.6666666666666666
Yang Xinguang,"Although seemingly unadorned at first glance, Yang Xinguang’s sculptural work Phenomena (2009) employs minimalist aesthetics as a means of gesturing towards the various commonalities and conflicts between civilization and the natural world. Comprised of rudimentary planks of wood hammered together into a rectangular form, Yang’s work uses reclaimed materials from everyday life and seems deliberately in conversation with Arte Povera, the art movement that originated in Italy during the late 1960s where practitioners produced art from found and common materials as an act of resistance against the decided commercialization of the art world through market economies. Yang, by extension, pays close attention to his materials in attempt to release the forms within them rather than impose his own. He rarely adds anything to the materials that he uses; instead, he chisels, pares and scrapes the excess away, allowing his completed works to emerge through a combination of happenstance and almost meditative handwork. In Phenomena, Yang’s handwork becomes apparent in a constellation-like form scratched into the wood. Suddenly, the nails and knots in the wood’s surface become vertices in a larger web of connecting lines, suggesting the inexorable interconnections between our alternately fabricated and naturally occurring environments. Rather than privileging one over the other, Yang’s work invites us to contemplate these relationships and how these coessential phenomena define our existence.","Yang Xinguang is an artist whose work explores the interconnections between the natural world fabricated materials in a post-industrialist society. His work is deliberately restrained and frequently uses reclaimed materials such as found wood planks, a gesture that recalls the Arte Povera movement’s commitment to using un-rarified and common materials in art making practice. His work is also deeply invested in exploring the phenomenological relationship between viewers and artworks, and his sculptural installations gesture towards Minimalist traditions, inviting viewers to pause and consider their own relationship to their surrounding space. Yang is a graduate of the Central Academy of Fine Arts in China. He has exhibited extensively throughout China and has had international exhibitions at venues such as Artissima, Turin, and Art 41 Basel in Switzerland.",Phenomena,Asia,"['wood.n.01', 'phenomenon.n.01', 'material.n.01', 'form.n.01', 'everyday.s.01 life.n.01', 'brooding.s.01', 'market.n.01', 'glance.n.01', 'being.n.01', 'aesthetics.n.01', 'combination.n.01', 'late.a.01', 'conversation.n.01', 'economy.n.01', 'common.a.01', 'resistance.n.01', 'sculptural.a.01', 'line.n.01', 'attention.n.01', 'natural.a.01', 'environment.n.01', 'attempt.n.01', 'everyday.s.01', 'surface.n.01', 'relationship.n.01']","['object.n.01', 'surface.n.01', 'everyday.s.03', 'modernism.n.01', 'commonplace.s.01', 'criticism.n.02']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/xinguang_yang_phenomena_web.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/xinguang_yang_phenomena_web-300x200.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/phenomena/,"['Cultural/12.249811463046761', 'Society/3.91025641025641', 'Material_Physical/3.888888888888889']","['Cultural', 'Society', 'Material_Physical']",20.04895676219206,"['Arts/6.40365761689291', 'Economy/2.371794871794872', 'Design/2.307692307692308']","['Arts', 'Economy', 'Design']",11.08314479638009,"['Cultural/34.32537754643018', 'Society/22.92159244264508', 'Individual_Personal/19.357857931542142']","['Cultural', 'Society', 'Individual_Personal']",76.6048279206174,"['Arts/10.502789023841656', 'Economy/8.431501831501834', 'Time/7.828571428571428']","['Arts', 'Economy', 'Time']",26.76286228391492,0.6666666666666666,0.6666666666666666
Raphaël Zarka,"This photograph seems to be awaiting meaning, it more or less evokes known elements without really identifying with them completely: a motorway interchange, a bridge, an electric pylon… In fact this is the end of the tracks of the Aérotrain, a wheelless monorail invented by Jean Bertin in the 1970s, which acts like ‘a fossil of movement on landscape scale’, as explained by the artist. This fragmentary place is meant to activate physical movement. It also activates the spectator’s imagination.  The series Les formes du repos is a photographic collection of concrete geometric objects, in undefinable spaces, set aside or in waiting. The photographic document allows the display of these ‘involuntary sculptures’. Paired down geometric forms (whether modernist or futurist) appear tensely in their decor (a field, several buildings on the horizon). This photograph is key in the series, since the tracks are no longer an object but a space. The positioning of the shot emphasises the fragmentary character, the tracks only lead to an empty decor. Observing this defunct functionality, the artist, with Vincent Lamouroux, created Pentacycle (a mono terrain vehicle, 2002) in order to reactivate movement on this ruin.","Raphaël Zarka presents himself as a sculptor and artist-collector. He scrutinises the contemporary world to draw up a genealogy of geometric forms. He is constantly noticing Plato’s polyhedrons (speculative geometric forms) materialized in concrete breakwaters (Les formes du repos series/The Forms of Rest). His work highlights the fact that the ‘survival of forms’ (Aby Warburg) takes place in today’s world in functional and concrete environments. The artist acts with the curiosity of the Renaissance humanists in their studio (Studiolo, 2008), but he has adopted a thinking structure where dichotomies and the methodological boundaries of Art History are banned. With his typical transversal approach, the artist has started theoretical research into the urban practice that is skateboard by publishing essays and realizing artistic projects. In Riding modern art  (Lyon Biennale, 2007), he confronts photographs of the skaters performing on public sculptures with a sculpture by Katarzyna Kobro. The confrontation underlines that the movement is either of aesthetic potential for modern sculpture or a mechanical realization for skating. “It’s almost an insult to the mysteries of the world to think that we could invent anything or that we needed to invent anything”; this quote by Borgès has become the artist’s motto.Raphaël Zarka was born in 1957 in Montpellier, France.

Wadada Leo Smith,"Kosmic Music is a musical score comprised of two parts: a single mixed media drawing titled Colors and Satellites, and a pair of mixed media drawings titled Koral Reef. Conceived of together as a single musical score, the three drawings exemplify a specific stage in the evolution of Wadada Leo Smith’s Ankhrasmation Language, which he has been developing since 1967.  Although at first glance the works in Kosmic Music might appear abstract compositions drawn on paper, as with other scores produced by Smith, suggestions of musical structures are revealed upon closer inspection: an entanglement of musical sheets and bright geometric forms.  The artist activates these works by performing the scores live, sometimes accompanied by other musicians who are familiar with his Ankhrasmation Language and can follow the cues from the formal and musical components of the works. As described by Smith: “the scores are constructed in a way that can be used to produce music, but the music itself is not on the score. The score is this doorway where you become aware of elements like structure, shapes, color and [the] connection of those shapes and colors and lines and dots. You have to transform that into some kind of reference, [and] then you’re able to actually get to the music.”","Wadada Leo Smith is an avant-garde jazz musician, composer, educator and visual artist, celebrated for his creative and unconventional approach to music.  Over the past 50 years, a focal point of his practice has involved the ongoing research and development of his own musical language, which he calls Ankhrasmation: a neologism formed from the terms ‘Ankh,’ the Egyptian symbol for life, ‘Ras,’ the Ethiopian word for leader, and ‘Ma,’ a universal term for mother. This language is characterized by musical scores that avoid (and at times, incorporate) traditional notationsin favor of symbolic compositions of color, line, and shape. Improvisational elements of jazz are woven into Smith’s colorful pieces, some of the scores taking up to several days to perform. These vibrant constructions are filled with energy and mystery, providing creative guidance for the seasoned improviser while allowing musicians to bring their own expertise and strengths to their performance.",Kosmic Music,Americas,"['mark.n.01', 'music.n.01', 'colors.n.01', 'produce.v.01', 'individual.a.01', 'language.n.01', 'structure.n.01', 'shape.n.01', 'medium.n.01', 'drawing.n.01', 'transform.v.01', 'glance.n.01', 'sheet.n.01', 'pull.v.01', 'pair.n.01', 'component.n.01', 'uncover.v.01', 'familiar.a.01', 'phase.n.01', 'specific.a.01', 'connection.n.01', 'formal.a.01', 'line.n.01', 'abstract.a.01', 'color.n.01']","['music.n.01', 'language.n.01', 'drawing.n.01', 'geometric.s.01', 'performance.n.01', 'structure.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_21432-01-WEB.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_21432-01-WEB-233x300.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/kosmic-music/,"['Cultural/15.247496947496952', 'Society/5.051282051282051', 'Individual_Personal/0.8571428571428571']","['Cultural', 'Society', 'Individual_Personal']",21.15592185592186,"['Arts/8.743223443223442', 'Economy/2.371794871794872', 'Design/2.307692307692308']","['Arts', 'Economy', 'Design']",13.422710622710623,"['Cultural/27.899570853982627', 'Society/8.31196581196581', 'Individual_Personal/8.04807153630683']","['Cultural', 'Society', 'Individual_Personal']",44.259608202255265,"['Arts/9.445787545787546', 'Media/7.531108597285066', 'Design/4.931221719457014']","['Arts', 'Media', 'Design']",21.908117862529625,1.0,0.6666666666666666
Kwan Sheung Chi,"Kwan Sheung Chi’s work One Million is a video work depicting the counting of bills. Divided into three versions, the video first shows a number of Japanese ten-thousand-yen bills being counted without in an orderly, efficient manner. In Two Million, a similar counting of one-thousand-dollar bills from Hong Kong follows. However, a closer viewing of the videos reveal that they were created by looping the same scene of moving fingers, giving the illusion that many bills are being counted when, in fact, only a few are in the scene. Beyond commenting on the illusions of transactions and interdependencies in a regional economy, the video calls attention to the way media distort quantity as well as manipulations of values occurring with the transcoding of economic units into visual data. The false appearance of accountability presented in One Million and Two Million highlight the instability underlying the desire for convenience and efficiency in a globalized, media-dependent economy.","Kwan Sheung Chi obtained a third honor B.A. degree in Fine Art from The Chinese University of Hong Kong. In 2003, Kwan manufactured an exhibition history and CV for himself, hosting a retrospective as first solo show towards the end of art school in order to critique the unspoken conventions of the contemporary art system. In general, Kwan’s works explore the nexus between art and text and use repetition as a constant measure of time and a metaphor for life as he states: “Repetition gives the work power.” He is especially interested in how meaning is constructed, who makes art, and the interaction of other people, places and things as part of the work’s cultural context.",ONE MILLION (Japanese Yen),Asia,"['illusion.n.01', 'economy.n.01', 'scene.n.01', 'video.n.01', 'version.n.01', 'appearance.n.01', 'japanese.a.01', 'desire.n.01', 'attention.n.01', 'economic.a.01', 'medium.n.01', 'manner.n.01', 'ocular.a.02', 'make.v.03']","['money.n.01', 'medium.n.10', 'economy.n.01', 'delusion.n.03', 'data.n.01', 'political.a.02']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/02_web-1.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/02_web-1-300x169.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/one-million-japanese-yen/,"['Cultural/5.514285714285714', 'Society/3.6025641025641026', 'Material_Physical/2.3692307692307697']","['Cultural', 'Society', 'Material_Physical']",11.486080586080586,"['Economy/3.6025641025641026', 'Media/2.0', 'Technology/1.8571428571428572']","['Economy', 'Media', 'Technology']",7.45970695970696,"['Individual_Personal/18.127650127650135', 'Cultural/14.542830209006683', 'Material_Physical/11.324542124542127']","['Individual_Personal', 'Cultural', 'Material_Physical']",43.99502246119894,"['Emotion/12.381618381618384', 'Media/6.849789915966386', 'Economy/3.371794871794872']","['Emotion', 'Media', 'Economy']",22.603203169379643,0.6666666666666666,0.6666666666666666
Hiraki Sawa,"Hako (2006) depicts a mysterious and dystopic landscape where the world becomes flat: distance between different spaces, depth of field and three-dimensional perceptions are canceled. Interiors of a Victorian doll’s house, a rippled seascape, a palm tree forest, and a gravel seashore are superimposed, morphing into each other. The hermetic narrative is charged with psychological and mythological aspects. Hako reflects Sawa’s interests in psychotherapies, in particular, the sand tray therapy, also known as sandplay, created by Dora Kalff. Sandplay asks participants to create their own arrangement of objects in a sandbox by choosing from a wide range of small figures to which the subconscious attaches symbolic meanings. Echoing this process, Sawa creates his imaginary dimensions where rules and selected elements allow for improvisation and play to reveal unconscious processes. Certain elements give visual clues and metaphorically comment on issues such as the hybridity of the human and the non-human. This is indicated by walking trees and a miniature toy clock that is animated to keep real world time in order to ponder the illusionary concept of linear time. Reality is not scientific. As the fantastical becomes everyday and the supernatural becomes commonplace, so does the reverse.","London-based Japanese artist Hiraki Sawa’s video installations and filmic works probe landscapes, psychological dreamlands, domestic interiors, imaginary spaces, ideas of displacement and migration, and above all, the inner self. He weaves animals, people, plants, animated and inanimate objects into a series of surreal sequences to create enigmatic and immersive worlds of sound and image. Employing a combination of digital editing and hand-made methods of cutting, pasting and collaging, Sawa highlights the ambiguous boundaries between facts and fictions and meditates on how remembrance and memory can be manipulated by time, emotion and mental influences.",Hako,Asia,"['tree.n.01', 'elements.n.01', 'procedure.n.01', 'make.v.03', 'rule.n.01', 'psychological.s.01', 'field.n.01', 'agreement.n.04', 'distance.n.01', 'uncover.v.01', 'percept.n.01', 'dimension.n.01', 'time.n.01', 'aspect.n.01', 'symbolic.a.01', 'concept.n.01', 'play.n.01', 'house.n.01', 'issue.n.01', 'inspire.v.01', 'real.a.01', 'everyday.s.01', 'meaning.n.01', 'world.n.03', 'ocular.a.02']","['percept.n.01', 'psychotherapy.n.01', 'symbolism.n.01', 'unconscious_mind.n.01', 'supernatural.n.01', 'fiction.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/hiraki_sawa_hako_2006_web.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/hiraki_sawa_hako_2006_web-300x225.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/hako/,"['Cultural/12.830128205128206', 'Individual_Personal/8.491350316350315', 'Material_Physical/1.7142857142857142']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Material_Physical']",23.035764235764237,"['Fantasy/7.291666666666667', 'Mind/5.847119547119546', 'Culture/3.076923076923077']","['Fantasy', 'Mind', 'Culture']",16.21570929070929,"['Individual_Personal/32.94148172089349', 'Cultural/29.591686418157014', 'Material_Physical/9.843986568986569']","['Individual_Personal', 'Cultural', 'Material_Physical']",72.37715470803707,"['Mind/13.143864468864471', 'Culture/12.61868131868132', 'Values/9.008089133089134']","['Mind', 'Culture', 'Values']",34.770634920634926,1.0,0.6666666666666666
Taiki Sakpisit,"A Ripe Volcano, a collaboration with Yasuhiro Morinaga, revisits two sites of violence and aggression in Thailand’s recent past: The Rattanakosin Hotel, the site where the military troops captured and tortured the civilians, students and protestors who were hiding inside the hotel during the Black May of 1992; and Ratchadamnoen Stadium, a Roman amphitheater-style Muay Thai boxing arena, which was built in 1941-45 during the Second World War and since then has become the theatrical labyrinth for more acculturated and commercially “acceptable” displays of bloodshed. The work builds around the recollections of human experiences that took place within these spaces and shifts through the mental space distilled from the possessed memory of wounded time. Within the medium of the multi-channel video/ sound installation, Sakpisit and Morinaga create dreamlike variations sprawling through darkened room where the haunting images and ambient sounds float through the space, creating an exquisitely hypnotizing experience. A Ripe Volcano is an allegorical revelation where Bangkok becomes a site of mental eruption and the emotionally devastated land during the heights of terrors, primal fears, trauma, and the darkness of time. Through a rich use of saturated color and diffuse light, the film evocatively recalls the histories of the various figures – soldiers, protestors, boxers, and spectators – whose traumatic experiences still haunt the empty rooms they once occupied. The remains of these intense experiences and traces of memories are rendered here through a kind of imaginative cinematic re-embodiment, the physical and psychological pain and suffering transformed into the dreamlike landscape of images. A Ripe Volcano, by extension, both pays tribute to these embodied histories while also creating a new space for healing through artistic expression and creative connection with audiences.","Taiki Sakpisit is a filmmaker and media-based artist whose work explores depictions of violence and unease that emerged from the political upheaval in Thailand from the late 1980s to the present day. A deftly skilled editor, his work frequently incorporates sophisticated use of montage and soundscape to produce experiences that are both sensually resonate and narratively disjointed as part of a larger strategy to disorient audiences and engage them in heightened modes of viewership. Sakpisit has screened his films extensively in venues throughout Southeast Asian and has been included in festivals at the Tokyo Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Gio Verona Video Festival, and the Birbeck Institute for the Moving Image, London.",A Ripe Volcano,Asia,"['experience.n.01', 'sound.n.01', 'space.n.01', 'memory.n.01', 'soldier.n.01', 'transform.v.01', 'psychological.s.01', 'dark.n.01', 'injury.n.01', 'fear.n.01', 'history.n.01', 'creative.a.01', 'shift.n.01', 'display.n.01', 'collaboration.n.01', 'military.a.01', 'black.n.01', 'trace.n.01', 'connection.n.01', 'time.n.01', 'land.n.01', 'expression.n.01', 'audience.n.01', 'physical.a.01', 'violence.n.01']","['violence.n.01', 'aggression.n.01', 'military.n.01', 'history.n.01', 'bloodshed.n.01', 'wound.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/a_ripe_volcano_06_web.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/a_ripe_volcano_06_web-300x84.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/a-ripe-volcano/,"['Society/10.387563843703298', 'Material_Physical/3.3090909090909095', 'Politics/2.541176470588235']","['Society', 'Material_Physical', 'Politics']",16.237831223382443,"['Violence/6.77162181471779', 'Time/2.509090909090909', 'War/1.7826086956521738']","['Violence', 'Time', 'War']",11.063321419460872,"['Individual_Personal/18.719394640447277', 'Material_Physical/12.900630088865386', 'Society/11.606011635423402']","['Individual_Personal', 'Material_Physical', 'Society']",43.22603636473606,"['Emotion/10.543223443223445', 'Violence/5.567550096961861', 'Time/5.101851090086384']","['Emotion', 'Violence', 'Time']",21.21262463027169,0.6666666666666666,0.6666666666666666

Angela Detanico & Rafael Lain,"Letters of the Greek alphabet glisten on a black background. When a letter appears, there is a sound. Each letter corresponds to a star in the sky. Alphas, betas, gammas spread in space. The sound attributed to the first letters is high-pitched, then it gets lower for the rest of the letters in alphabetical order. The composition is organised according to the order of magnitude which attributes a letter to every star in the constellation. A cartographic order is established : sequences of alphas, gammas, betas come to pass simultaneously. The positioning of the letters corresponds to that of the stars in the Northern Sky map, their appearance is guided by the distance compared to the previous star. The distance on the map is used as a given time : the closer a star is to the next one in space, the closer it is in space.","Linguists, semiologists and graphic designers by training, Angela Detanico and Raphaël Lain consider the use of graphic signs in society. They are interested in the notion and notation of time and create new typographies by substituting letters from traditional alphabets with forms taken from the everyday. These forms are then displayed in the exhibition spaces which allows for a new materiality to be read. Detanico & Lain consider the role of language. Language reveals its double function, as a communication tool as well as an instrument for reading and a reflection on different cultures.  Oscillating between rudimentary techniques and cutting edge technology, their works take such diverse forms as letters, words, still images, animation, sound and installation. Whether alphabets, cartographies or calendars, they address the actual foundations of these codes that govern our daily lives, certain of the operative links between signs and meaning.

Roman Ondak,"This work needs to be considered in relation to one of his performances during which people were made to queue in front of the Kunsthalle of Frankfurt in 2003 (Tate Collection). In this instance Ondak collected images of people queuing in front of all sorts of buildings in various newspapers. He then inserted these in a Slovakian newspaper without trying to give any coherence with the information in the text on the same page. The result is a fictional space with the potential for the invention of different scenarios. The theme of people queuing encourages the consideration of the relation between interior and exterior but also of exclusion. It can also be a reference to deprivation during periods of war or economic depression. In the manner of works by Felix Gonzales-Torres, the audience can take a copy of the newspaper which therefore leaves the exhibition space. The fact that the message or the artwork circulates is an integral part of the artistic gesture. People lining up behind one another also formally becomes a living sculpture. The refusal to allow the object to be recouped by the flux of liberal economy echoes the refusal of any monumentality which was used so often by authoritarian regimes.","In 2009, Roman Ondák won the Golden Lion at the Venice Biennale for Loop, the Pavilion of the Czech and Slovak Republics, for which he brought the same plant-life and trees growing outside inside. This highly considered installation epitomizes Ondák’s work. With often discreet, tongue-in-cheek, conceptual, participatory modes, he succeeds in profoundly questioning the art world and its established quirks, exhibition spaces, behaviors like queuing, labeling or various pedagogical approaches, visitor experience, any misplaced preciousness about authenticity or authorship. Various tactics (asking friends for drawings) or forms (shoelaces for instance) recur in his photographs, performances, installations, videos. Borderlines are deliberately blurred between the exhibition space and reality. This is infused by his relation to each specific project context and by his own ongoing experience of changing Eastern Europe.  Roman Ondak was born in 1966 in Zilina, Slovakia.

Catherine Opie,"Although best known as a provocateur and portraitist, Opie also photographs landscapes, cityscapes, and architecture. The Freeway Series was developed in 1995, right after the artist’s inclusion in that year’s Whitney Biennial. As if suggesting that her work should not be restricted to being seen through overtly political or activist lenses, this series lends insight into the city of Los Angeles via its most characteristic urban feature: its highways. By documenting the monumental concrete structures devoid of humans or vehicles, one is suddenly conscious of their real scale, an element only emphasized by the small format of the printed photographs. The otherwise unnoticed massive structures are thus made strange. Like Allen Ruppersberg’s Untitled (City Limits), which also are taken along the freeway, Opie’s photographs have particular resonance within the Kadist’s “101 Collection.”","Since the 1990s, Catherine Opie has been recognized for her use of documentary photography to address issues of community and queerness, and the ways in which identity is shaped by architecture. Particularly resonant during the Culture Wars of the 1980s and early 1990s—a time in which the religious right tried to impose itself as a political force and cultural censor—Opie’s photographs privilege the representation of specific communities, whether the LGBT, teenagers, surfers, football players, or her group of friends who engage in sexual role playing, tattooing, and piercing.",Freeway Series,Americas,"['structure.n.01', 'city.n.01', 'world.n.08', 'lens.n.01', 'los_angeles.n.01', 'component.n.01', 'feature.n.01', 'photograph.n.01', 'format.n.01', 'architecture.n.01', 'scale.n.01', 'urban.a.01', 'series.n.01', 'real.a.01', 'political.a.01', 'landscape.n.01']","['cityscape.n.01', 'architecture.n.01', 'photography.n.01', 'urban.a.01', 'document.v.01', 'landscape.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/cathy_opie_untitled_26_from_freeway_series_1994_0.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/cathy_opie_untitled_26_from_freeway_series_1994_0-300x98.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/untitled-16-and-untitled-17-freeway-series/,"['Cultural/4.6458978328173375', 'Society/4.488888888888889', 'Material_Physical/1.8']","['Cultural', 'Society', 'Material_Physical']",10.934786721706228,"['Arts/4.6458978328173375', 'Urbanization/2.688888888888889', 'History/1.8']","['Arts', 'Urbanization', 'History']",9.134786721706227,"['Cultural/19.666548157724637', 'Society/16.31912095472467', 'Material_Physical/8.413725490196079']","['Cultural', 'Society', 'Material_Physical']",44.39939460264539,"['Urbanization/9.90800984361356', 'Arts/9.259609997845294', 'Land/5.780392156862745']","['Urbanization', 'Arts', 'Land']",24.948011998321597,1.0,0.6666666666666666
Moké,"Moké’s Sans Titre (1994) depicts the everyday life of the suburbs from a distant and elevated perspective. Looking down on a residential area we see groups of children playing in the street, we see cars and trucks loaded with produce backed up on the road that runs through the center of the tableau. We see two Skol adverting billboards that line the road; Skol being the fifth biggest beer brand by volume in the world that was established in the Democratic Republic of Congo in 1965. An outward flying plane glides closely over the scene. Sans Titre (1994) is, above all, a scene of the various structures and functions of society seemingly peacefully co-existing.","Moké (the acronym of Monsengwo Kejwamfi) was a pivotal figure in establishing the style of ‘Popular Painting’ in Kinshasa following Congo’s independence in 1960. Moké had no formal training and his early works were often executed on found materials, such as discarded cardboard. Soon, his lively and dynamic paintings of Kinshasa garnered the attention of the public and in 1965 he painted a portrait of General Mobutu (president of the DRC, 1965–1997).

Kiran Subbaiah,"Flight Rehearsals focuses on Subbaiah’s desire to fly as a means to highlight the relationship between human ambition and limitations of the physical world. The video presents philosophical explorations of the human desire to defy gravity and time. The minimalist set of a table highlights the intention and persistence of the protagonist rather than technological innovation. The video manipulates the camera angle to distort the appearance of space so that Subbaiah’s repeated attempts at beating gravity can achieve momentary flights. As the flight attempts move into the bedroom, what first appears to be a close up of an alarm clock turns out to be an oversized ringing alarm clock further back to create a distortion of space through manipulations in scale. Such effects highlight both the proximity and distance between apparent success and distorted perception.","Born in Sidpur and living in Bangalore, Kiran Subbaiah works in a variety of media that includes assemblage, video and internet art after initial training as a sculptor. His works examine the relationships of use and value in everyday objects through subverting form and function. Constructing paradoxes through deadpan and humor, Subbaiah’s works also manipulate the object in an act of emancipation in order to highlight art’s autonomy from having to serve a purpose.

Wang Tuo,"The Interrogation is a video constructed entirely from still film photography and photoshop collage — playing out as a photomontage along with a voiceover. By using still photography instead the moving images, Wang Tuo creates room for the audience’s imagination. The voiceover produces a rhythm to enhance the tensions in the work. The work contains two intertwined narratives–one comes from an audio recording of the artist interviewing a local officer from the Commission for Discipline Inspection. In this interview, the officer talks about the psychological tricks he had used to succeed at his job interview. Then he describes the mental methods he always applies to his suspects during the interrogation process. The other narrative is a short story written by the artist and inspired by Ingmar Bergman’s movie Persona (1966). In the story, an actress who refuses to speak and the nurse trying to make her talk gradually switch roles and turn into each other. These two narratives together bring to mind the complexity of the reality that we are currently in. At the end, the role between the interrogator and interrogated , the actress and the nurse are exchanged. Questions such as the trust crisis, the anxiety and loneliness of modern men and women, the lack of security, the desire of being understood are uncovered.","Wang Tuo employs various mediums and a process that combines interviews, reality shows and the theatre of the absurd to construct a maze of melodrama. Through his performative manipulation on individual´s lived experiences and intervention in intellectual legacies such as literature, film, theatre and art history, Wang’s practice attempts to examine the unreliable relationship between the contemporary human status, myth and cultural archive.",The Interrogation,Asia,"['interview.n.01', 'narrative.n.01', 'function.n.03', 'method.n.01', 'rhythm.n.01', 'psychological.s.01', 'occupation.n.01', 'complexity.n.01', 'imagination.n.01', 'movie.n.01', 'uncover.v.01', 'short.a.01', 'local.a.01', 'audience.n.01', 'desire.n.01', 'write.v.01', 'tension.n.01', 'modern.a.01', 'collage.n.01', 'inspire.v.01', 'narrative.s.01', 'photography.n.01', 'construct.v.01', 'woman.n.01', 'world.n.03']","['question.n.03', 'question.n.01', 'movie.n.01', 'persona.n.02']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/WANGTuo_TheInterrogation_filmStill1.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/WANGTuo_TheInterrogation_filmStill1-300x169.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/the-interrogation/,['Cultural/5.984920634920635'],['Cultural'],5.984920634920635,"['Media/3.327777777777778', 'Arts/2.657142857142857']","['Media', 'Arts']",5.984920634920635,"['Cultural/29.793109118263928', 'Individual_Personal/26.625280421333063', 'Society/12.081404869640167']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Society']",68.49979440923715,"['Emotion/13.181618381618385', 'Arts/8.036374023293527', 'Media/6.629151404151404']","['Emotion', 'Arts', 'Media']",27.847143809063315,0.5,0.8
Toyin Ojih Odutola,"As she traces the same shape again and again, Ojih Odutola’s lines become darker and deeper, sometimes pushed to the point where their blackness becomes luminous.

Known for her intricate drawings of human heads and figures, Ojih Odutola’s artistic practice is concerned with the representation of race, and the concept of blackness as visual marker and social construct. Her drawings are made through intricately and fastidiously layering black lines—building up a density that Ojih Odutola describes as “black on black on black.” Using pens and markers as her primary media, Ojih Odutola builds textures through sinewy black lines, shot through at times with metallic color.

Goldin+Senneby,"In Fiction on Auction, the site of the auction is used to stage a fiction where the right to appear as character in Looking for Headless is offered to the highest bidder: the name of the successful biddder as registered for the auction will form the name or identity of the character appearing in the novel.  Looking for Headless is written by the fictitious author K.D and tells the story of two artists Simon Goldin and Jakob Senneby who collaborate with an author, John Barlow. Goldin and Senneby investigate an offshore company on the Bahamas called Headless Ltd whilst Barlow writes a docu-fictional murder-mystery, also called Headless, based on these investigations. The three protagonists become increasingly entangled in the world of offshore business, while speculating about the possible connections between Headless Ltd and the secret society known as Acéphale ( from the Greek term, acephalus, meaning headless) founded by George Bataille and his circle of friends connected to the College de Sociologie in Paris in the late 1930s.  Goldin and Senneby have created a series of exhibition projects in parallel with Looking for Headless which examine elements of the novel, including the identity of Headless Ltd, and explore the juridical construction of off-shore financial centres as strategies of withdrawal from public visibility.

Pablo Pijnappel,"In Felicitas, we follow the converging routes of three characters: Felicitas, Michael and Andrew (the artist’s father-in-law who also features elsewhere). Felicitas is thedaughter of a German industrialist who immigrated to Rio after the Second World War. She is the one visible with a toucan in several images. In his work, Pablo Pijnappel privileges pre-existing images – the slides presented here are photographs found in his family archives or from other sources (media, photographs of film sets…). Sometimes, the same image is used several times with a different caption, thus encapsulating other meanings. Presented in the form of an installation with three synchronized slide projectors, Felicitas offers a complex scenario, where text and images can simultaneously be descriptive, intermingled or completely autonomous. Disjunctions and repetitions create the pace: the captioned images appear one after the other, with no regular order, sometimes on the left, in the centre or on the right. Even though the story follows a certain chronology, it is not linear and looks more like a complex collage of images and anecdotes which overlap. The text does not illustrate the images but functions as a complement that allows for the creation of multiple readings of the characters, of their lives, their trips and encounters. These collages are a mixture of real and fictional stories that enable Pijnappel to play with the notion of the documentary. The subtitles are in an informative tone, but they are mostly subjective and imagined commentaries thus creating what can be called a documentary fiction. This artwork has cinematographic qualities while deconstructing those conventions. Chris Marker’s film La jetée in which the relation between voice-over and still images creates a space for free interpretation was a likely direct influence.","Pablo Pijnappel’s work is foremost highly constructed. He builds narrations based on anecdotes and everyday events, perhaps souvenirs, family legends or plain fictions. The non-linear use of different archives and film extracts highlights this uncertainty and contributes to the loss of these stories over time. The works only offer pauses and silent moments, allowing the investment of our imagination. The ‘life stories’ told by Pablo Pijnappel are often those of his family who travelled a lot and had to adapt to new countries and their cultures. Through his tales, we visit Brazil in the 1940s, Japan, the United Kingdom and also Germany.

Joe Scanlan,"Spring Line is a piece shown for the first time in his solo exhibition at the Institut d’Art Contemporain in Villeurbanne in 2007. It pays homage to the work of the famous conceptual artist Sol LeWitt, who had died on 8 April that year. Scanlan aims to guide the spectator to gage the level of influence Sol LeWitt has had on his work with regards the conversion of potential ideas into sculpture. Forsythia stems, a theme in his work of the last 7 years, are seen as concrete drawings where each stem is a line in space and each flower a mark. Taking the concept of Sol LeWitt’s instructions in which the artwork exists first as an idea before realization, Spring Line applies the same principle by which an artwork exists first of all as a mobile box prior to installation. The way in which the drawings are exhibited in space can vary: in Villeurbanne they were dispersed, during the Armory Show the stems all stayed in the box, in Amsterdam only 5 drawings were created, the other stems stayed in the box. Thus Spring Line is a variable image which is adaptable to any space and reinvented each time. The forsythia motif resonates with this idea, since it is a flower that renews itself constantly in the cycle of seasons – eternal and forever new.","Joe Scanlan became known in the 1990s due to his very particular appropriation of Conceptual art, exploiting two main registers: display on one hand, designating the artwork as a consumable product, DIY on the other, advocating the mobility and adaptability of objects, even their reversibility depending on contexts and usages. Scanlan’s work turns out to be reversible. A shelf can appear to be a minimal construction and be used as a shelf, as implied by functional logic. The technical simplicity of Scanlan’s realizations purposely leaning towards low-tech, with subsidiary possibilities for most of them to be de-installed and stored with no difficulty, convey something practical (art can be concretely useful) and aesthetic (each one of the artist’s creations carries a specific function but also has its own plastic qualities) in the work. Thus Joe Scanlan’s practice involves strategies that question the market and the value of a work of art. Extremely surprised by the attitude of students who are already wooed by galleries while they are still training, he invents Donnelle Woolford, a fictional artist he launches in the art world (with exhibitions, press articles, CV, facebook page, etc.). Beyond the conceptual aspect of his work, his approach focuses on the ephemeral nature of things, objects, lives. The artist’s recent research, into the production of snowflakes or reconstituted forsythias, reveal his constant interest in what is transitory or ephemeral. This poetic tendency is becoming more and more present in Scanlan’s work which always combines critical and independent standpoints.",Spring Line,Americas,"['box.n.01', 'idea.n.01', 'drawing.n.01', 'artwork.n.01', 'space.n.01', 'potential.a.01', 'mark.n.01', 'motif.n.01', 'conceptual.s.01', 'time.n.01', 'celebrated.s.01', 'degree.n.01', 'concept.n.01', 'subject.n.01', 'make.v.03', 'spectator.n.01', 'sculpture.n.01', 'piece.n.01']","['adaptation.n.02', 'influence.n.04', 'idea.n.01', 'stalk.n.02', 'flower.n.01', 'variation.n.07']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/img-684.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/img-684-232x300.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/spring-line/,"['Individual_Personal/13.314285714285717', 'Cultural/5.728937728937728', 'Material_Physical/3.228937728937729']","['Individual_Personal', 'Cultural', 'Material_Physical']",22.272161172161177,"['Values/5.12967032967033', 'Mind/5.107692307692307', 'Culture/3.269230769230769']","['Values', 'Mind', 'Culture']",13.506593406593407,"['Cultural/22.99256609403669', 'Individual_Personal/21.208058608058614', 'Material_Physical/6.312820512820513']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Material_Physical']",50.51344521491582,"['Values/8.577289377289377', 'Mind/7.953846153846154', 'Culture/7.154700854700855']","['Values', 'Mind', 'Culture']",23.68583638583639,1.0,1.0
Brian Jungen,"There are several elements to Subject, Silver, Prism. Silver ink is applied to blocks of black foam. A simple stand, reminiscent of cheap furniture, supports a drum constructed from deer hide stretched over plastic cooking bowls and held taut by the hide and twine. The tightness of the drum and the stiffness of its table offset the floppy softness of the black foam. The semantic and visual echo between the pots-and-pans drums of suburban children and the deer hide and wood drums of First Nations people are literally bound together in this piece.","Brian Jungen’s works create complex interrelationships between global consumer commodities and traditional First Nations objects. He often physically reworks brand-name products into forms associated with First Nations material culture, such as masks and teepees. More than a simple critique of American-European imperialism, Jungen’s hybrids are irreducible to either trajectory or even a one-way process of influence.","Subject, Silver, Prism",Americas,"['black.a.01', 'block.n.01', 'wood.n.01', 'simple.a.01', 'child.n.01', 'elements.n.01', 'construct.v.01', 'subject.n.01', 'ocular.a.02', 'people.n.01', 'piece.n.01']","['native.n.01', 'hybrid.n.02', 'commodity.n.01', 'artificial.s.03', 'natural.a.02', 'drum.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/brian_jungen_subject_silver_prism.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/brian_jungen_subject_silver_prism-216x300.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/subject-silver-prism/,"['Cultural/8.63064713064713', 'Society/4.230769230769231', 'Material_Physical/1.6333333333333333']","['Cultural', 'Society', 'Material_Physical']",14.494749694749693,"['Arts/3.228937728937729', 'Economy/2.6923076923076925', 'Design/2.307692307692308']","['Arts', 'Economy', 'Design']",8.22893772893773,"['Society/7.199145299145298', 'Cultural/7.017948717948718', 'Material_Physical/2.522222222222222']","['Society', 'Cultural', 'Material_Physical']",16.73931623931624,"['Economy/3.1717948717948716', 'Arts/2.371794871794872', 'Design/2.307692307692308']","['Economy', 'Arts', 'Design']",7.851282051282052,1.0,1.0
Elena Damiani,"The unstable transparency of the prints on silk chiffon is relative to the light and the viewer’s position, varying continually as we move around them. As apparitions or ghosts, the images portrayed appear or vanish in the space as fade-out recollections of a distant landscape. Hence, these impressions appear as oscillatory surfaces that fluctuate between presence and absence and contingent objects that shift as a result of what surrounds them.  The viewer struggles to grasp at once to the totality of the image, which keeps fusing with the space in the background. As a result, in Elena Damiani´s works function as constant reminders that it is only through the eyes of the present that we can catch a glimpse of the past and that both realms -virtual and physical- merge constantly in the act of remembrance.","Transforming found materials into collages, sculptures, videos, and installations, Elena Damiani critically addresses our understanding of the present via the potentiality of images from the past. She is interested in revising subjects such as geology, archaeology, and cartography—by reworking materials such as books, photographs, video footage, and public records—in order to stage fictions where multiple topographies and times unfold together, hovering between an indeterminate past and present. She aims to explore the ways in which specific materials can be staged as incomplete and ambiguous when extracted from their contexts, then recomposed into works that point out the manipulability of cultural objects and information, thereby forming new memory paths and connections.",Fading Fields 7,Americas,"['consequence.n.01', 'ghost.n.01', 'glance.n.01', 'space.n.01', 'changeless.s.02', 'eyes.n.01', 'print.n.01', 'function.n.01', 'position.n.01', 'background.n.01', 'presence.n.01', 'impression.n.01', 'surface.n.01', 'light.n.01', 'image.n.01', 'spectator.n.01', 'landscape.n.01', 'object.n.01']","['materiality.n.02', 'delusion.n.03', 'image.n.01', 'landscape.n.01', 'tangible.a.01', 'animalism.n.02']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/fading_field_7_1.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/fading_field_7_1-200x300.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/fading-field/,"['Material_Physical/7.223376623376622', 'Individual_Personal/4.852747252747252', 'Cultural/4.0307692307692315']","['Material_Physical', 'Individual_Personal', 'Cultural']",16.106893106893107,"['Materiality/4.566233766233766', 'Mind/2.3956043956043955', 'Culture/2.307692307692308']","['Materiality', 'Mind', 'Culture']",9.26953046953047,"['Individual_Personal/17.079853479853487', 'Cultural/15.014529914529916', 'Material_Physical/12.605305805305807']","['Individual_Personal', 'Cultural', 'Material_Physical']",44.6996891996892,"['Materiality/6.259706959706959', 'Mind/5.841758241758242', 'Culture/4.615384615384616']","['Materiality', 'Mind', 'Culture']",16.716849816849816,1.0,1.0
Jordan Kantor,"Lens Flare and the series Untitled Basel Lens Flare (6168, 5950, 7497) were part of a solo project by the artist presented at ArtBasel in 2009. Included in the Kadist Collection, these works continue to explore the ontology of the image to investigate the relationship between painting, photography, and a new time-based variable: film. Reduced here to the essential function of recording the exposure of light through the apparatus of a lens, Kantor then translated these film stills into painted colored canvases that retain the 3:4 aspect ratio of the 16mm film as well as the exact size of the projected image. The resulting paintings depict the “lens flares” in the film—the fleeting reflective glare inside the camera apparatus that results from when its lens is pointed directly at a bright light source.",Jordan Kantor’s artworks explore relationships between painting and photographic mediums. Unified by an overarching logic rather than a singular aesthetic approach—and strongly informed by art history—his interdisciplinary practice addresses discourses in contemporary image culture through the lens of conceptually-driven painting.,"Untitled, (Basel lens flare 5950, 6198, 7497)",Americas,"['lens.n.01', 'light.n.01', 'movie.n.01', 'brooding.s.01', 'research.v.02', 'function.n.01', 'beginning.n.04', 'photography.n.01', 'image.n.01', 'relationship.n.01', 'undertaking.n.01', 'camera.n.01', 'series.n.01']","['medium.n.01', 'light.n.01', 'flare.n.02', 'photography.n.01', 'lens.n.01', 'bright.a.01', 'moment.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/jordan_kantor_untitled_basel_lens_flare_5950.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/jordan_kantor_untitled_basel_lens_flare_5950-300x228.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/untitled-basel-lens-flare-5950-6198-7497/,"['Cultural/17.8134479297792', 'Material_Physical/2.569230769230769', 'Society/1.547008547008547']","['Cultural', 'Material_Physical', 'Society']",21.92968724601852,"['Technology/6.513725490196078', 'Media/5.992647058823529', 'Arts/4.507075380759591']","['Technology', 'Media', 'Arts']",17.013447929779197,"['Cultural/17.54345044360525', 'Individual_Personal/5.694852515905147', 'Material_Physical/4.371148459383753']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Material_Physical']",27.60945141889415,"['Media/5.050854700854701', 'Arts/4.604511278195488', 'Technology/3.980392156862745']","['Media', 'Arts', 'Technology']",13.635758135912933,0.6666666666666666,1.0
