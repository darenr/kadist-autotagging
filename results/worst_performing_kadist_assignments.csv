Robert Zhao Renhui,"Created during Zhao Renhui’s residency at Kadist SF in 2014, Zhao Renhui began observing and cataloguing insects inspired by the scientific impulse towards exhaustive taxonomy of Sacramento-based Dr. Martin Hauser, Senior Insect Biosystematist at the California Department of Food and Agriculture, and longtime acquaintance of the artist. In Villa Dei Fiori, September to November, Zhao Renhui tracked and collected multiple insects within the everyday urban environment, either finding the insects dead or following them around for few days.","Robert Zhao Renhui’s photographic prints question fact-based presentations of conservation and highlight the manner through which documentary, journalistic, or scientific reports sensationalize nature in order to elicit viewer sympathy. Zhao portrays human as figures curious about their natural environment, which is at times mysterious and unpredictable. Through observing human behavior in front of animals rather than that of the animals themselves, Zhao’s critical lens examines various modes of what he calls a “zoological gaze,” the manner through which humans view animals and nature. His works create visual ambiguity so the viewer becomes aware of assumptions made about the way images present facts. Zhao received a Bachelor of Fine Arts in photography at Caberwell College of Arts and a Masters degree at the London College of Communication, where he graduated with distinction.","Villa dei Fiori, September to November",Asia,"['food.n.01', 'california.n.01', 'multiple.a.01', 'inspire.v.01', 'urban.a.01', 'environment.n.01', 'everyday.s.01', 'make.v.03']","['science.n.01', 'nature.n.01', 'environment.n.01', 'representation.n.08', 'animal.n.01', 'ecology.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/image_zhao_renhui_villa_dei_fiori.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/image_zhao_renhui_villa_dei_fiori-300x200.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/villa-dei-fiori/,"['Cultural/16.595059008758703', 'Material_Physical/12.062091125249019', 'Individual_Personal/7.4919342095812675']","['Cultural', 'Material_Physical', 'Individual_Personal']",36.14908434358899,"['Arts/4.906862745098039', 'Technology/4.208333333333333', 'Physics/3.419883040935672']","['Arts', 'Technology', 'Physics']",12.535079119367044,"['Material_Physical/4.335775335775336', 'Society/1.7777777777777777', 'Cultural/1.0']","['Material_Physical', 'Society', 'Cultural']",7.113553113553114,"['Land/2.4126984126984126', 'Urbanization/1.7777777777777777', 'Culture/1.0']","['Land', 'Urbanization', 'Culture']",5.19047619047619,0.6666666666666666,0.0
Kristof Kintera,"Bad innovation in the name of protection is not a ready-made, but was made entirely by the artist, representing a stroller. Its interior is shielded and designed for babies in the case of conflict. Camouflaged, it resembles a small tank. Is it to protect or to attack? Is this object, full of ambiguity, for harmless babies or child soldiers? Privileged or excluded, this work alludes to survival and inequality faced by the question of life or death. The object materializes the primitive desire of protection induced by fear. How can we look at the world through this stroller? Is the pleasure of  seeing, breathing, feeling, still possible? Is it a shield to live, to survive or to go against life?","Kristof Kintera is a major artist of the contemporary Czech scene also with international acclaim. His works refer to doubts expressed in societies under authoritarian or communist regimes who find themselves in economic boom, yet leave behind local concerns. In the artist’s work, a sense of observation, often caustic, helps to establish a critical distance between oneself and the world, by using everyday objects cleverly diverted. Vivid and moving, the works of Kintera evoke primitive feelings of the human condition such as fear, desire for survival, and pleasure.Kristof Kintera was born in 1973 in the Czech Republic.

Saâdane Afif,"In this work, Saâdane Afif quotes André Cadere’s round wooden batons using the copy share and remix principles. Cadere’s sculptures, batons constituted with a mathematical chain of painted wood segments containing one error in the succession of colors, can be presented according to any possible configuration (on the wall, floor, hung or not). In the catalogue documenting the project, Power chords, there is a facsimile (another type of quotation) of one of Cadere’s conferences: “Présentation d’un travail, utilisation d’un travail” (presentation of a work, use of a work). The batons appear in different works by Afif like tools of an essential vocabulary: with nuances of black (Black spirit, 2004), of white (Ghost, 2005), translated into sound (Power chords, 2005) or light (Untitled 1971/2003-B 0230 1004 =30= =22×23=, 2003).  Saâdane Afif questions the generative capacity of error as the title suggests: A few more mistakes. He toys with some of the defining parameters of Cadere’s batons (nuances of grey, presentation as stalactites) in order to disrupt them. The title suggests that the work is in fact a portrait. Gilbert & George are two artists who perform and make photomontages about the concept of a couple. Afif pays homage to them via the minimal index of wooden batons as a reference to their notion of ‘living sculptures’.","Saâdane Afif practices the quote: “I belong to a generation of artists who {…} discuss art as a form of language, with which you play upon, you deform, you transform, without focusing on the object as it was before.” Such strategies of re-appropriation insert themselves inside a context of idea circulation, as a form of remixing and remaking. In the work “Pirates Who’s Who,” tactics of assemblage are recognizable on all levels. The artist makes use of an eccentric shelf by designer Ron Arad, displaying dripping paint on the wall while the shelf itself holds a collection of books on piracy, compiled together by the owner of the work. “Power chords” (2005), perhaps the most ambitious project by the artist to date, is both a work for publication and several exhibitions. The installation depicts automatic electric guitars, playing scores orchestrated by a computer program. The chords are defined by color sequences derived from André Cadere’s wooden segments. Yet with Afif’s displacement, the artist hints to the color and rhythmic sound dimensions vis-à-vis Cadere, inside a genre of synesthesia. In an age of numerical technology, Cadere’s rhythmic system echoes in a particular manner together with the processes of digitization. Afif suggests a principle of encoding the world underlying the real, or rhythmic language before the Tower of Babel. Saâdane Afif was born in 1970 in Vendome, France.

Young-Hae Chang Heavy Industries,"Pacific Limn weaves together three narratives that comment on hyper-capitalism pan-Pacific cities that San Francisco exemplifies. Each of the large works comprise of moving images overlaid with giant text, all synched to a stealthy, up-tempo jazz soundtrack. In The Secret Life of Harumi, a Japanese woman fantasizes escaping her job and living a temporary dream life in San Francisco. Young-Hae Chang Heavy Industries (YHCHI) uses locally sourced virtual products such as Adobe Flash animation and Apple’s Monaco or Menlo typeface to create a whimsical and indirect commentary on the psychology of the working class in an information society within postindustrial imperialism. For two months, YHCHI inhabited the economically polarized South of Market neighborhood, where a variety of socioeconomic realities overlap and coexist, from Facebook employees to the homeless. The Flash animation is influenced by realist cinema and depicts the tediousness in commuting by air and ground combined with the kitsch of an “Asia-town” window display. Overlaid with text-like femslash prose in a semi-coherent style of karaoke lyrics, the sensory cacophony disrupts a viewer’s thoughts and alludes to a desensitized boredom mixed with the desires of the alternative persona of a fictional Japanese woman.","Young-Hae Chang Heavy Industries is a Seoul-based Web art group consisting of Young-hae Chang and Marc Voge formed in 1999. Chang is a Korean artist and translator with a Ph.D in aesthetics from Universite de Paris I, and Marc Voge is an American poet living in Seoul. Their work tends to combine text with jazz to create Flash animation pieces.

Julius Koller,"The photograph Monologic – Yo-Yo 1, 2 (U.F.O.),(1982), shows Koller playing with a big white Yo-Yo in a drab concrete building among a group of tower blocks. For him, games like ping-pong or the yo-yo representsed the possibility of a more playful society in the face of socialist standardization.  Koller’s semiological manipulations of landscape and topography, of places and (his own) faces, investigate the possibilities of shifting meaning by the simplest alterations. In deadpan-humorist fashion, most poignantly displayed in a series of photo-portraits that cover a period of more than four decades, he systematically explores the relationship between art and alienation, or the idea of art as alienation. “U.F.O.-naut J.K.” becomes the artist’s altered ego, an extraterrestrial maker and distributor of universal signs: question marks, Ping-Pong balls, or wave lines, a more recent signature symbol, formed by tennis balls in a swimming pool in 1992 or drawn on the floor in the “antiperformance” Nova vaznost’, 1991.” (Tom Holert, Artforum, October, 2004).","In its stringency, obsession and peculiarity, the oeuvre of Julius Koller is one of the most idiosyncratic and consistent in European art since the 1960s. Yet Koller is not only a seminal figure in the history of the neo- and post-avant-garde; his work has long been a critical inspiration for artists and intellectuals. In the most recent past, Koller’s concepts of the Anti-Happening, the Anti-Picture, the Universal-cultural Futurological Operation (U.F.O.), his actions, objects, texts and the enormous referential archive he built up, have attracted growing interest on the part of a broader art public.  From around 1960, in response to the modernist mainstream in Slovak art, Julius Koller began to develop his aesthetic position of the “antihappening.” His strategy consists in using real objects and everyday life as the predefined program for an aesthetic operation: from 1965, in texts rubberstamped on paper that refer to the context of the “anti-happening,” and then in 1967/1968 in pictures for which Koller used white latex paint instead of oils and which saw the first appearance of the question mark—the symbol of Koller’s brands of naming, or “making known,” that was later to undergo many mutations in various media and states of aggregation. The “invitation cards for an idea”—as Koller called the text works relating to the “anti-happenings”—and the palimpsests and serial arrangements of the “anti-pictures” set themselves apart from the academicism of Modernism in more than just formal terms. Koller foregoes every form of technical mastery. The “anti-pictures” are amateurish in style, ensuring that they fulfill their task, defined by Koller as “engaging rather than arranging.”Julius Koller was born in 1939 in Piestany, Slovakia. He died in 2007 in Bratislava.","Monologika - Yoyo 1.,2.

Araya Rasdjarmrearnsook,"The Class (2005) by Araya Rasdjarmrearnsook challenges the viewer’s personal sense of morality and tolerance by depicting a classroom from hell. In the video, a woman, dressed in black with a white over shirt, stands in front of a long blackboard. The classroom’s rear walls and floor are covered in taut white fabric, given the room the sinister appearance of a sanitarium or a crime scene. Six bodies lay across the floor on silver morgue trays, their features all but obscured by gently draped white sheets. The woman at the front of the class begins to lecture to the lifeless bodies with a clear and calm diction. As she turns to address the rear wall, she grabs the chalk and writes her topic on the blackboard: death. She then proceeds with her monologue, discussing how death is addressed and approached from various historical, cultural, and philosophical perspectives. She occasionally addresses the lifeless bodies, imploring them to share their own perspectives and experiences. She continues to speak, undeterred by the lack of response or reciprocity. Deliberately absurdist in its premise, Rasdjarmrearnsook’s video parodies pedagogical conventions, and the metaphor here of the corpse-as-student plays off humorous tropes of being literally “bored to death.” But in opening a conversation about death – which is often considered too taboo to casually discuss in many cultures (and particularly in the West) – Rasdjarmrearnsook also questions how we treat conversations around mortality in public discourse and how those dialogues, while vital, all too often fall upon deaf ears until it is too late.","Araya Rasdjarmrearnsoon began producing film and video-based work in the 1990s. Her work considers a wide range of subjects but focuses in particular at populations that live on the margins and/or are marginalized by normative social structures, including women, the deceased, and people with disabilities. She even considers the rights of animals in her work and assumed hierarchies between species. Her narrative work confronts societal norms and structures of power and pedagogy.

As a symbol of the past there could be none more powerful than this. By carving into its floor, Kilpper laid bare its history by making images of its occupants and political figures associated with that period of history. Willy Brandt, Guenter Guillaume and Dietrich Sperling reminds us of all the intrigue of the Cold War when Brandt’s secretary Guillaume was passing secrets at the highest level to the East. Seen whispering in Brandt’s ear, he is perceived to be feeding false information. Sperling was a minister in Brandt’s government. The photograph on which the image is based was taken at the height of Guillaume’s treachery and treasonous conduct. The image of John Heartfield standing behind Silvio Berlusconi is based on a photomontage of Heartfield with the President of the Berlin Police Karl Zoergiebel of 1929 thus bringing together Heartfield, one of the greatest and most vivid critics of the Nazi era and manipulator of images through collage, with Berlusconi, one of the most rightwing, but freely elected leaders in Europe who manipulates the news and images through his media empire. These images are large scale and have a dramatic impact. In his use of woodcut, Kilpper’s work resonates with the large scale woodcuts of Christiane Baumgartner already in the collection.","Thomas Kilpper’s work engages with history and politics in a manner that recalls the 1960s in terms of his committed engagement. Typically Kilpper takes over a building and investigates its history, carving into the floor to make woodcuts which he then prints on a large scale onto fabric that floats free when he hangs it. In The Ring, a project he made in London in 2000, and of which the Tate bought a substantial part, he investigated the history of the area in which the building of the Tate was situated, making images connected with boxing (the site had previously housed a well known boxing ring), the Ministry of Defense (which had a secret printing press in the building) and Tate Modern (that was about to open around the corner). In Drowning Hercules he used bits of wood from Riddell House, a building about to be demolished to build an oversized tree which he located in the defunct swimming pool. Kilpper’s strategy is to work with buildings condemned for demolition and to use only materials he finds on site to make art. In that respect his work engages with the art of Gordon Matta-Clark but by inscribing himself into the building, rather than simply cutting it up, he puts forward a different point of view. He has no studio, is constantly on the move and starts each project from scratch. Research is a fundamental tool of his practice and the result is normally an artistic intervention into politics and history. Thus Kilpper combines a strong conceptual basis with considerable technical skill in making images that have dramatic impact and presence.  Thomas Kilpper was born in Stuttgart, Germany, in 1956.

Du Zhenjun,"The Tower of Babel is an installation of large-format photographs that forces the audience to occupy a central position through its monumental scale. These photographs present a series of urban landscapes and assembled Foucauldian structures of the present. Du sees the Tower of Babel as a continually reinvented narrative that warns people of “dangerous tendencies in the present time.” Du’s Babylonian towers resurrect from fallen rubbles of religious history in grand scale to focus on modern crises of civilization. Though the theme began with the struggle of monotheism over linguistic and geographic diversity in early human history, Babel in Du’s work has become a contemporary vision of catastrophic threat to the future of humanity.","Born in 1961, Du was trained as a painter and sculptor at the Institutes of Arts and Trades in Shanghai and the Fine Arts College at the University of Shanghai and garnered M.A. from the Regional School of Fine Arts of Rennes, France in 1999. Despite his classical training, Du became one of the first generation of artists to incorporate digital technologies into art pieces, producing interactive installations and describing digital media to be “a way of working on the dimension of power inherent to a society of information and new technologies.” Du’s works explore themes of “Modern Man” and human tragedy. Specifically, he highlights the ecstasy of human behavior in light of suffering and challenges in conveying what he calls the “universal human condition.”",The Tower of Babel: Destruction,Asia,"['scale.n.01', 'struggle.n.01', 'history.n.01', 'religious.s.01', 'position.n.01', 'vision.n.01', 'audience.n.01', 'future.n.01', 'modern.a.01', 'narrative.s.01', 'urban.a.01', 'structure.n.01', 'cardinal.s.01', 'contemporary.s.01', 'subject.n.01', 'human.a.01', 'people.n.01', 'landscape.n.01', 'photograph.n.01', 'time.n.01', 'series.n.01']","['destruction.n.01', 'war.n.01', 'death.n.01', 'debris.n.01', 'crisis.n.01', 'calamity.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/du_zhenjun_the_tower_of_babel_destruction_web.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/du_zhenjun_the_tower_of_babel_destruction_web-225x300.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/the-tower-of-babel-destruction/,"['Society/10.250976240298492', 'Material_Physical/6.1432180564533505', 'Individual_Personal/1.7777777777777777']","['Society', 'Material_Physical', 'Individual_Personal']",18.17197207452962,"['War/4.55', 'Violence/4.081928621250872', 'Environmental/3.6273809523809524']","['War', 'Violence', 'Environmental']",12.259309573631825,"['Cultural/15.387626589097184', 'Society/15.13675213675214', 'Material_Physical/12.891996891996893']","['Cultural', 'Society', 'Material_Physical']",43.416375617846214,"['Arts/6.561080586080586', 'Time/5.967210567210567', 'Urbanization/5.150427350427351']","['Arts', 'Time', 'Urbanization']",17.678718503718503,0.6666666666666666,0.0
Ibro Hasanovic,"Note on Multitude is a chilling black-and-white short movie recorded with a single camera in Prishtina, Kosovo, in 2015. The film, beginning in an unidentifiable location, shows a large, bustling and anxious crowd. Soon, the viewer is privy to the setting: a bus station. The film delicately depicts the intimate and emotional movements when families say goodbye, when individuals leave their homes, and when the future, one of a migrant, is unknown. The footage is haunting. The soundtrack to the film, what seems to be ever-increasing voices, conjures great anxiety about the subjects who are about to become migrants, heading towards Hungary, through Serbia, with the hopes to settle in Western Europe. As bodies fall upon each other, all anxious to take a spot in the next departing bus, the faces oscillate between absent waiting mostly seen on the faces of children who are passed into the bus from below, and the nervous faces of men trying to create order in chaos. Hasanovic deliberately deprives the viewer of information about the characters through a lack of dialogue to provide a global perspective of migration. The film implores the viewer to acknowledge and question how and why people seek refuge without providing an answer.","Ibro Hasanovic is a film, video, photographic and installation artist currently based in Brussels, Belgium, concerned largely with the powers of individual and collective memory. As a witness of recent global catastrophic history in Yugoslavia, Hasanovic’s practice is concerned largely with geopolitical and social concerns. His work focuses on micro-events, making History with a capital H graspable on the level of the personal, even anecdotal — a masterly technique described namely by Theodor Adorno and largely employed by seminal artists and writers throughout the 20th century — in an attempt to tackle with excruciating and torturous events such as war, loss, persecution, displacement and torture. Rather than addressing the full-blown horror of recent armed conflicts and ethnical belligerency in a moral or activist mode, the artist casts a closer look at what this entails for the individual or certain groups who are exposed to violence, or the sheer memory of it. Violence, when omnipresent, is not detected as being outrageous and blameful. Rather, ordinary people perceive it as a routinely performed act. Hasanovi? undermines the contemporary epoch that purports violence as a byproduct of politics; as a contemporary status quo.",Note on Multitude,Europe,"['movie.n.01', 'spectator.n.01', 'note.n.01', 'dialogue.n.01', 'unknown.a.01', 'europe.n.01', 'setting.n.01', 'western.a.01', 'short.a.01', 'global.s.01', 'footage.n.01', 'location.n.01', 'voice.n.01', 'future.n.01', 'child.n.01', 'individual.a.01', 'person.n.01', 'family.n.01', 'position.n.03', 'fictional_character.n.01', 'motion.n.03', 'camera.n.01', 'people.n.01', 'make.v.03', 'body.n.01']","['anxiety.n.01', 'supplanting.n.01', 'war.n.01', 'violence.n.01', 'refugee.n.01', 'persecution.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/ibro-hasanovic-01.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/ibro-hasanovic-01-300x169.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/note-on-multitude/,"['Society/13.171384437715707', 'Politics/8.64335499381939', 'Individual_Personal/4.204151404151404']","['Society', 'Politics', 'Individual_Personal']",26.0188908356865,"['Violence/6.344217160548429', 'War/3.7023809523809526', 'Power/3.107692307692308']","['Violence', 'War', 'Power']",13.154290420621688,"['Material_Physical/28.006202440490373', 'Politics/13.98039215686275', 'Cultural/10.928988005458594']","['Material_Physical', 'Politics', 'Cultural']",52.91558260281172,"['Space/11.389566298854227', 'Land/7.288888888888889', 'Time/5.2972222222222225']","['Space', 'Land', 'Time']",23.975677409965336,0.3333333333333333,0.0
Carolina Caycedo,"YUMA o la tierra de los amigos (YUMA, or the Land of Friends) is a large mural containing a series of satellite photographs mounted on acrylic. The mural contrasts and mixes multiple layers of these satellite images capturing the progressive devastation of the El Quimbo dam on the Yuma river (Magdalena), in the Department of Huila. The project was originally produced for the 8th Berlin Biennale, and developed out of the artist’s research into waterways, their political and cultural impact, and their historical development. In this work she focuses on the particular case of the El Quimbo Dam in Colombia, a dam along the Magdalena River and the first hydroelectric power project in Colombia to be constructed by a transnational, private corporation, signifying the transition of this geographically, ecologically and historically important public body of water into a privatized resource. The dam’s construction required the redirection of the Magdalena River, the main fluvial artery in the county, affecting a vast area and displacing the indigenous population of the region. Through this case, Caycedo investigates the destructive cultural and environmental consequences of erecting dams, as well as the desire to master the course of nature and the complicity of state power in quelling social unrest.","Carolina Caycedo engages with issues and contexts that affect a broad public on an everyday level: in her work, art functions as a pretext for offering up utopian models to inhabit a world in which individuals and communities are increasingly subject to com-modification, exploitation, and discrimination.","YUMA, or the Land of Friends",Americas,"['river.n.01', 'power.n.01', 'undertaking.n.01', 'population.n.01', 'region.n.01', 'private.a.01', 'passage.n.01', 'development.n.01', 'multiple.a.01', 'water.n.01', 'land.n.01', 'impact.n.01', 'desire.n.01', 'contrast.n.01', 'layer.n.01', 'produce.v.01', 'construction.n.01', 'construct.v.01', 'consequence.n.01', 'public.a.01', 'historical.a.01', 'nature.n.01', 'cultural.a.01', 'political.a.01', 'social.a.01']","['mapmaking.n.01', 'devastation.n.01', 'ecology.n.01', 'autochthonal.s.01', 'supplanting.n.01', 'exploitation.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_LOFMural-WEB.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_LOFMural-WEB-300x200.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/yuma-land-friends/,"['Politics/4.6', 'Individual_Personal/4.234920634920635', 'Cultural/3.298529411764706']","['Politics', 'Individual_Personal', 'Cultural']",12.133450046685342,"['Geopolitics/2.0', 'Familial/1.657142857142857', 'Identity/1.0']","['Geopolitics', 'Familial', 'Identity']",4.657142857142857,"['Individual_Personal/19.625030834318764', 'Society/18.442735188787825', 'Material_Physical/18.17603261032054']","['Individual_Personal', 'Society', 'Material_Physical']",56.243798633427126,"['Emotion/12.381618381618384', 'Arts/6.306435394670689', 'Economy/4.82457264957265']","['Emotion', 'Arts', 'Economy']",23.512626425861725,0.3333333333333333,0.0

Douglas Gordon,"Douglas Gordon’s single-channel video The Left Hand Can’t See That The Right Hand is Blind, captures an unfolding scene between two hands in leather gloves—at first seemingly comfortable to be entwined, and later, engaged in a struggle. As suggested by the work’s title, each of the hands assumes a character with a distinct personality, as if we were witnessing a lovers’ quarrel and embrace, or the embodiment of opposing forces of an internal struggle.  Gordon has previously created performance-based works depicting his own body or parts of it—arms, hands, fingers, eyes—usually enacting simple, repetitive movements. Hands, in particular, have held his interest due to their ability to evoke internal emotional states and express aspects of identity, sexuality, fetishism and even our ability to communicate. These characterizations suggested by simple movements reflect his ongoing interest in notions of the ego, and internal struggles—and are illustrative of the formal techniques of doubling and mirroring, which can be seen in several of his works.","Douglas Gordon is a celebrated Scottish artist whose work revolves around the themes of memory, time and our perception of it. Spanning across film, video, installation, photography, and sculpture, his work offers a new experience of the cinematic in the space of contemporary art, creating what critic Dominique Païni described as ‘exhibition cinema.’   Interested in how we experience temporality, Gordon has often slowed down either original or appropriated footage in order to play with the viewers’ perception. An example is his celebrated work 24 Hour Psycho (1993), in which Gordon stretched the duration of Alfred Hitchcock’s iconic movie to last 24 hours. This gesture both monumentalized time and intensified the imagery, structurally reframing the film by shifting our perception away from the movie’s original narrative and directing it towards the finer details that constitute every single frame.  Several of his works incorporate that universal dichotomies: of life and death, innocence and guilt, and dual identities. Harboring the tension between opposing forces, Gordon then employs formal strategies of repetition, mirroring, and doubling to construct a deliberate ambiguity and multiplicity of meaning.",The Left Hand Can't See That the Right Hand is Blind,Europe,"['hands.n.01', 'struggle.n.01', 'hand.n.01', 'motion.n.03', 'force.n.01', 'keep.v.01', 'formal.a.01', 'aspect.n.01', 'technique.n.01', 'simple.a.01', 'impression.n.01', 'identity.n.01', 'fictional_character.n.01', 'title.n.01', 'make.v.03', 'scene.n.01', 'body.n.01', 'video.n.01']","['hands.n.01', 'glove.n.02', 'leather.n.01', 'conflict.n.01', 'struggle.n.01', 'dominance.n.02', 'couple.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_Douglas-Gordon_Left-Hand-Cant-See-Right-Hand-Blind-WEB.png,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_Douglas-Gordon_Left-Hand-Cant-See-Right-Hand-Blind-WEB-300x240.png,https://kadist.org/work/left-hand-blind/,"['Politics/9.77008547008547', 'Society/6.691452991452992', 'Individual_Personal/3.971794871794872']","['Politics', 'Society', 'Individual_Personal']",20.43333333333333,"['Power/6.48974358974359', 'Inequality/2.4803418803418804', 'Environmental/2.307692307692308']","['Power', 'Inequality', 'Environmental']",11.277777777777779,"['Individual_Personal/19.30519806990396', 'Material_Physical/14.536000257052892', 'Cultural/11.201596279537458']","['Individual_Personal', 'Material_Physical', 'Cultural']",45.04279460649431,"['Space/8.045401966454598', 'Values/5.85845004668534', 'Identity/4.797979797979798']","['Space', 'Values', 'Identity']",18.70183181111974,0.3333333333333333,0.0
Zai Kuning,"Justice (2014) presents viewers with a curious assemblage: a wooden gallows with slightly curved spindles protruding from the topmost plank, which in turn is covered with rudimentary netting, the threads slackly dangling like a loose spider’s web or an rib cage that’s been cracked open. A bundle of small red rattan balls hang from the front end of the plank, precariously knotted to a single thread hanging from the gallows’ edge. A book hangs from similar red threads at the plank’s rear, its surfaced wrapped multiple times over with the thread to hold it in place, the red thread resembling blood vessels or connective tissue. A strange substance covers the book’s surface: translucent manila-hued beeswax that gives it a cream-colored luster. This assemblage bears anthropological significance, as Zai notes, Justice reimagines the life worlds of the Orang Laut, an indigenous nomadic tribe from Indonesia’s Riau Archipelago that migrates through maritime travel but that has become increasingly displaced and marginalized in recent years. Each component of his installation, by extension, draws inspiration from different objects that Zai found amongst the Orang Laut during his fifteen years of researching the tribe. Zai tellingly does not allow his work to slip entirely towards ethnography, and he does not describe the use value for these objects, presenting Justice instead as a creative rendering of the Orang Laut’s “world” through a composite of their accumulated ephemera. Justice functions as both an imaginary artifact as well as an artistic statement of resistance against forms of cultural imperialism that threatens to erase non-mainstream cultures.","Zai Kuning is one of Singapore’s leading avant-garde practitioners.

Leung Chi Wo and Wong Sara,"Office Lady with a Red Umbrella restages a figure from a 1980 postcard made from a photograph from 1950’s. The retro-glamor of the 1950s style is restyled devoid of the original context of a Hong Kong street scene, where the “office lady” is walking on Queens Road of the Central district. With the “office lady” facing away from the viewer with a bare background, an introspective tone is created in Leung’s restaging while highlighting the red umbrella resonating with a red pencil skirt emblematic of the identity of the professional urban woman when Hong Kong was under British rule.","Leung Chi Wo tends to highlight in his art the boundaries between viewing and voyeurism, real and fictional, and art and the everyday. Leung is generally concerned with aspects of photography that are not strictly visual and often considers the local population and sites in his photographic installations to reflect a deeper critical engagement with globalization and global consumerism. Working often with pinhole photography and mixed media while exploring cityscapes, Leung focuses on the emotional expressions of the urban man through figural portraiture.

Valérie Jouve,"Like many contemporary photographers who play with the codes of realism, Valérie Jouve composes her images, having already a more or less predetermined result in mind, in order to deliver a complex representation of the world instead of a bold presentation of facts. A part of the series “Les Figures”, this “portrait’ of P. Faure carries a strong ambiguity, typical of the photographer’s images, between realism and mise-en-scene.  This photograph is exemplary of Valérie Jouve’s work: inscription of an inidual within an urban landscape, relation to architecture, simplicity of composition and strong, yet imprecise narrativity – related in part to seemingly familiar characters or places. The position of the body is somewhat sculptural enhancing the impression of suspended movement, reminding of Walking man by Giacommeti. This reference is underlined by the man’s attitude, looking down, introspectively. The character’s intensity places him on the surface, as if he were stuck onto the landscape. Despite his being namely identified, the man seems as anonymous as the undefined background behind him.","Valérie Jouve has significantly contributed to the development of contemporary photography in France in the 1990s, by drawing a complex portrait of the city, through her series “Les Paysages”(Landscapes), “Les Passants” (Passers by), “Les Personnages” (Characters), “Les Figures” (Figures), “Les Façades” (Facades) or “Les Situations” (Situations). She tries to identify the inidual within a sociologically determined community and shows the relation of the body to the city.“I am interested by the question of space above all. However, inscribing the figure inside space is not only a formal question as one may think. It is mostly about understanding how the figure can give a presence to what surrounds it. Here architecture plays the role of an emblematic space, used by man to exist. Building and character, perspective and figure: what is at stake is the discrepancy between collective and inidual conscience, considered in aesthetic terms”. (Interview with Michel Poivert, Bulletin de la SFP, 7e série-N°1, October 1997)The straightforwardness characterizing the images of Valérie Jouve, her use of large formats (creating a physical relationship to the spectator) and her interest for « mise en scene » liken her practice to a contemporary combination of documentary aesthetics and dramaturgy, illustrating a distant and sometimes strange relation to the world.Valérie  Jouve was born in St Etienne, France, in 1964.

Park McArthur,"McArthur is not solely concerned with the limitations of the disabled, however, but sees the structures built (and missing) around disability access as part of a larger system of social and economic injustices. In her installation work Private Signs, McArthur appropriates shapes, colors, and geometries from familiar types of signage. Some of these signs—like a blue rectangle inside a green-bounded white box—are recognizable as handicapped access parking signs, while others are a bit more obscure in their composition. All of the signs in McArthur’s wall-sized installation take on the look of a minimalist, geometric painting, however, with the words, symbols, and directions stripped away to leave simplified arrangements.","American artist Park McArthur creates sculptures, sound, video, wall-based works, and writing that all grow out of her experience of everyday life. Responding to and working with the daily, McArthur uses her artistic practice as a way to critique and interrogate systems and conditions. Wheelchair-bound due to a form of muscular dystrophy, McArthur’s work, at times, deals with methods and limitation of access that the artist and others with disabilities face. Her New York gallery exhibition, Ramps (2014), consisted of portable wheelchair ramps borrowed from art spaces and institutions around the city. Placed in the gallery, directly on the floor, these portable ramps took on the look of Arte Povera sculptures, while also highlighting an issue important to the artist. During the run of the exhibition, the organizations that loaned the ramps also posted signs on their own buildings explaining the lack of wheelchair access, and pointing towards McArthur’s exhibition.",Private Signs,Americas,"['sign.n.01', 'geometric.s.01', 'type.n.01', 'agreement.n.04', 'leave.v.01', 'familiar.a.01', 'colors.n.01', 'symbol.n.01', 'economic.a.01', 'structure.n.01', 'shape.n.01', 'composition.n.01', 'construct.v.01', 'white.a.01', 'social.a.01']","['disability.n.01', 'handiness.n.02', 'inequality.n.01', 'minimalism.n.01', 'symbolism.n.01', 'injustice.n.02']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/privatesigns2014_web.png,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/privatesigns2014_web-300x268.png,https://kadist.org/work/private-signs/,"['Politics/3.6333333333333337', 'Individual_Personal/2.0', 'Society/0.8421052631578947']","['Politics', 'Individual_Personal', 'Society']",6.475438596491228,"['Inequality/2.8333333333333335', 'Body/2.0', 'Violence/0.8421052631578947']","['Inequality', 'Body', 'Violence']",5.675438596491229,"['Cultural/12.27394566218096', 'Society/5.217948717948718', 'Individual_Personal/3.279151404151404']","['Cultural', 'Society', 'Individual_Personal']",20.771045784281082,"['Design/5.849403537638832', 'Arts/4.8860805860805865', 'Economy/2.371794871794872']","['Design', 'Arts', 'Economy']",13.10727899551429,0.6666666666666666,0.0
Nicolás Grum,"El gran pacto de Chile (The Great Pact) and La balserita de Puerto Gala (The Raft) were part of the “Museo Futuro”, an exhibition in which the artist presented nine miniature dioramas staging fragments of Chile’s history, from its colonial invasions to the present. Through the episodes he chose to depict, the artist focused on historical narratives, the way the story is told, and the supposed irrefutability of historical facts.  Museo Futuro (“Future Museum”) stands within a tradition of artists who re-read history and offer their interpretation of it through the distopic lens of the museum display. “Future Museum is the vision of a fuzzy present seen from the distance of an impossible place,” says the artist. Playing with the way the mass media have represented certain of these events that compose Chilean history, and how this has engraved collective memory, the artist sets an ambiguous light of these “official” narratives, ranging from natural disasters, the decadence of art, politics, deceit and forgetfulness.  The use of an old fashioned media, miniature maquettes, evokes obsolete museology in an age where realistic images are omnipresent. It questions the format of representation, the museification of the present and the impact these events have on popular culture.","Through a variety of media (video, drawing, sculpture and installations), Nicolás Grum explores with a touch of sarcasm and humor, the dominant discourses coming from different circles of power — politics, history, economy and art — constantly putting into question the idea of authority and “truth”.",La balserita de Puerto Gala (The Raft),Americas,"['museum.n.01', 'future.n.01', 'event.n.01', 'narrative.n.01', 'historical.a.01', 'history.n.01', 'medium.n.01', 'lens.n.01', 'episode.n.01', 'age.n.01', 'mass.n.01', 'represent.v.01', 'picture.v.02', 'distance.n.01', 'display.n.01', 'fragment.n.01', 'format.n.01', 'politics.n.01', 'vision.n.01', 'impact.n.01', 'interpretation.n.01', 'popular.a.01', 'corporate.s.03', 'natural.a.01', 'tradition.n.01']","['history.n.01', 'incontrovertible.s.01', 'fact.n.01', 'colonialism.n.01', 'narrative.n.01', 'fiction.n.01', 'bias.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/nicolas_grum_cpax-11a_web.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/nicolas_grum_cpax-11a_web-199x300.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/balserita-puerto-gala/,"['Cultural/10.48622766122766', 'Society/5.959565580618212', 'Individual_Personal/2.475']","['Cultural', 'Society', 'Individual_Personal']",18.920793241845875,"['Fantasy/7.400757575757576', 'History/1.7777777777777777', 'Colonization/1.7777777777777777']","['Fantasy', 'History', 'Colonization']",10.95631313131313,"['Cultural/29.27773452038159', 'Material_Physical/20.894316794316794', 'Individual_Personal/17.639072039072044']","['Cultural', 'Material_Physical', 'Individual_Personal']",67.81112335377043,"['Time/10.996148296148295', 'Media/8.518288084464555', 'Mind/8.058852258852259']","['Time', 'Media', 'Mind']",27.573288639465108,0.6666666666666666,0.0
Amapola Prada,"In Amapola Prada’s work Movement, we see three spotlit, female bodies lying inert in a darkened room, alongside three dressed, standing figures holding long, wooden spoons. Looking over the static bodies, the standing figures place their spoons in-between the women’s legs and begin moving them in circular, rowing-like motion, like the oars of a boat.   The psycho-sexually charged nature of Movement is illustrative of Prada’s dream-like works, which often relate to the subconscious and other internal processes with which we express desires, tensions, and latent emotions. For Prada, our bodies are receptacles and hence the memories they carry, both symbolically and physically, are critical sources of information. In the case of Movement, the female body is portrayed as motionless and passive: akin to the wooden spoons, used as yet another inanimate tool.  Movement, alongside the works Unit/y and Power, forms part of the video triptych Revolution, where Prada investigates ideas commonly associated with the concept of ‘revolution.’ Contrasting the connotations these words carry with archetypal and symbolic situations, Prada proposes a revolution that departs from the body, advocating for “the acceptance of ourselves and our circumstances past and present, without pretenses or glories.”","As the daughter of an actor, Amapola Prada recalls frequently attending the theater as a child and noticing that she never saw herself (her body or reality) represented. On the same vein, during her studies in the field of Social Psychology at university, she noticed the lack of inclusion of non-Western subjectivities—mestizos, Indigenous, migrants among them—and their bodies across all the texts and theories she encountered.  Correspondingly, Prada turned to the languages of performance, theater, and video—combining them with her training in Psychology—to investigate, departing from the body, the plethora of meaning that simple movements and actions can contain. Across her performance and video work, Prada proposes that our bodies have been conditioned and carry imprints of discourses that determine race, social class and gender, and predetermine us as individuals. Her actions are attempts to strip our bodies of these preconditions or at least position her own expression as an opposing force to the history of oppression and repression which defines her body and her experience of everyday life in Lima, Peru.",Movement,Americas,"['wooden.s.01', 'motion.n.03', 'female.a.01', 'body.n.01', 'figure.n.01', 'critical.a.01', 'tool.n.01', 'desire.n.01', 'symbolic.a.01', 'tension.n.01', 'concept.n.01', 'situation.n.01', 'beginning.n.04', 'woman.n.01', 'idea.n.01', 'power.n.01', 'nature.n.01', 'memory.n.01', 'procedure.n.01', 'video.n.01']","['psychology.n.01', 'body.n.01', 'movement.n.04', 'memory.n.01', 'revolution.n.01', 'mother.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/amapola_prada_movement_i_web.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/amapola_prada_movement_i_web-300x169.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/movement/,"['Material_Physical/16.28018122228649', 'Cultural/11.593411129634042', 'Individual_Personal/9.715506715506717']","['Material_Physical', 'Cultural', 'Individual_Personal']",37.58909906742725,"['Space/7.146153846153846', 'Physics/4.784576826682089', 'Mind/4.316239316239316']","['Space', 'Physics', 'Mind']",16.24696998907525,"['Individual_Personal/46.932900432900425', 'Cultural/25.70566688213748', 'Material_Physical/20.227228327228335']","['Individual_Personal', 'Cultural', 'Material_Physical']",92.86579564226624,"['Emotion/13.181618381618385', 'Values/10.177289377289377', 'Culture/9.541758241758243']","['Emotion', 'Values', 'Culture']",32.90066600066601,1.0,0.0
Fang Lu,"No World is an action-filled video work filmed inside an abandoned museum in the Songzhuang area outside Beijing. Without using any dialogue, Lu created an artificial scenario where she instructed actors with a list of tasks to gesturally mime scenes from news and journalistic images outside China. Through an intuitive self-trained mimicry, these acts simultaneously became moves in a game as well as a daily routine. No World points to the changing roles of the camera from a device originally invented to memorialize a moment to a tool that situationally creates an event. The performance of violence, conflicts and human relationships in the confined space blurs the boundary between the gallery and everyday life, between staged performance and documentary footage. The work is also a metaphor for a desire in today’s youth to go beyond their controlled, mediated environment and perform chaos in order to heighten their existential awareness.","Lu Fang grew up in a family of Chinese ink painters. Reacting to her upbringing upon exposure to video art, Lu decided to pursue art education in the United States in graphic design and new genres. Fang’s practice consists of video works that explore the way media and performance impact love and human relationships in desolate, insular environments such as deserts or abandoned museums. She often creates site-specific situations where she directs her actors to perform certain tasks or speak on a given theme, paying particular attention to female voice and subjectivity. Furthermore, the staging of her camera work zooms in on the way contemporary media dictate narrative creation that shifts incessantly between the domestic and the exotic, quotidian and supernatural.",No World,Asia,"['performance.n.01', 'everyday.s.01 life.n.01', 'dialogue.n.01', 'perform.v.01', 'actor.n.01', 'tool.n.01', 'documentary.a.01', 'china.n.01', 'footage.n.01', 'desire.n.01', 'daily.s.01', 'game.n.01', 'metaphor.n.01', 'violence.n.01', 'museum.n.01', 'environment.n.01', 'everyday.s.01', 'event.n.01', 'function.n.03', 'moment.n.01', 'relationship.n.01', 'undertaking.n.01', 'camera.n.01', 'human.a.01', 'scene.n.01']","['apery.n.01', 'everyday.s.01', 'news.n.01', 'conflict.n.01', 'violence.n.01', 'memorialize.v.01', 'reenact.v.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/IMG_Fang-Lu-No-World-Photo-Series-02-2014-Photography-inkjet-Innova-Ultra-Smooth-Gloss-Paper-120x80cm-edition-of-1_8_WEB.png,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/IMG_Fang-Lu-No-World-Photo-Series-02-2014-Photography-inkjet-Innova-Ultra-Smooth-Gloss-Paper-120x80cm-edition-of-1_8_WEB-300x200.png,https://kadist.org/work/no-world/,"['Politics/6.241176470588235', 'Society/6.188254030709274', 'Cultural/3.1956043956043954']","['Politics', 'Society', 'Cultural']",15.625034896901905,"['Violence/2.8745098039215686', 'Power/2.7333333333333334', 'Activism/2.574509803921569']","['Violence', 'Power', 'Activism']",8.18235294117647,"['Society/21.404937872584938', 'Individual_Personal/20.66108628213892', 'Cultural/15.252747252747255']","['Society', 'Individual_Personal', 'Cultural']",57.31877140747112,"['Emotion/12.381618381618384', 'Land/5.784718205770837', 'Economy/4.955672268907563']","['Emotion', 'Land', 'Economy']",23.122008856296784,0.6666666666666666,0.0
Michal Chelbin,"Michal Chelbin’s staged yet intimate portrait photographs, seduce the viewer into uncomfortable, voyeuristic complicity with the camera. Several works represent adolescent girls on the verge of sexual consciousness, their bodies still that of a child while their gaze directly confronts the viewer implying differently. Michal Chelbin shoots in a format of utter stability-the square. She positions her subjects well within the frame where visual clarity prevails. Angelina and her father, Israel belongs to the “Strangely Familiar” series where she shifted form shooting in the studio to the outside world, from theatrical to found light. In this work, an athletic but vulnerable-looking man holds his daughter in front of a swamp, poised as if offering her to the viewer.  Though the photographs remain staged and her efforts directorial, Chelbin has sublimated the work’s mythic aspects by exploring a world of characters that lend themselves readily to the romantic-the world of athletes, ballroom dancers, and performers in small traveling shows and circuses, mostly in Eastern Europe, but also in Israel and England. With little supporting information to go on, we reflexively fill in the blanks and ride the images’ narrative momentum wherever it leads. Much of the time taking us to places steeped in discontinuity, incongruity, ambiguity. Places of subtle, underlying tension between the odd and the ordinary.",Michal Chelbin was born in 1974 in Israel.
