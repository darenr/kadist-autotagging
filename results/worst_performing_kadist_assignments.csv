Karl Haendel,"Haendel’s series Knights (2011) is a set of impeccably drafted, nine-foot-tall pencil drawings depicting full suits of armor. The series riffs on previous investigations by the artist such as his meticulous depictions of masculine political figures, which included a headless J. Edgar Hoover and a Hitler head floating vulnerably in the center of a white expanse (Hitler’s iconic mustache was crafted from the artist’s pubic hair). Rendered in soft graphite, the imposing Knights embody the ostensibly conflicting ideals of chivalrous deference and invulnerable masculinity.","An expert draftsman well versed in semiotics, Karl Haendel strategically manipulates tangled visual, material, and textual themes, often to humorous and evocative effect. His juxtapositions are as resonant as they are unexpected, whether they take the form of layered graphite drawings, video, or installation. Haendel’s distinct brand of honest humor, honed in his current hometown of Los Angeles, is rooted in the rigorous studies he undertook at Brown University (BA), UCLA (MFA), and the Whitney Independent Study Program.",Knight #6,Americas,"['hair.n.01', 'probe.n.01', 'soft.a.01', 'render.v.01', 'head.n.01', 'set.n.01', 'center.n.01', 'iconic.a.01', 'series.n.01', 'white.a.01', 'political.a.01', 'figure.n.01', 'drawing.n.01']","['epic.s.01', 'masculinity.n.02', 'vulnerability.n.01', 'drawing.n.02', 'invulnerability.n.02', 'armor.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/karl_haendel_knight6_0.jpeg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/karl_haendel_knight6_0-235x300.jpeg,https://kadist.org/work/knight-6/,"['Cultural/4.615686274509804', 'Individual_Personal/2.347008547008547', 'Politics/2.307692307692308']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Politics']",9.27038712921066,"['Identity/2.347008547008547', 'Power/2.307692307692308', 'Design/1.8823529411764706']","['Identity', 'Power', 'Design']",6.537053795877325,"['Material_Physical/4.764835164835165', 'Cultural/2.569230769230769', 'Society/2.426373626373626']","['Material_Physical', 'Cultural', 'Society']",9.76043956043956,"['Land/2.307692307692308', 'Arts/1.7692307692307692', 'Space/1.657142857142857']","['Land', 'Arts', 'Space']",5.734065934065933,0.3333333333333333,0.0

Julius Koller,"Anti-Happening refers to Koller’s 1965 manifesto, ‘Anti-Happening (System of Subjective Objectivity)’. In opposition to the notion of a ‘happening’ as a way of actualising group identity, in his manifesto, Koller stated that his concept of the ‘anti-happening’ aimed at a ‘cultural reshaping of the subject, at awareness, at the surroundings and the real world’ [i]. Unlike happenings, these actions do not involve the staging of psychologically expressive performances.  As the art historian Piotr Petrowski has noted, it is part of ‘an attitude that aims to erase the boundaries between different art tendencies (art and anti-art, modernist and neo-avant-garde painting), between different forms of neo-avant-garde practice (performance, conceptual art, Fluxus) and, above all, between art and life’[ii].  [i] Kathrin Rhomberg and Roman Ondák (eds.), Julius Koller: Univerzálne Futurologické Operácie, Cologne 2003. p.126.    [ii] Piotr Piotrowski, In the Shadow of Yalta: Art and the Avant-Garde in Eastern Europe, 1945–1989, London 2009.","In its stringency, obsession and peculiarity, the oeuvre of Julius Koller is one of the most idiosyncratic and consistent in European art since the 1960s. Yet Koller is not only a seminal figure in the history of the neo- and post-avant-garde; his work has long been a critical inspiration for artists and intellectuals. In the most recent past, Koller’s concepts of the Anti-Happening, the Anti-Picture, the Universal-cultural Futurological Operation (U.F.O.), his actions, objects, texts and the enormous referential archive he built up, have attracted growing interest on the part of a broader art public.  From around 1960, in response to the modernist mainstream in Slovak art, Julius Koller began to develop his aesthetic position of the “antihappening.” His strategy consists in using real objects and everyday life as the predefined program for an aesthetic operation: from 1965, in texts rubberstamped on paper that refer to the context of the “anti-happening,” and then in 1967/1968 in pictures for which Koller used white latex paint instead of oils and which saw the first appearance of the question mark—the symbol of Koller’s brands of naming, or “making known,” that was later to undergo many mutations in various media and states of aggregation. The “invitation cards for an idea”—as Koller called the text works relating to the “anti-happenings”—and the palimpsests and serial arrangements of the “anti-pictures” set themselves apart from the academicism of Modernism in more than just formal terms. Koller foregoes every form of technical mastery. The “anti-pictures” are amateurish in style, ensuring that they fulfill their task, defined by Koller as “engaging rather than arranging.”Julius Koller was born in 1939 in Piestany, Slovakia.

Young-Hae Chang Heavy Industries,"Pacific Limn weaves together three narratives that comment on hyper-capitalism pan-Pacific cities that San Francisco exemplifies. Each of the large works comprise of moving images overlaid with giant text, all synched to a stealthy, up-tempo jazz soundtrack. In The Secret Life of Harumi, a Japanese woman fantasizes escaping her job and living a temporary dream life in San Francisco. Young-Hae Chang Heavy Industries (YHCHI) uses locally sourced virtual products such as Adobe Flash animation and Apple’s Monaco or Menlo typeface to create a whimsical and indirect commentary on the psychology of the working class in an information society within postindustrial imperialism. For two months, YHCHI inhabited the economically polarized South of Market neighborhood, where a variety of socioeconomic realities overlap and coexist, from Facebook employees to the homeless. The Flash animation is influenced by realist cinema and depicts the tediousness in commuting by air and ground combined with the kitsch of an “Asia-town” window display. Overlaid with text-like femslash prose in a semi-coherent style of karaoke lyrics, the sensory cacophony disrupts a viewer’s thoughts and alludes to a desensitized boredom mixed with the desires of the alternative persona of a fictional Japanese woman.","Young-Hae Chang Heavy Industries is a Seoul-based Web art group consisting of Young-hae Chang and Marc Voge formed in 1999. Chang is a Korean artist and translator with a Ph.D in aesthetics from Universite de Paris I, and Marc Voge is an American poet living in Seoul. Their work tends to combine text with jazz to create Flash animation pieces. This combination is a simple technique that shuns interactivity, graphics, photos, illustrations, banners, colors, but at the same time transgresses the boundaries between digital animation, motion graphics, experimental video, i-movies, and e-poetry.",PACIFIC LIMN,Asia,"['japanese.a.01', 'san_francisco.n.01', 'woman.n.01', 'window.n.01', 'film.n.02', 'life.n.01', 'virtual.s.01', 'air.n.01', 'market.n.01', 'display.n.01', 'south.n.01', 'dream.n.01', 'land.n.04', 'fictional.a.01', 'desire.n.01', 'society.n.01', 'manner.n.01', 'world.n.03', 'narrative.n.01', 'city.n.01', 'make.v.03', 'spectator.n.01']","['fantasy_life.n.01', 'gentrification.n.01', 'desensitization.n.01', 'line.n.05', 'animation.n.05', 'kitsch.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/japan_1_web.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/japan_1_web-300x169.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/pacific-limn/,"['Cultural/13.015452847805792', 'Individual_Personal/3.202614379084967', 'Material_Physical/2.3790849673202614']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Material_Physical']",18.59715219421102,"['Arts/6.131302521008403', 'Language/2.666666666666667', 'Fantasy/2.593954248366013']","['Arts', 'Language', 'Fantasy']",11.391923436041083,"['Individual_Personal/23.158175158175165', 'Cultural/19.75951287274817', 'Society/18.017289452893166']","['Individual_Personal', 'Cultural', 'Society']",60.9349774838165,"['Emotion/13.181618381618385', 'Land/11.20237017884077', 'Media/8.072125260360554']","['Emotion', 'Land', 'Media']",32.45611382081971,0.6666666666666666,0.0
Felipe Arturo,"Defined as entropy, the second law of thermodynamics proposes that energy is more easily dispersed than it is concentrated. One basic illustration of entropy is to imagine white and black sand: once mixed together, it is highly unlikely that the contrasting grains of sand can be separated and restored to their original distinct color groups. Arturo’s Trópico Entrópico (Entropic Tropics, 2012) considers the colonization of the American continent as a similarly irreversible process of cultural entropy. His inspiration derives from a place near Manaus in the Brazilian Amazon, where the Black River meets with the sandy-colored Solimões River, producing a river of two colors that extends over ten kilometers. In the late nineteenth century, the Brazilian rubber barons decided to commemorate this impressive natural phenomenon by covering the main square of Manaus with a design of black-and-white waveforms made from stones. The square is known as the Encontro das aguas (Meeting of the Waters). Decades later, Roberto Burle Marx used this same pattern in his famous Copacabana walkway in Rio de Janeiro. Since then, the design has spread across the continent to Lima, Bogotá, Cali, and beyond. Trópico entrópico uses this pattern to produce entropy in the exhibition space. Sugar, the material used, signifies one of many economic motivators for colonialism. Visitors are invited to collectively dissolve this modern design by walking on the brown and white sugar, and participating in its entropic mixing.","Felipe Arturo considers elements from urbanism, architecture, and art in relation to politics, history, geography, and economy. His works and projects often manifest as sculptures, installations, or videos, departing from concepts such as structure, sequence, and matter. They are deeply influenced by vernacular architecture and construction techniques, and reflect processes of assimilation and resistance to colonial and postcolonial processes. He frequently combines the language and materials of Modernism (e.g., concrete) with the informal methods of autoconstrucción (self-construction).",Trópico entrópico,Americas,"['design.n.01', 'square.n.01', 'form.n.03', 'white.a.01', 'invite.v.01', 'black.n.01', 'visitor.n.01', 'phenomenon.n.01', 'produce.v.01', 'imagine.v.01', 'century.n.01', 'economic.a.01', 'rock.n.01', 'colors.n.01', 'celebrated.s.01', 'natural.a.01', 'american.a.01', 'modern.a.01', 'color.n.01', 'original.s.01', 'black.a.01', 'cultural.a.01', 'procedure.n.01', 'material.n.01', 'space.n.01']","['disorder.n.01', 'sugar.n.01', 'colonialism.n.01', 'form.n.03', 'floor.n.01', 'history.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/felipe_arturo_tropico_entropico_web.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/felipe_arturo_tropico_entropico_web-300x200.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/tropico-entropico/,"['Society/7.5523257616136865', 'Politics/4.016965490649701', 'Cultural/2.6527777777777777']","['Society', 'Politics', 'Cultural']",14.222069030041165,"['Violence/2.4656346749226006', 'Power/2.307692307692308', 'History/1.7777777777777777']","['Violence', 'Power', 'History']",6.551104760392686,"['Cultural/15.068060044530636', 'Material_Physical/14.653724053724059', 'Individual_Personal/11.372161172161174']","['Cultural', 'Material_Physical', 'Individual_Personal']",41.09394527041587,"['Space/7.235042735042734', 'Arts/5.534640522875817', 'Time/4.123809523809524']","['Space', 'Arts', 'Time']",16.893492781728074,0.3333333333333333,0.0
Qiu Anxiong,"A Portrait: Covering and Cleaning is an installation of six black-and-white video projections. Each video depicts a portrait with features changing continuously and quickly into different persons, animals and symbols. Driven by the evolving contents of the screen itself, this piece showcases the form and material of Qiu Anxiong’s working method, which relies on precisely planned storyboard sketches drawn in pen on A4 paper. After the narrative is fully formed, Qiu transfers each image by painting it onto a small canvas with acrylic, which can be quickly wiped away to prepare for the subsequent image or element to be painted on top. Such process distills an aesthetics of over-painting that drives narrative development through changing logical relationships between material and form rather than plot elements.","Qiu Anxiong is part of a new generation of Chinese artists synthesizing Chinese culture and history with global contemporary art through addressing new utopias produced by real conditions of globalization. After studying at the Sichuan Art Academy in Chongqing, China and graduating with emphases in contemporary international art and traditional Chinese culture from University of Kassel’s College of Art in Germany, Qiu rose to international prominence in the 2006 Shanghai Biennial with a video work titled New Book of the Mountains and Seas.

Andrew Grassie,"In 2008, Grassie was invited by the Whitechapel Gallery to document the transformation of some of its spaces. The artist chose to depict the space before and after, thus creating the series titled “After the Archive Collections Room.” This group of paintings displays a space locked into time with its scaffolding and broom exposed, depicted just before an exhibition on a collection of archives.","The hyper-realistic paintings of Andrew Grassie combine know-how and classic technique with a conceptual approach. “Painting as document” as the artist suggests consists of exhibition or studio views that are photographed and maintain their same scale. The question of the exhibition, the choice of works, and their hanging appears central to Andrew Grassie who like a curator creates protocols to create his series. In “Group Show” (2003), he assembles a group of works, photographs them one by one, and uses the photographic support putting as a matrix for further paintings.  The exhibition only exists through this final painting, like in his other project “Tate New Hang” (2004-05) which shows points of view of the hanging of the collection, later to be realized to be in painting. The paintings are hung in the location suggested by the terms described.  Andrew Grassie was born in 1966 in Edinburgh, UK.

Sergio De La Torre,"Nuevo Dragon City is a reenactment of a historical event from 1927 in which six Chinese were either trapped or voluntarily hid themselves inside a building in northern Mexico. Working with this unsettled mystery, De La Torre’s video inquires into the historical and continuing tensions between Chinese and Mexicans. As such, Nuevo Dragon City depicts a symbolic act of self-entrapment in which six untrained actors of Chinese descent silently blockade themselves inside in an empty Tijuana storefront. As they close off the outside world, their surroundings and actions become a powerful commentary on the social reality of immigrants.","Sergio De La Torre has worked with and documented the manifold ways in which citizens reinvent themselves in the city they inhabit, as well as the site-specific strategies they deploy to move “in and out modernity.”  De La Torre often collaborates with his subjects, resulting in both intimate and critical reflections on topics like housing, immigration, and labor.

Sun Xun,"Sun’s animated film 21 Ke (21 Grams) is based on the 1907 research by the American physician Dr. Duncan MacDougall who claimed the measured weight of the human soul to be twenty-one grams. Sun used this episode—which was not fully recognized by the scientific community—as a point of departure for his depiction of a dystopian world in which the narration of history and notion of time are interrupted. Because each frame was drawn by hand with crayon, it took Sun and his animation studio team a few years to complete this thirty-minute film of a surreal journey through mysterious cities, plagues of mosquitoes, broken statues, cawing ravens, waving flags, and flooded graveyards. Here, an ever-present man in a top hat makes obscure, cryptic references in scenarios that include the national anthem, factories belching soot into the threatening sky, and soaring planes dropping leaflets to earth. Rather than encouraging specific interpretations, 21 Ke is a visual commentary that asks essential questions of human existence: Who we are? What have we done? Where are we heading?","Sun Xun creates videos and animation films from his meticulous, highly detailed, and often monochromatic, hand drawings executed in ink, oil, and crayon. Drawing on the ideas of thinkers like Karl Marx, Theodor Adorno, and Max Horkheimer, Sun investigates revolution, existence, mythologies of society, the notion of time, and the construction and narration of history. Often in a style of magical realism, Sun’s works are full of metaphors and indirect visual associations that beg to be deciphered. He graduated from the print making department of the China Academy of Fine Art in 2005, and, a year later, established ? Animation Studio.

William E. Jones,"Killed is a video projection in which William E. Jones appropriated and edited, in a rapid sequence, a selection from the more than 68,000 censored or discarded films produced by the Farm Security Administration’s photographers between 1935 and 1943. Roy Emerson Stryker, the then director of the program, was in charge of what he called “killing” negatives by punching holes in them to render them unusable. Killed continues Jones’s use of discarded film footage seen in his video created from vintage 1970s and 1980s gay porn that was included in the 2008 Whitney Biennial. By recuperating lost and rather unseen pictures by emblematic American photographers such as Walker Evans, Theodor Jung, Carl Mydans, among others, Killed sheds a new light on the way American history has been written and the crucial role images have played in it.","Los Angeles-based artist and filmmaker William E. Jones appropriates vintage film material that he rearranges into new compositions. Often concerned with the way gay imagery was depicted in 1970s and 1980s, Jones’s early films explore the complex configuration of homosexual identity with a rather nostalgic and romanticized gaze.

Jennifer Locke,"Choke documents the artist filming a wrestler “choking out” his teammate until he is unconscious. This closed circuit of dominance and submission between two powerful men, is echoed by the closed circuit of the video through which the viewer takes on the role of voyeur. The artist’s presence in the piece not only calls attention to its staging, but inverts the traditional power dynamic of the “male gaze” and gender roles.","Working in video and installation-based performance, Jennifer Locke stages physically intense actions in relation to the camera and specific architecture in order to explore the unstable nature of artist/model/camera/audience hierarchies. These actions focus on cycles of physicality and visibility, and draw from her experiences as a professional dominatrix, champion submission wrestler, and artist’s model. Locke often creates a separation between her live actions and the audience through the use of material barriers, live video feeds, multiple camera perspectives, wireless microphones, and mini-cameras. These audio-visual reiterations produce a ripple effect, flattening, repeating, echoing, amplifying, and displacing the action by turning it —as well as the audience performing its own spectatorship— into an image of itself.",Choke,Americas,"['function.n.03', 'gaze.n.01', 'traditional.a.01', 'document.n.01', 'attention.n.01', 'power.n.01', 'presence.n.01', 'spectator.n.01', 'piece.n.01', 'video.n.01']","['sex.n.04', 'wrestling.n.02', 'voyeurism.n.01', 'violence.n.01', 'gaze.n.01', 'film.v.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/jennifer_locke_choke_.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/jennifer_locke_choke_-300x204.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/choke/,"['Individual_Personal/4.8', 'Society/2.7411764705882353', 'Politics/2.541176470588235']","['Individual_Personal', 'Society', 'Politics']",10.08235294117647,"['Body/3.0', 'Violence/1.9411764705882353', 'Activism/1.7411764705882353']","['Body', 'Violence', 'Activism']",6.682352941176471,"['Material_Physical/6.825940725940725', 'Cultural/6.376923076923077', 'Individual_Personal/5.123809523809523']","['Material_Physical', 'Cultural', 'Individual_Personal']",18.326673326673326,"['Materiality/3.4025641025641025', 'Power/2.511655011655012', 'Language/2.307692307692308']","['Materiality', 'Power', 'Language']",8.221911421911422,0.3333333333333333,0.0

Tina Modotti,"The Italian photographer Tina Modotti is known for her documentation of the mural movement in Mexico. She had a keen eye for architectural composition, and captured eloquent details using a delicate platinum print process. In 1929 she was deported from Mexico because of her involvement in the Communist party and went to Europe. Soon thereafter her work began to blend her eye for space and shape with a more critical social angle, often engaging in an overtly anti-Fascist discourses. Untitled (Cathedral) (ca. 1930), taken after her arrival in Europe, is an excellent example of her skillfully composed architectural pictures. It evokes ideas about how the composition of public spaces can influence both politics and cultural life.","Tina Modotti was an Italian film actress and photographer. As a photographer, she collaborated with Edward Weston and extensively documented the Mexican mural movement. In addition to her photography of Diego Rivera’s murals, she is also depicted in five of them. Modotti was involved in both the artistic and political avant-gardes of Mexico City, befriending members of and eventually joining the Mexican Communist party. Political repression forced her to move back to Europe, and she eventually lived in Moscow before moving to Spain when the Civil war began in 1936.

Barry McGee,"Barry McGee’s Untitled is a collection of roughly fifty, framed photographs, paintings, and text pieces clustered together in corner. Its tiled effect can perhaps be seen as a vertical Carl Andre work and also bears some resemblance to another work in the Kadist Collection, Jedediah Caesar’s JCA-25-SC. McGee’s installation also echoes the votive altars in the chapels he visited during his residency in Brazil in 1993.

Maayan Amir & Ruti Sela,"In Beyond Guilt the two artists create a portrait of our generation in three parts. In Tel Aviv, in confined spaces such as toilets or bar of hotel rooms, they create situations in which participants answer questions and describe themselves. Camera in hand, there is little editing in their works, leaving a rather crude result. The camera becomes the witness of exchange between the participants and the artists in a relationship of power and seduction. These people could easily have counterparts in Western societies. Yet, what is ultimately disturbing is the contradiction between a very light form of life turned to pleasure, sex, or transgression and violence. One in which we perceive the trauma of a permanent war, a conflict sometimes assumed and claimed.","Maayan Amir and Ruti Sela, two young Israeli women artists work collaboratively or individually by project. Shot in Tel Aviv, their short videos report contradictions of a society defined by power relations, commonly featuring subjects like artists and models, men and women, and the private and public domain. Their films offer a fresh examination of the influence of occupation, terror, and the army in Israeli identity. Even in the most private moments, sexual identity and political identity are inextricably linked in their works. For their latest project “Exterritory,” the two artists left their cameras in distinct locations to collectively investigate space beyond borders in different neighboring countries at war. This utopian project exists only in a temporary situation, a place located in transit across the maritime horizons. There, Maayan Amir and Ruti Sela, other artists and curators, met to develop a film program centering on the concept of extraterritoriality. The first program “Exterritory” was held June 17 to 21, 2010, (coincidentally a few days after the Israeli attack of the fleet on its way to Gaza) on a ship that traveled from Israel to Cyprus.
