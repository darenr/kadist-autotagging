Abdul Abdullah,"This large portrait of a man, caught as though in mid-conversation, is titled Caliban, after a central character in Shakespeare’s play The Tempest. Caliban is a half-human ‘mooncalf’, son of the witch Sycorax and the sole inhabitant of the island on which he was born until a storm shipwrecks father and daughter, Prospero and Miranda, there. Caliban functions in the play as a ridiculed and disempowered outsider – the ‘other’ to Prospero’s Eurocentric assumption of authority. By dint of its title, Abdul Abdullah’s portrait positions its subject as the marginalised and oppressed figure in an unequal power relation. Abdullah, a seventh-generation Australian of Muslim background, identified with the oppressed Caliban while in high school. He has referenced the character in a number of his works, referring to himself and his brothers in one self-portrait as Sons of Sycorax. Abdullah was 14 when the September 11 terrorist attacks occurred. He came of age at a time of hostility and suspicion towards Muslims in Australia, when, as he has noted, “you couldn’t open a newspaper, turn on the television or listen to the radio without being reminded you were the bad guy and that you were frankly unwelcome. The war on terror felt like a war on you.” The politicisation of his identity as the ‘bad guy’ has led Abdullah to create works – mostly portraits and self-portraits – critiquing Islamophobic depictions of Muslim youth in Australia. His work has challenged viewers’ expectations and assumptions through confronting images of masked people – some in Muslim clothing wearing chimpanzee masks, others in racially vilifying t-shirts and balaclavas decorated with the Australian flag. In both, Abdullah dissects the idea of the faceless mob who defend or disrupt the idea of the Australian nation on the basis of their own biases and prejudices.This portrait of a contemplative man skirts the stereotype by going straight to the individual and the personal – a man who may or may not be Muslim, may or may not be Australian. But, as Caliban, he represents someone who is ostracised and diminished; expressing the experience of many young Muslim Australian men, whose transition into adulthood was coloured by their exclusion from the Australian mainstream.

Abdul Abdullah,"The face of Sycorax looms out of the darkness, scrutinising the viewer with an expression that is wary and untrusting. Unlike his other images of masked, menacing and brooding faces, Abdul Abdullah’s portrait suggests a tension between openness and vulnerability, in which the gaze must be returned in equal measure – either accepting or rejecting the individual before us.The title Sycorax refers to the background character in Shakespeare’s play The Tempest, who is the mother of the half-human beast Caliban. Sycorax, already dead when the play’s action begins, is only ever spoken of by others and so exists as the projection of other characters’ memories and assumptions. As such, she functions in a manner not dissimilar to stereotypes of Muslim women in today’s media – effectively silent, and spoken of by others, rather than speaking for herself. In the play Sycorax was herself an Algerian woman, exiled to a distant island, and is thought by some academics to represent anxieties around Islamic influence during Shakespeare’s time. She is characterised in the play as a witch and sorceress – a purveyor of black magic whose claim to the island is countered by the white magic of the European interloper, Prospero. As in media portrayals of Muslim women, Prospero demonises Sycorax as deviant, projecting onto her his own prejudices and anxieties. Abdullah’s portrait articulates his experience of growing up Muslim in the suburbs of Perth in a post-September 11 world, in which he went from feeling part of mainstream Australia to being excluded as one of the ‘bad guys’. Deeply affected by the politicisation of his identity through newsprint, radio and television stereotypes, Abdullah has challenged the bias, bigotry and prejudice which has become a feature of national discourse over the past 13 years. His work is a statement of his identity as both a Muslim and a seventh-generation Australian, and an invitation to people to reconsider their assumptions and expectations of what being Muslim and Australian might be.",Sycorax,"['muslim.n.01', 'play.n.01', 'bias.n.01', 'woman.n.01', 'stereotype.n.01', 'premise.n.01', 'muslim.n.01 australian.a.01', 'magic.n.01', 'shakespeare.n.01', 'portrayal.n.01', 'medium.n.01', 'fictional_character.n.01', 'island.n.01', 'identity.n.01', 'australian.a.01', 'tension.n.01', 'storm.n.02', 'statement.n.01', 'shakespeare.n.01 play.v.01', 'play.v.01 storm.n.02', 'play.v.01', 'mother.n.01', 'guy.n.01', 'gaze.n.01', 'fictional_character.n.01 shakespeare.n.01']","['identity', 'muslim women', 'stereotype', 'mass media', 'anxiety', 'prejudice']","['Identity', 'Inequality', 'Violence']","['Inequality', 'Identity', 'Violence']","['Identity', 'Inequality', 'Violence']","['Identity', 'Activism', 'Culture']",['Identity'],"['Identity/5.567210567210568', 'Inequality/3.8161764705882355', 'Mind/2.3956043956043955']","['Identity', 'Inequality', 'Mind']",11.778991433403199,"['Fantasy/10.128371954842542', 'Mind/7.289722042663219', 'Media/6.9157239819004515']","['Fantasy', 'Mind', 'Media']",24.333817979406213,0.3333333333333333
Vernon Ah Kee,"In fantasies of the good Vernon Ah Kee portrays his family members in 13 charcoal drawings that reference and critique the depiction of Aboriginal people in Australia. These are the first serious portraits undertaken by Ah Kee, whose practice embraces text-based video works and installations. Fantasies of the good originated in Ah Kee’s discovery of photographic portraits of his great-grandfather (George Sibley) and grandfather (Mick Miller) in the collection of the State Library of Queensland. The photographs were taken on the Palm Island Mission in 1938 by Norman Tindale, an anthropologist who documented Aboriginal people all over Australia between 1921 and 1957. While a valuable record of the connection of Aboriginal people to specific lands, Tindale’s photographs also infer an underlying racism in their use of identity numbers rather than names, and their close-cropped mugshot-style format. Ah Kee reclaims these scientific, historic and public photographs of his forebears by hand-drawing them on a large scale and exhibiting them with contemporary portraits of other family members also drawn from photographs. Ah Kee’s meticulous and realistic style retains the objectivity of photography but enables him to emphasise the emotional intensity of his subjects’ piercing gazes. His reclamation of the original photographs also restores them to a family history, rather than a public one, by placing them amongst their kin. The facial resemblances in these compelling portraits suggest an ongoing familial connection, reaffirming the artist’s place within the group and anchoring his position in the world. The portraits of uncles, cousins, brothers and sons are a visual record of the solidarity, continuity and endurance of a single family and, by extension, of Aboriginal culture.",Fantasies of the Good,"['family.n.01', 'photograph.n.01', 'record.n.01', 'public.a.01', 'people.n.01 australia.n.01', 'fantasy.n.01', 'portrayal.n.01', 'connection.n.01', 'aboriginal.a.01 people.n.01', 'aboriginal.a.01', 'people.n.01', 'australia.n.01', 'specific.a.01', 'son.n.01', 'scale.n.01', 'photography.n.01', 'photographic.a.01', 'original.s.01 photograph.n.01', 'ongoing.s.01', 'historic.s.01', 'george.n.01', 'gaze.n.01', 'format.n.01', 'extension.n.01 aboriginal.a.01', 'endurance.n.01']","['family', 'endurance', 'representation', 'aboriginal australia', 'identity', 'indigeneity']","['Familial', 'Identity', 'History']","['Familial', 'Identity', 'History']","['Community', 'Identity', 'History']",,[],"['Mind/4.9282051282051285', 'Identity/4.797979797979798', 'Culture/3.269230769230769']","['Mind', 'Identity', 'Culture']",12.995415695415694,"['Arts/7.648742047426258', 'Land/6.949019607843137', 'Urbanization/4.779084967320261']","['Arts', 'Land', 'Urbanization']",19.376846622589657,0.0
Tony Albert,"The ten photographs in Tony Albert’s work Optimism show a young man wearing a jawun – a traditional woven basket unique to the North Queensland rainforest – on his back. The jawun was made by Albert’s aunt and senior weaver Ninney Murray. The man, the artist’s cousin Ethan Rist, is pictured in a variety of locations – at the football, in a supermarket, at a pool – carrying his jawun in the traditional manner: on the head and hanging down along the back. In each image the jawun is filled with objects from the artist’s daily life: a football and team scarf for the stadium; groceries from the shops; and a towel, flippers and sunblock for the pool. The jawun is a basket specific to Albert’s family’s country around Cardwell in northern Queensland. Albert’s aunt showed him the distinctive basket when he was 12 years old and explained that it had many practical and ceremonial uses. Albert photographed his cousin wearing his aunt’s basket at places Albert frequents daily. By toting it around the urban environment of Brisbane, Albert claims it as a part of everyday life rather than confining it to the realm of traditional culture. As such, he makes a claim for the integration of traditional and urban culture and the continued relevance of Indigenous cultural practices to contemporary life. Through these photographs Albert shares his own stories and that of his family, simultaneously portraying the urban lifestyle in which he grew up and acknowledging his cultural identity.

Khadim Ali,"The Haunted Lotus is a four-panel work that references the destruction of the sixth-century Bamiyan Buddha statues by the Taliban in 2001. In this work a stone Buddha reclines across the length of the four separate images and is covered by scaffolding – echoing the bamboo framework erected by UNESCO after the statues were destroyed – and surrounded by a horde of red devils with angelic white wings. The horizontal position of the Buddha evokes the legend of the 300-metre sleeping Buddha buried beneath Bamiyan Valley. Inscribed across the surface of The Haunted Lotus are excerpts from the tenth-century epic poem Shahnama (The Book of Kings) by Hakim Abol-Qasem Ferdowsi Tusi, alongside other literary and historic texts. The Persian poem has personal significance for Khadim Ali – his grandfather was a traditional singer of the Shahnama and Ali first encountered miniature painting through an illustrated version of the publication.The winged devils in The Haunted Lotus are a potent symbol and appear throughout the artist’s practice. Alluding to both good and evil, these ambiguous figures draw on the figure of Rustam, the heroic warrior of the Shahnama stories. The secular poem is known throughout Iran and Afghanistan, but in recent times the heroic figure of Rustam has been appropriated by Taliban youth who Ali heard declaring in the streets of Quetta: ‘We are the new Rustam! We are the Rustam of Islam!’ Even more shocking for Ali was meeting a young boy in Bamiyan, Afghanistan named Rustam who was unaware of the historic and mythic origin of his name, believing it to be only connected to the Taliban cause. Ali reappropriates and restores the iconic Rustam to his poetic context, updating his epic narrative to reflect contemporary political and cultural issues and the shifting nature of heroism in a war-torn region.",The Haunted Lotus,"['ali.n.01', 'buddha.n.01', 'taliban.n.01', 'poem.n.01', 'lotus.n.01', 'epic_poem.n.01', 'statue.n.01', 'satan.n.01', 'historic.s.01', 'figure.n.01', 'warrior.n.01', 'valley.n.01', 'surface.n.01', 'singer.n.01', 'significance.n.01', 'rock.n.01', 'reflect.v.01', 'red.s.01', 'potent.s.01', 'political.a.01 cultural.a.01', 'poetic.a.01', 'king.n.01', 'iconic.a.01', 'heroic_verse.n.01', 'text.n.01']","['identity', 'afhganistan', 'buddha', 'taliban', 'mythology', 'history']","['History', 'Identity', 'War']","['Spirituality', 'Culture', 'Violence']","['Identity', 'Inequality', 'Spirituality']","['Culture', 'Identity', 'History']",[],"['Identity/4.797979797979798', 'Time/1.709090909090909', 'History/1.0']","['Identity', 'Time', 'History']",7.507070707070707,"['Arts/8.661361170649096', 'Space/6.346153846153846', 'Fantasy/3.257142857142857']","['Arts', 'Space', 'Fantasy']",18.264657873945797,0.0
Peter Alwast,"Peter Alwast explores the relationship between the real and the virtual through a range of media, including installation, drawing, painting, video and computer graphics. The Night Sky continues his fascination with urban development and the construction of controlled spaces, such as gated communities. The video depicts a new suburban development at night. It is a cityscape devoid of people, with houses that are illuminated but appear empty, as if awaiting their occupants. Above the estate, neon texts float slowly through the air, blinking on and off, lighting up the empty streets. Referencing the language of self-help manuals, the disembodied statements are based on conversations overheard by the artist and explore particular relationships or (dis-)connections with society: ‘I am fat and alone’, or ‘A good dancer is one that shows his own virtuosity as well as dancing with others’.The landscape in The Night Sky offers no warmth or personality – it is a nothing place, like a new estate or gated community. Alwast re-creates the façade of this constructed environment using animation tools that are reminiscent of a real estate industry promotional video. The babbling brook and the click of cicadas is a soundtrack rather than an integral part of the scene. It is a perfect suburban world that is isolating and suffocating. High above the pristine roofs and clean-cut gardens the hopes and dreams of the new inhabitants are broadcast unnoticed and unfulfilled. The prefabricated town of The Night Sky is a constructed and commodified space in which nature itself seems transplanted. Alwast’s work is no celebration of this existence, rather it draws attention to the bleak interior of the new Australian dream.",The Night Sky,"['night.n.01', 'estate.n.01', 'night.n.01 sky.n.01', 'sky.n.01', 'dream.n.01', 'development.n.01', 'community.n.01', 'real.a.01', 'video.n.01', 'space.n.01', 'relationship.n.01', 'statement.n.01', 'scope.n.01', 'roof.n.01', 'research.v.02 relationship.n.01', 'peter.n.01', 'perfect.a.01', 'neon.n.01', 'house.n.01', 'hope.n.01', 'evocative.s.01', 'discorporate.s.01', 'conversation.n.01', 'connection.n.01', 'celebration.n.01']","['virtual reality', 'suburbia', 'self-help', 'facade', 'environment', 'urban development']","['Urbanization', 'Emotion', 'Fantasy']","['Urbanization', 'Culture', 'Fantasy']","['Urbanization', 'Fantasy', 'Community']","['Urbanization', 'Materiality', 'Environmental']",['Urbanization'],"['Familial/2.723076923076923', 'Land/1.7142857142857142', 'Urbanization/1.657142857142857']","['Familial', 'Land', 'Urbanization']",6.094505494505494,"['Language/4.67948717948718', 'Time/4.1568627450980395', 'Familial/4.018099547511312']","['Language', 'Time', 'Familial']",12.854449472096531,0.3333333333333333
Brook Andrew,"Brook Andrew’s Loop. A Model of how the world operates is part of an ongoing series of wall drawings using black-and-white patterns traditionally carved into shields and trees (dendroglyphs) inspired by his matriarchal Wiradjuri cultural heritage of western New South Wales. In Loop Andrew has overlaid these monochromatic diagonals with slowly throbbing spirals of neon, interspersing traditional memory in order to challenge our relationship to the inheritance of tradition in a society built on activities of trying to forget Aboriginal culture. The oversized diamond patterns create a dazzling optical effect, similar to that seen in 1960s op art. Andrew uses this dazzle, alongside the glowing neon, as a metaphor for our contemporary culture of consumption and spectacle, in which we are mesmerised by consumerism and drawn in by advertising as ways to forget cultural and historical responsibilities. What appears to be an abstract, hard-edge minimalist work is grounded in traditional life and culture; the neon coils, glowing on and off, aim, as Andrew says, ‘to hypnotise. The overall effect: Free will or submission?’ The work is a wall drawing, which is as much an idea as it is an object. It is re-created each time it is shown, and so it responds to the size and condition of its environment, whether inside a museum or outside, with the patterns expanding or contracting in scale to cover the wall. What persists is the push and pull between traditional ways and contemporary culture, looped together in an interaction that Andrew considers to be a model of how the world operates.",Loop.

Split Fountain was shown at the 2009 exhibition Uncanny Valley at Roslyn Oxley9 Gallery, Sydney. The title of the exhibition comes from a term coined in the 1970s to describe our antipathy towards things that look almost, but not quite, human: the ‘valley’ is the steep dip in empathy we experience when confronted by a robot or a 3D computer animation of a person that is not wholly convincing.

Split Fountain was one of several sculptures of sphinxes in this exhibition, where the structure of the sphinx serves as a model to explore the dislocation of head and body, object and plinth, both physically and conceptually.

Benjamin Armstrong,"The misshapen waxen eyes in the glass cones of Old Friends are both comical and unnerving. Forlorn and deflated in their specimen jars, they appear to have popped out of a cartoon character’s head and preserved in glass for future study. Benjamin Armstrong has distorted the perfect sphere of the eyeball into unnervingly malleable shapes, sucked into the hand-blown glass cones like boiled eggs into bottles. The enucleated eye – the eye wholly removed from its socket – is a powerful metaphor in western literature. Sophocles and Shakespeare coupled the violence of torn-out eyes to the insight gained from freedom from worldly illusions in Oedipus Rex and King Lear, while Georges Bataille’s Story of the Eye invokes a set of psycho-sexual associations between eyes, testicles, breasts and eggs. Old Friends alludes to the power of this metaphor in its display of the disembodied eye, detached from its function of reading and looking.

Armstrong’s organic and handmade materials couple the transparency and fragility of glass with the opacity and malleability of wax. They create a sensual impression of natural forms, made strange through distortion and a kind of alienation. The irregular deviations from conical perfection in the hand-blown glass cones give an impression of animated organic forms, like the probing antennae of a slug or the shoot of a tuber reaching towards light. Indeed, light, sight and vision are at the heart of Old Friends. The refractive properties of glass, polished into lenses, extends vision through spectacles, telescopes and microscopes, enabling glimpses of other worlds unavailable to the naked eye. In Old Friends, we see the naked eye, extruded and contained within the glass; behaving as a disembodied vision, seeing that which sees.",Old Friends,"['glass.n.01', 'eye.n.01', 'glass.n.01 cone.n.01', 'eyes.n.01', 'friend.n.01', 'cone.n.01', 'vision.n.01', 'oedipus.n.01', 'egg.n.02', 'organic.a.01', 'king.n.01', 'discorporate.s.01', 'metaphor.n.01', 'light.n.01', 'form.n.01', 'sphere.n.01', 'reading.n.01', 'perfect.a.01', 'george.n.01', 'future.a.01', 'falsify.v.01', 'ductile.s.01', 'deformed.s.01', 'conic.a.01', 'shakespeare.n.01']","['body', 'symbolism', 'disembodied', 'antropomorphic', 'vision', 'eyes']","['Body', 'Materiality', 'Fantasy']","['Body', 'Materiality', 'Violence']","['Culture', 'Fantasy', 'Body']","['Body', 'Space', 'Physics']",['Body'],"['Space/6.346153846153846', 'Mind/2.488888888888889', 'Spirituality/1.6']","['Space', 'Mind', 'Spirituality']",10.435042735042733,"['Mind/4.844444444444444', 'Spirituality/2.442105263157895', 'Arts/2.371794871794872']","['Mind', 'Spirituality', 'Arts']",9.65834457939721,0.6666666666666666
Barbara Cleveland,"In The One Hour Laugh, Barbara Cleveland (formerly Brown Council) – a Sydney-based collaboration of four artists – stand before a video camera and laugh continuously for one hour. Over the course of the hour their laughter moves from genuine hilarity to embarrassment, strain and boredom, becoming forced and faked. The work is part of a practice of live-art performances and collaborations and draws on ideas about spectacle and physical endurance to investigate what it is to perform, and how live performances are documented.

Dressed in homemade costumes, their dunces hats, paper bibs and fake eyebrows enhance the absurdity of their performance, recalling the anarchic theatrics of the Cabaret Voltaire in Zurich in 1916 and the subversive comedy of Groucho Marx. Forcing themselves to laugh for the entire tedium of an hour creates an element of excruciation that situates the work within the lineage of performance art and acts of endurance like those of Marina Abramovic and Ulay in the 1970s and 1980s.

John Barbour,"Inherent Vice is a delicate hand-stitched and painted wall banner made from loosely sewn panels of voile, on which the words ‘inherent vice’ have been placed in a circular mandala over Rorschach-style ink blots. Pinned to the wall, this idiosyncratic banner sits at the intersection of painting and a tactile, three-dimensional piece. It is a deliberately fragile work, its title referring to the art conservation term ‘inherent vice’ – that is, the response of materials to the effects of light, handling and atmospheric conditions. Here is how the artist, John Barbour, expressed his understanding of the term: “A sculpture made of steel, bronze or stone presumably has a low index of inherent vice. An oil painting might have a medium index. Artworks made of fabric or paper, in being particularly fragile, have a high index. A human being, as a work of art, presumably also has a high index of inherent vice”.1

For Barbour, human beings, like his wall banner, are in a constant state of physical decay, heading towards an eventual disintegration that signals the end of a ‘lifetime’ – however long that may be. Barbour has woven his reflections on the transience of life and mortality into Inherent Vice through his use of non-lightfast inks, delicate fabric and loose and unstable needlework. These materials increase the work’s inherent vice index and reflect his longstanding interest in what he calls ‘unmaking’ – an acknowledgement of human frailty and a deliberate resistance to the well made.

Barbour pursued a gently ironic artistic practice, exploring the paradox between form and formlessness in a manner which has been referred to as a kind of “studied incompetence”.2 His materials of choice are modest: fabric, thread, cardboard, found objects and ink. With these he created banners like Inherent Vice and various kinds of wall and floor installations over his 30-year career.",Inherent Vice,"['frailty.n.02', 'built-in.s.01 frailty.n.02', 'built-in.s.01', 'banner.n.01', 'ink.n.01', 'wall.n.01', 'human.a.01', 'fabric.n.01', 'delicate.a.01', 'material.n.01', 'term.n.01', 'weave.v.01', 'round.a.01', 'rock.n.01', 'response.n.01', 'reflect.v.01', 'recognition.n.01', 'panel.n.01', 'effects.n.01', 'conditions.n.01', 'piece.n.01', 'physical.a.01', 'paper.n.01', 'floor.n.01']","['fragility', 'ephemeral', 'decay', 'delicate', 'disintegration', 'transcience']","['Body', 'Time', 'Materiality']","['Time', 'Body', 'Immaterial']","['Physics', 'Time', 'Body']","['Time', 'Materiality', 'Body']","['Body', 'Time']","['Immaterial/1.0', 'War/0.8695652173913043', 'Environmental/0.7777777777777778']","['Immaterial', 'War', 'Environmental']",2.647342995169082,"['Space/6.346153846153846', 'Environmental/3.3494505494505495', 'Arts/3.3076923076923075']","['Space', 'Environmental', 'Arts']",13.003296703296702,0.3333333333333333
Richard Bell,"Worth Exploring? features two documents that use European legal language and logic against itself: a statutory declaration challenging the legitimacy and legality of European colonisation, and a certificate of authenticity, a common document used in the Aboriginal art market that Bell connects to forms of racial classification. These texts flank two paintings, each with their own conflicted relation to Aboriginal art. The large painted ‘E’ sets up a dialogue with two other paintings: the monumental letters ‘I AM’ of Colin McCahon’s Victory Over Death (1970) and the ‘E’ shapes used by Michael Jagamara Nelson in his paintings to indicate possum tracks. Nelson’s work was controversially appropriated by Imants Tillers in 1985. In 2001 the two artists collaborated on the work Nature Speaks: Y (Possum Dreaming) that features the ‘E’ shapes, and which Bell has here appropriated again. The second painting in Worth Exploring? is an abstract expressionist work in the style of Jackson Pollock. It refers to Bell’s demand that if Aboriginal art is to be incorporated into a western art aesthetic, it should be “seen for what it is – as being amongst the world’s best examples of abstract expressionism”.1

In Worth Exploring? Bell criticises the appropriation of Aboriginal art by non-Aboriginal artists and its domination by white curators, critics, academics, dealers and collectors. Combining political bite and caustic humour, Bell argues for greater Aboriginal control over Aboriginal art and, by extension, over Aboriginal culture within Australian society.",Worth Exploring,"['bell.n.01', 'aborigine.n.02', 'pollock.n.01', 'opossum.n.02', 'nelson.n.01', 'document.n.01', 'european.a.01', 'abstract.a.01', 'shape.n.01', 'artist.n.01', 'allow.v.04', 'feature.n.01', 'extension.n.01 aboriginal.a.01', 'common.a.01', 'colonization.n.01', 'text.n.01', 'relation.n.01', 'extension.n.01', 'aboriginal.a.01 culture.n.01', 'western.a.01', 'temper.n.02', 'society.n.01', 'political.a.01', 'nature.n.01', 'aboriginal.a.01']","['appropriation', 'humour', 'westerncentrism', 'authenticity', 'equality', 'aboriginal']","['Culture', 'Arts', 'Colonization']","['Colonization', 'Politics', 'History']","['Colonization', 'Inequality', 'Power']","['Culture', 'Politics', 'Land']",[],"['Emotion/11.35780885780886', 'Violence/2.371794871794872', 'Economy/0.9333333333333333']","['Emotion', 'Violence', 'Economy']",14.662937062937067,"['Emotion/11.35780885780886', 'Language/5.164835164835164', 'Technology/3.980392156862745']","['Emotion', 'Language', 'Technology']",20.50303617950677,0.3333333333333333
Gordon Bennett,"Home Decor (Relative/Absolute) Flowers for Mathinna #2 is, as Gordon Bennett describes it, “at once one painting and many paintings”.1 It combines references to 11 other paintings, each relating in some way to Bennett’s principal concern with the representation of Aboriginal people. The work is dominated by the portrait of Mathinna, a Tasmanian Aboriginal girl who was painted by the colonial artist Thomas Bock in 1842. Her story is key to this work. At seven years of age, she was taken from her parents and adopted by the then Governor of Tasmania, Sir John Franklin, in 1842. She was abandoned a year later when the Franklins returned to England. Mathinna eventually went back to her people at Flinders Island and later moved to Oyster Bay, dying from complications relating to alcoholism in 1856.2

This sorry tale of theft and cultural dislocation resounds through the other works Bennett quotes in this painting, especially the Margaret Preston woodcut of desert peas that sits below the portrait of Mathinna. These are the ‘flowers for Mathinna’ in the work’s title, and they function as another reminder of the ways in which white Australia has adopted ‘Aboriginality’ without the permission of, or regard for, Aboriginal people themselves. Preston freely borrowed Aboriginal themes and motifs in her artworks, using them to establish a visual language that she believed to be distinctly Australian and which she hoped would become a defining national style.

Here, Preston’s work is appropriated by an Indigenous artist who, in an act of commemoration, offers an image back to another image – that of Mathinna – from the past. Preston’s appropriative strategy is mirrored in the other images Bennett quotes, ranging from the dot paintings of Papunya Tula, and the Ben-Day printing dots of pop art, to his own reworkings of colonial representations of Aboriginal people. This kind of borrowing from the past is both a revision and reinterpretation, and its interweaving of motif and meaning brings back into focus the images and histories that continue to shape us.",Home Decor,"['bennett.n.01', 'aboriginal.a.01 people.n.01', 'representation.n.01 aboriginal.a.01', 'representation.n.01', 'flower.n.01', 'colonial.a.01', 'motif.n.01', 'franklin.n.01', 'aboriginal.a.01', 'people.n.01', 'aborigine.n.02', 'image.n.01', 'portrayal.n.01', 'narrative.n.01', 'subject.n.01', 'reminder.n.01', 'point.n.09', 'parent.n.01', 'governor.n.01', 'girl.n.01', 'focus.n.01', 'establish.v.01', 'dislocation.n.01', 'concern.n.01', 'commemoration.n.01']","['identity', 'representation', 'racism', 'history', 'aboriginality', 'colonialism']","['Identity', 'Inequality', 'History']","['Colonization', 'Identity', 'History']","['Arts', 'History', 'Identity']","['Culture', 'Colonization', 'History']",['History'],"['Inequality/5.304044424787459', 'Mind/4.9282051282051285', 'Identity/4.797979797979798']","['Inequality', 'Mind', 'Identity']",15.030229350972386,"['Mind/12.252014652014653', 'Culture/8.846153846153847', 'Fantasy/6.023376623376624']","['Mind', 'Culture', 'Fantasy']",27.12154512154512,0.3333333333333333
Stephen Birch,"Stephen Birch’s installation Untitled depicts an unusual confrontation between a life-size model of the superhero Spiderman and a worm-like, bearded figure whose atrophied head sits atop an arm-like neck protruding from the gallery wall. It suggests a type of mirroring or inversion, in which a full-bodied superhero – whose potency is exaggerated by his bulging crotch – balances and reflects the portrait of his ‘defective’ and repulsive opposite.

Birch’s Spiderman is a misshapen figure: the costume and role that he now inhabits barely accommodates his imperfections. The encounter between superhero and the aged, bearded mortal raises questions about the similarities between the two – they are constructed opposites inhabiting the same fictional world. In this installation the tension between the superhero and his nemesis is made palpable.

Daniel Boyd,"Daniel Boyd’s painting We Call Them Pirates Out Here mocks the official history of white exploration and settlement by suggesting that one person’s explorer is another person’s pirate. This work is a parody of a famous 1902 history painting by Emanuel Phillip Fox depicting the 1770 landing of Captain Cook at Botany Bay. Depicted as a marauding pirate, Boyd’s Cook claims possession of the land with his skull-and-crossbones Union Jack. No longer the heroic and civilised explorer of Fox’s painting, Cook becomes the anti-hero of an opposing narrative in which his landing is reframed as a moment of invasion and pillage for the original inhabitants.

This kind of reworking of significant historical works is a potent artistic tool for commentary on Australia’s history, past and present. In other works, such as Governor No Beard (2007), Boyd has presented a buccaneering narrative of Australian history in which Australia is a Treasure Island and Cook, the Enlightenment man, little more than a treasure hunter. In We Call Them Pirates Out Here Boyd has appropriated a powerful piece of propaganda. Fox’s history painting, commissioned soon after the federation of Australia, depicts Cook – and by extension, the nation – as an enlightened humanist who prevents his men from firing on two advancing Aboriginal warriors. In Boyd’s update, the warriors are replaced by two Xanthorrhoea grass trees, called ‘black boys’ by the colonists. Cook’s heroic gesture is thus emptied of meaning and we see the scene as an opportunistic land grab founded on the one-eyed myth that the country was uninhabited.",We call them pirates out here,"['cook.n.01', 'fox.n.01', 'plagiarist.n.01', 'explorer.n.01', 'warrior.n.01', 'heroic_verse.n.01', 'history.n.01', 'land.n.01', 'state.n.04', 'australia.n.01', 'narrative.n.01', 'person.n.01', 'replace.v.01', 'potent.s.01', 'parody.n.01', 'governor.n.01', 'gesture.n.01', 'exploration.n.01', 'establish.v.01', 'daniel.n.01', 'colony.n.01', 'tree.n.01', 'tool.n.01', 'powerful.a.01', 'piece.n.01']","['coloniality', 'political commentary', 'appropritaton', 'history', 'reinterpretation', 'parody', 'anti-hero']","['Identity', 'History', 'Politics']","['Colonization', 'History', 'Land']","['Colonization', 'History', 'Arts']","['History', 'Colonization', 'Power']",['History'],"['Time/2.5090909090909093', 'History/1.0', 'Media/0.8571428571428571']","['Time', 'History', 'Media']",4.3662337662337665,"['Land/9.054758313581843', 'Power/3.266666666666667', 'Urbanization/3.1790849673202617']","['Land', 'Power', 'Urbanization']",15.500509947568773,0.0
Rebecca Baumann,"Automated Colour Field is a kinetic sculpture consisting of a wall-mounted grid of 100 flip-clocks, the numbered panels of which have been replaced by paper cards in a variety of colours. The battery-operated clocks keep their own time, turning the paper cards on the minute and the hour to create a kaleidoscopic field of colour. As in many of Baumann’s works, the mechanisms used to activate her chosen materials, and the incidental noises these mechanisms generate, are an important element of the experience she creates. In this work the analogue clocks activate the paper cards, producing a low background hum and soft pattering sound like raindrops falling on a tin roof.

Informed by psychology, colour theory and art history, Automated Colour Field makes reference to the abstract painting movement known as colour field. Links can also be made to German artist Gerhard Richter’s colour chart paintings of the 1960s and 1970s, which mimic the charts used by paint manufacturers and incorporate chance distributions of colour. Like Richter, Baumann uses processes of chance and a commercially available colour palette in her work, describing her placement of the coloured cards as being driven by a spontaneous rather than pre-planned impulse, resulting in an arbitrary arrangement of colour.

Baumann is interested in how we subjectively perceive colour and time, and how these phenomena are scientifically visualised and measured. Her main focus is the intimate relationship between colour and emotion, and the way specific colours and colour combinations can elicit particular feelings or moods. Bringing time into this equation, Baumann links the continually changing arrangements of colour generated by the flip-clocks to the fluctuating spectrum of emotions people experience over any 24-hour period.",Automated Colour Field,"['coloring_material.n.01', 'field.n.01', 'card_game.n.01', 'paper.n.01 card_game.n.01', 'paper.n.01', 'redstem_storksbill.n.01', 'opportunity.n.01', 'emotion.n.01', 'colors.n.02', 'coloring_material.n.01 field.n.01', 'color.a.01', 'time.n.01', 'specific.a.01', 'roof.n.01', 'replace.v.01', 'panel.n.01', 'paint.n.01', 'hour.n.01', 'focus.n.01', 'coloring_material.n.01 palette.n.01', 'chief.s.01', 'busyness.n.01', 'time_period.n.01', 'palette.n.01', 'component.n.01']","['time', 'kinetic', 'colourfield', 'everyday', 'perception', 'clocks']","['Time', 'Design', 'Body']","['Arts', 'Fantasy', 'Mind']","['Time', 'Arts', 'Emotion']","['Time', 'Arts', 'Design']",[],"['Time/2.6263736263736264', 'Mind/2.3956043956043955', 'Culture/2.307692307692308']","['Time', 'Mind', 'Culture']",7.32967032967033,"['Emotion/14.500299700299703', 'Environmental/5.085714285714285', 'Spirituality/4.116849816849817']","['Emotion', 'Environmental', 'Spirituality']",23.702863802863806,0.0
Pat Brassington,"The four photo-media works from Pat Brassington’s series You’re so Vein (2005) are at once enticing and unsettling. Body parts are photographed from odd angles, distorted, cropped and foreshortened. In one image a mouth is sliced by the edge of the frame, in another a foot is scaly and inhuman, while legs are splayed or oddly elongated. In none of these works is there a whole body nor a full face, instead the viewer is left to interpret a situation or psychological state through segments of the body that stand in for the whole, as in a fetish. The colour palette in these works is predominantly pale pink and off-white and the emphasis in the images falls on mouth, crotch or feet. As art historian Helen McDonald wrote of this series, Brassington’s pink is “impotent”, unable to “open into space, like blue” but achieving either “dull luminescence” or imploding in “a subcutaneous sherbet bomb of sensation”.1

The titles of the works are playful and open up diverse interpretations. Crush could refer to the berry red lips at the top of the image, to the claustrophobia of an embrace, or to a more sinister possibility of violence to the exposed and vulnerable neck. Topography in Pink invites a landscape metaphor to apply to the striped leggings and splayed legs. Rocket evokes the elongated machine, thrusting into beige carpet. In The Wedding Guest a reptilian or amphibian form emerges along the floor from beneath a satin hem, and the title suggests unwanted advances and psychological and bodily mess beneath fine fabric and marriage celebrations.",You're so Vein,"['pink.n.01', 'image.n.01 mouth.n.01', 'foot.n.01', 'psychological.s.01', 'body.n.01', 'series.n.01', 'title.n.01', 'image.n.01', 'spectator.n.01 leave.v.01', 'section.n.04', 'rug.n.01', 'red.s.01', 'playful.a.01', 'pale.s.01', 'odd.a.01', 'neck.n.01', 'frame.n.01', 'fork.n.03', 'falsify.v.01', 'embrace.n.01', 'divers.s.01', 'coloring_material.n.01 palette.n.01', 'celebration.n.01', 'palette.n.01', 'floor.n.01']","['disembodied', 'body', 'abject', 'ambiguety', 'fetish', 'phychological']","['Body', 'Mind', 'Fantasy']","['Body', 'Violence', 'Fantasy']","['Body', 'Emotion', 'Violence']","['Body', 'Fantasy', 'Space']",['Body'],"['Space/6.346153846153846', 'Emotion/1.6263736263736264', 'Body/1.0']","['Space', 'Emotion', 'Body']",8.972527472527473,"['Space/6.346153846153846', 'Mind/4.791208791208791', 'Culture/4.615384615384616']","['Space', 'Mind', 'Culture']",15.752747252747252,0.3333333333333333
Ian Burns,"Showtime is a kinetic assemblage constructed from plastic chairs, an electric fan, a mirror ball and a monitor. The inverted plastic chairs projecting from the wall house the sculpture’s dynamic and spectacular elements: a spinning disco ball and a monitor showing video footage of a jet plane. Their ‘jet set’ associations with glitter and glamour are at odds with the domestic mundanity of the chairs, which would be familiar to anyone who has ever browsed an Ikea catalogue. Fixed to the chairs is a heavily laden power board trailing untidy lengths of cord that snake into and out of the wall-hung work. Nothing is hidden or glossed over in this work; the mechanics of its production are laid bare, and its assembly is of a distinctly handmade and improvised nature.

The screen that fronts the work shows Air Force One – the military aircraft specially designated for the President of the United States –, in flight. However, it is not the real jet aircraft we see on the screen but a live video feed of a toy plane suspended behind the monitor. A small fan blowing against the wall creates the turbulence that moves the plane, simulating a flight above the earth that is entirely fictitious. Air Force One exists here in a closed circuit – a self-perpetuating loop in which it relentlessly broadcasts an image of itself, appearing to move while remaining stationary.

Ian Burns made this work in New York during the 2008 presidential campaign that saw Barack Obama elected. The combination of the glittering disco ball with the imagery of Air Force One suggests the global power and authority of the Office of the President and the hype and spectacle of American elections – while the plastic chairs and electrical components suggest the rather less glamorous machinations underlying them. By placing the screen centre-stage in his do-it-yourself structure, Burns manifests the centrality of screens in our lives – not just as sources of entertainment and news but also of surveillance and misinformation.",Showtime,"['chair.n.01', 'plastic.n.01 chair.n.01', 'plastic.n.01', 'jet.n.01', 'ball.n.01', 'airplane.n.01', 'air_force.n.01', 'air.n.01', 'proctor.n.01', 'put.v.01', 'president.n.01', 'fan.n.01', 'disco.n.01 ball.n.01', 'disco.n.01', 'burns.n.01', 'screen.n.01', 'flight.n.01', 'wall.n.01', 'power.n.01']","['stage', 'fiction', 'mass media', 'illusion', 'spectacle', 'misinformation']","['Mass media', 'Technology', 'Fantasy']","['Power', 'Fantasy', 'Mass media']","['Power', 'Technology', 'Mass media']","['Technology', 'Mass media', 'Materiality']",['Mass media'],"['Fantasy/6.491666666666667', 'Spirituality/2.533119658119658', 'Time/2.466666666666667']","['Fantasy', 'Spirituality', 'Time']",11.491452991452991,"['Technology/4.220588235294117', 'Arts/3.1076923076923078', 'Power/2.511655011655012']","['Technology', 'Arts', 'Power']",9.839935554641437,0.0
Ian Burn,"Ian Burn’s Systematically Altered Photographs is a suite of black-and-white images of suburban scenes, photocopied over and over until only a dotted matrix of the original image remains. The original photographs may have come from a brochure promoting the Australian lifestyle – its ordered and spacious suburbs, modern schools and natural settings. These are images of settled and colonised places that could be anywhere in Australia, and Burn further displaces them by systematically stripping them of visual information until they become more and more meaningless. They become things in which we look at, as well as look for, information. The images are accompanied by an essay written by Burn examining the relationship between what we see and how we talk of what we see, in which the semantic differences between ‘looking at’ and ‘looking for’ show the ways in which language conditions our visual experience.

The relationship between language and perception, the image and its viewer, and between art and the society in which it functions, were overriding concerns for Burn, who was an Australian artist known internationally for his leading role in the development of conceptual art. Systematically Altered Photographs was made around the time Burn joined the conceptual art collective Art & Language in New York. Departing from his earlier interest in landscapes and paintings, Burn examined the concept of art and its commodification and operation within the art market.

Jon Campbell,"In Stacks On, Jon Campbell stacks glowing lightboxes of different shapes and sizes on top of one another in an installation that captures the political and cultural milieu of the inner city though its slogans, slang and lingo. Usually the domain of advertising and brand awareness, Campbell takes lightboxes from their customary location in the street, bus shelter and milk bar and re-orients them towards a personal archive of recollections, communicating the diverse voices and cultural landscape of his upbringing through its distinctive typography, words and phrases.

Interspersed between the towering lightbox stacks are screenprinted banners hanging from the ceiling. Like the lightboxes, they declare – in a phrase or a single word – their allegiance to the memory of inner-city suburbs. The lightbox inscribed with ‘Footscray Halal meats 100%’ and the banner declaring ‘Franco Cozzo’ (a well-known Melbourne furniture retailer) refer to the multicultural character of places like Footscray and Brunswick, now an important part of their sense of place. Within this melting pot of references are words of distinctly Australian flavor, like ‘snot block’ and ‘schnitz and titz.’ These unique colloquialisms – one an unflattering description of the singular Australian delicacy, the vanilla slice (a solid block of custard held between two layers of pastry) the other shorthand for the food and service on offer at a particular kind of Australian pub ­– belong to an informal language of suburban working class masculinity.

Posters for 1970s proto-punk bands like Radio Birdman and The Saints are enlarged as vivid screenprints by Campbell and hung alongside snippets of overheard conversations – “it’s a world full of lying bastards” ­– with slogans from the proposed damming of the Franklin River in the 1980s and the suggested closure of the Victorian College of the Arts (VCA) in 2010. These stacked and floating slabs of text and slang, torn from times and places familiar to the artist, recall the voices, influences and memories experienced in the streets of urban Australia, creating a kind of unofficial history of its vernacular expression.",Stacks on,"['campbell.n.01', 'slang.n.01', 'phrase.n.01', 'voice.n.01', 'banner.n.01', 'street.n.01', 'memory.n.01', 'australian.a.01', 'cultural.a.01', 'sphere.n.01', 'solid.s.01', 'size.n.01', 'set.n.05', 'political.a.01 cultural.a.01', 'franklin.n.01', 'expression.n.01', 'divers.s.01', 'distinctive.s.01', 'description.n.01', 'conversation.n.01', 'suburb.n.01', 'sense.n.01', 'radio.n.01', 'personal.a.01', 'influence.n.01']","['colloquialism', 'slang', 'vernacular', 'australia', 'text', 'advertising']","['Language', 'Identity', 'Culture']","['Identity', 'Community', 'Culture']","['Mass media', 'Culture', 'Urbanization']","['Language', 'Culture', 'Materiality']",['Culture'],"['Language/10.833333333333334', 'Land/3.5712418300653597', 'Urbanization/3.1790849673202617']","['Language', 'Land', 'Urbanization']",17.583660130718954,"['Language/7.417582417582417', 'Media/3.646606334841629', 'Culture/3.3076923076923075']","['Language', 'Media', 'Culture']",14.371881060116355,0.3333333333333333
Christian Capurro,"Another Misspent Portrait of Etienne de Silhouette comprises a Vogue Hommes magazine completely erased by hand, affiliated works and a series of interrelated, often site-specific programs that use the core project pieces as the basis for an exploration of understandings of value, exchange, expenditure, picturing and effacement.

The work was produced over a five-year period between 1999 and 2004 by more than 260 volunteers who participated by erasing and then inscribing a page with the time it took them to erase it and how much they then earned for their time. Since 2004, and with each new presentation of the magazine, various material works are produced and contributions enacted ‘in its shadow’.

The title of the work references the eighteenth-century French finance minister Étienne de Silhouette, who was famous for his severe budget-cutting during the Seven Years’ War of 1759. At the time, featureless portraits cut from black card were the cheapest method available of recording a person’s appearance before the advent of photography.

Daniel Crooks,"In Static No.12 (seek stillness in movement), Daniel Crooks transports viewers to a park in Shanghai where an old man performs his daily Tai Chi routine. The man’s graceful movements begin to fragment and multiply, becoming distended and mutated within the frame. Crooks’ image draws viewers into a sensual, slow-moving relationship with the man’s gestures, which seem molten and malleable, submerged in elastic time. Watching Static No.12 (seek stillness in movement) can create the feeling of entering a new dimension where the rules of time and space have changed. The densely layered drones and hums of the video’s soundtrack rise and fall in relation to the image.

Crooks is best known for his digital video and photographic works that capture and manipulate time and motion. The artist coined the term ‘time-slice’ to describe the series of works he has been developing since 1999, which includes Static No.12 (seek stillness in movement). To create the time-slice works, Crooks uses multiple cameras and a special digital editing technique, whereby small segments of moving images are selected, warped and recombined across the screen. The resulting imagery is fluid and undulating, a non-linear and multi-perspective view of movement and time.

Featuring seemingly banal environments, such as streetscapes, parks, elevators and commuter trains in his videos and photographs, Crooks transforms the everyday and takes us on a mesmerising journey into the time-space continuum. The works are visually reminiscent of the nineteenth-century photographic experiments by Etienne-Jules Marey, and the paintings by the Italian futurist Giacomo Balla. Crooks’ time-slice works capture an exquisitely detailed yet altered vision of reality, one that probes and unsettles the way we perceive and understand the world.",Static No. 12,"['criminal.n.01', 'hush.n.01 motion.n.03', 'hush.n.01', 'motion.n.03', 'change.v.01', 'photographic.a.01', 'inactive.s.10', 'digital.a.01', 'time.n.01', 'viewing_audience.n.01', 'make.v.03', 'video.n.01', 'image.n.01', 'technique.n.01', 'section.n.04', 'position.n.03', 'graceful.a.01', 'gesture.n.02', 'gesture.n.01', 'futurist.n.01', 'frame.n.01', 'evocative.s.01', 'ductile.s.01', 'digital.a.01 editing.n.01', 'daniel.n.01']","['time', 'movement', 'distortion', 'elasticity', 'fluidity', 'continuum']","['Time', 'Physics', 'Culture']","['Body', 'Time', 'Identity']","['Community', 'Physics', 'Time']","['Time', 'Space', 'Technology']",['Time'],"['Time/5.848595848595849', 'Geopolitics/3.2026143790849675', 'Physics/2.435897435897436']","['Time', 'Geopolitics', 'Physics']",11.487107663578252,"['Geopolitics/4.758169934640523', 'Politics/4.023529411764706', 'Time/3.4347069597069595']","['Geopolitics', 'Politics', 'Time']",12.216406306112189,0.6666666666666666
Juan Davila,"Juan Davila’s Sentimental History of Australian Art was exhibited in the 1983 Sydney Perspecta, and became almost at once an iconic work of Australian postmodernism. Its appropriation of a number of cultural references presents a history of Australian art that is as much provocative as it is sentimental. Davila constructs a model of Australian masculinity that combines the body of an Aboriginal man with the head of the white colonial renegade Ned Kelly, in the style of the homoerotic illustrations of Tom of Finland. His postmodern pastiche of styles and cultural markers also borrows from Australian artists such as Arthur Boyd and neo-expressionist Peter Booth, and the American pop artist Roy Lichtenstein. These ‘high art’ references are staged against the kitsch of everyday Australia, represented in the shower-curtain’s pseudo-Aboriginal design of boomerangs, strung between the broken columns of a cobwebbed temple of culture.

Davila combines these cultural markers with sexual imagery, scatological humour, caricature and a range of graphic styles to explore art’s relationship to history, culture, politics and identity in his work. He draws parallels between Latin American and Australian modernism, based on their shared experiences of colonisation and cultures transplanted from Britain and Spain. Davila’s challenging juxtapositions of imagery in Sentimental History of Australian Art draw on surrealism and its distinctly Latin American form of magical realism, employing the images and impulses of dreams and the unconscious mind to express desires and libidinal urges otherwise repressed by social convention. Davila uses this imagery to critique what he considered to be a lowbrow and culturally conservative Australian society of the 1980s, and to shock it out of its complacency. The complex relationship between art and politics is intertwined throughout Davila’s practice, questioning both the impact of politics on artistic and cultural life, and the role of art as an agent of social comment and change.",Sentimental History of Australian Art,"['politics.n.01', 'history.n.01 australian.a.01', 'american.a.01', 'cultural.a.01 marker.n.01', 'australian.a.01', 'imagination.n.02', 'history.n.01', 'culture.n.01', 'cultural.a.01', 'manner.n.01', 'social.a.01', 'mention.n.01', 'relationship.n.01', 'share.v.01', 'scope.n.01', 'research.v.02 relationship.n.01', 'peter.n.01', 'iconic.a.01', 'dream.n.01', 'cultural.a.01 life.n.01', 'colonization.n.01', 'review.v.02', 'research.v.02', 'represent.v.01', 'establish.v.08']","['art history', 'australia', 'hypermasculinity', 'pastiche', 'symbolism', 'postmodernity']","['Arts', 'Identity', 'Culture']","['Body', 'Emotion', 'Identity']","['Arts', 'Fantasy', 'Culture']","['Body', 'Culture', 'Politics']",[],"['Land/3.5712418300653597', 'Urbanization/3.1790849673202617', 'Arts/0.8333333333333334']","['Land', 'Urbanization', 'Arts']",7.583660130718955,"['Time/5.795959595959596', 'Culture/3.0', 'Mind/2.7411764705882353']","['Time', 'Culture', 'Mind']",11.53713606654783,0.0
Mikala Dwyer,"The large installation Square Cloud Compound explores ideas of impermanence, flight and escape. The work includes a colourful fabric-cube canopy held up by a number of lamp posts painted in prison stripes. The posts stand upright like sentinels, not only supporting the work but also holding it down with stockings pulled to snapping point. The work is an enclosure of sensory and tactile experiences, with trinkets and charms that suggest magic, bird boxes that allude to flight and departure, and lights to illuminate the way.

For this work, Mikala Dwyer has integrated all kinds of materials – from plants, mirrors, trinkets, fabric and Perspex to clay, helium, wood, paint and wool – in distinctive combinations, exploring the relationship between viewers and objects and the everyday visible and invisible forces that surround us. Interested in ritual, sexuality, magic, memory and history, and influenced by dada, constructivism and arte povera, Dwyer’s work pushes at the traditional limits of sculpture and installation.

Square Cloud Compound is, in part, a response to Cockatoo Island, the largest island in Sydney Harbour and a former penal colony and industrial school for girls. Dwyer spent time there in 2010 creating work for the Biennale of Sydney. Square Cloud Compound is partly inspired by that residency and by the darker histories and psychological moods of the island. The grim historical associations of Dwyer’s enclosure are offset by its exuberant and playful materiality. The fabric squares float like the clouds – a square cloud compound.",Square Cloud Compound,"['compound.n.01', 'cloud.n.01 compound.n.01', 'cloud.n.01', 'square.n.01 cloud.n.01', 'square.n.01', 'post.n.01', 'enclosure.n.01', 'magic.n.01', 'flight.n.01', 'island.n.01', 'fabric.n.01', 'sydney.n.01', 'history.n.01', 'ritual.a.01', 'response.n.01', 'push.n.01', 'psychological.s.01', 'playful.a.01', 'plant.n.01', 'paint.n.01', 'industrial.a.01', 'girl.n.01', 'force.n.01', 'distinctive.s.01', 'colony.n.01']","['haptic', 'flight', 'inprisionment', 'tactile', 'magic', 'ritual', 'materiality']","['Body', 'Materiality', 'Fantasy']","['Physics', 'Fantasy', 'Materiality']","['Body', 'Immaterial', 'History']","['Materiality', 'Arts', 'History']",[],"['Culture/1.8235294117647058', 'History/1.8235294117647058', 'Mind/1.6']","['Culture', 'History', 'Mind']",5.247058823529412,"['History/4.36923076923077', 'Urbanization/4.1692307692307695', 'Physics/3.314285714285714']","['History', 'Urbanization', 'Physics']",11.852747252747253,0.3333333333333333
Shaun Gladwell,"Storm Sequence is a deceptively simple work. It depicts the solitary action of a skateboarder – the artist, Shaun Gladwell – freestyling on the edge of a concrete drop at Sydney’s Bondi Beach. The camera hardly moves and concentrates only on the skateboarder’s movements. Gladwell – a skillful freestyle skateboarder – pirouettes and spins within a contained space. Incorporating an organic, liquid-like soundtrack by Sydney composer Kazumichi Grime, the footage is slowed down. Movement which in real time would have a jerky rhythm becomes graceful, emphasising the relationship between the skater and the environment. As a storm approaches on the horizon, Gladwell skates while the sky turns black and the rain becomes too heavy for him to continue. The strange, poetic intervention of the natural world, combined with the well-known nature of the place where it is performed, creates a compelling and mesmeric work.

Gladwell often portrays isolated figures, undertaking choreographed acts like skateboarding or breakdancing, within urban and natural sites. His work articulates a relationship between the performer’s body and its immediate environment through slowed motion, often redefining the prescribed function of objects and spaces.",Storm Sequence,"['skateboarder.n.01', 'decelerate.v.01', 'storm.n.01', 'sydney.n.01', 'motion.n.03', 'natural.a.01', 'environment.n.01', 'space.n.01', 'relationship.n.01', 'poetic.a.01', 'performer.n.01', 'perform.v.01', 'organic.a.01', 'graceful.a.01', 'gesture.n.02', 'soundtrack.n.01', 'sky.n.01', 'simple.a.01', 'real.a.01', 'edge.n.01', 'urban.a.01', 'footage.n.01', 'nature.n.01', 'function.n.01', 'figure.n.01']","['temporality', 'movement', 'environment', 'choreography', 'poesis', 'nature', 'skateboarding']","['Body', 'Time', 'Environmental']","['Body', 'Land', 'Environmental']","['Body', 'Environmental', 'Time']","['Environmental', 'Land', 'Time']",['Environmental'],"['Arts/6.504010025062656', 'Geopolitics/3.2026143790849675', 'Media/2.3790849673202614']","['Arts', 'Geopolitics', 'Media']",12.085709371467885,"['Geopolitics/4.952614379084967', 'Urbanization/2.8', 'Familial/1.7230769230769232']","['Geopolitics', 'Urbanization', 'Familial']",9.47569130216189,0.3333333333333333
Christian Thomson,"Christian Thompson’s Gamu Mambu (Blood Song) is a single-channel video featuring a baroque opera singer performing a traditional Bidjara song. Thompson is a Bidjara man of the Kunja nation from Central West Queensland who references his Indigenous Australian and European heritage to engage with broader ideas regarding cultural identity. The complex multi-syllabic language sung in the overwrought and heavily cultured baroque style is unexpected, but also strangely mesmerising and enthralling. The Dutch performer sings straight to the camera against a coloured backdrop, evoking the simplicity of early performance video art from the 1970s. The translation of the lyrics into English at the bottom of the screen reveals a story that is simple but direct.

The minimal style of the video highlights the incongruity between the singer’s operatic performance, the complexity of the Bidjara language and the song’s bold narrative. The disjunction between the narrative and performance of the song confuses our understanding and comprehension of what it is we are seeing. Despite, or because of, the incongruity, the performance resonates emotionally. The power of Gamu Mambu (Blood Song) lies simply in the different interpretations of the song through performance and text. It is language taken from one source, reinterpreted and presented in a different context. It is also an affirmation of the power of the voice, a reminder that performance and song are powerful tools in communicating and understanding human culture.",Gamu Mambu (Blood Song),"['song.n.01', 'performance.n.01', 'thompson.n.01', 'performance.n.01 song.n.01', 'singer.n.01', 'language.n.01', 'power.n.01', 'video.n.01', 'narrative.n.01', 'manner.n.01', 'voice.n.01', 'translation.n.01', 'reminder.n.01', 'prosecute.v.03', 'performer.n.01', 'european.a.01', 'disjunction.n.01', 'cultural.a.01 identity.n.01', 'tool.n.01', 'simple.a.01', 'queensland.n.01', 'powerful.a.01', 'human.a.01', 'heritage.n.01', 'context.n.01']","['cultural identity', 'indigenous', 'incongruity', 'interpretation', 'language', 'communication', 'song']","['Language', 'Identity', 'Culture']","['Emotion', 'Colonization', 'Arts']","['Culture', 'Identity', 'Language']","['Language', 'Identity', 'Culture']",[],"['Culture/3.8461538461538463', 'Media/3.4065934065934065', 'Power/3.076923076923077']","['Culture', 'Media', 'Power']",10.32967032967033,"['Arts/5.347619047619047', 'Language/2.888888888888889', 'Fantasy/2.709090909090909']","['Arts', 'Language', 'Fantasy']",10.945598845598845,0.0
Gulumbu Yunupingu,"Gulumbu Yunupingu’s vision of the night sky is one of light rather than dark. ‘My story is of the universe’, she has explained. ‘These stars are for us to see if we wish, wherever we are.’1

Yunupingu’s painting practice honours her two major influences: her father and her mother. In artworks by her father, the renowned Gumatj painter Mungurruway Yunupingu, the cruciform structure of Yunupingu’s stars is evident. He was also influential in her overall approach to subject: ‘I found the story of the constellations from the sacred songs my father used to sing. We grew up listening to him sing about them. Every day at dawn he would sing until the sun came up.’ And it was with her mother, a Galpu woman named Makurrngu, that she imagined the ‘seeing-eye’ dots that mark the middle of her stars. One night while camping Gulumbu awoke thinking it was raining, but her mother reassured her it wasn’t and said that maybe the stars were crying.

In Gan'yu – stars Yunupingu’s treasury of stars adorns a funeral pole, representing the role of the night sky in the afterlife. ‘Memorial poles are the ones of dead people’, Yunupingu explained. ‘We don’t know what the spirit is and where it goes. Maybe up to the sky.’

Yunupingu weaves with light, the crossed arms of her stars knitting together the rich tapestry that envelops her barks and hollow logs. The effect is buoyant, a proclamation of hope. Her constellations are a ‘metaphor for our universal humanity, the people of the past, present and future … a message of peace and unity’",Gan'yu - stars,"['star.n.01', 'father.n.01', 'night.n.01', 'mother.n.01', 'sky.n.01', 'pole.n.01', 'configuration.n.01', 'night.n.01 sky.n.01', 'light.n.01', 'narrative.n.01', 'people.n.01', 'song.n.01', 'sacred.a.01', 'point.n.09', 'hope.n.01', 'future.a.01', 'dead.a.01', 'dark.n.01', 'cosmopolitan.s.03', 'woman.n.01', 'vision.n.01', 'structure.n.01', 'influence.n.01', 'metaphor.n.01', 'celebrated.s.01']","['stars', 'cosmology', 'family', 'spirit', 'tradition', 'ceremony']","['Spirituality', 'Familial', 'Culture']","['Familial', 'Spirituality', 'Space']","['Community', 'History', 'Mind']","['Familial', 'Space', 'Spirituality']",[],"['Space/7.823443223443223', 'Mind/5.6743589743589755', 'Arts/4.689724310776942']","['Space', 'Mind', 'Arts']",18.18752650857914,"['Space/7.823443223443223', 'Familial/7.78021978021978', 'Arts/5.719413919413919']","['Space', 'Familial', 'Arts']",21.323076923076922,0.6666666666666666
Ah Xian,"This porcelain bust is the eighty-first in a series by Ah Xian, a Chinese-born artist who migrated to Australia in the late 1980s.  Each bust in the series is cast from a live model – either Ah Xian’s family members or friends – and each is finished in a different hand-painted and glazed decoration.  The cobalt-blue landscape of clouds, trees and pagodas that imprints China, China – Bust 81 is based on a traditional Chinese porcelain design, perfected in the highly specialised workshops and kilns of Jingdezhen in central China during the Ming and Qing dynasties.  For centuries, Jingdezhen was the centre of China’s global export of porcelain, a powerhouse of artisanal techniques and processes that were unrivalled anywhere else in the world. After the communist revolution in 1949 and the cultural revolution of the 1960s, agriculture and industrialisation were prioritised over traditional artisanal processes. Some of the workshops in Jingdezhen were reoriented to the production of statues and busts of Chairman Mao, and a social realist style prevailed over traditional patterns.

Ah Xian’s use of these once-threatened skills was in an effort to revive them, and in protest against state suppression of creativity and the devaluation of traditional Chinese culture. Following the methods of conceptual art, he produces each bust by issuing a set of instructions to the master craftspeople who paint, glaze and fire them. Each bust is, then, a collaboration between the individual and the group, fusing time-honoured techniques with contemporary methods. Through this approach, and by casting from the bodies of ordinary people, Ah Xian democratizes the format of the bust, which has generally been reserved for the likenesses of political leaders and statesman.

The Naqshbandi Sufi Muslims are mystics who believe that one’s journey in life is the path of return to God. Sabsabi’s project presents us with a rare and privileged view into the spiritual and communal gatherings of members of the Greenacre order in western Sydney. Sabsabi has recorded continuous footage of one of their weekly gatherings in a Greenacre scout hall, which he screens on three monitors placed on the gallery floor. In front of the monitors is a carpet and low table, where viewers are invited to sit and engage with the experience they see before them – Sufi Muslims practising the devotional act of Zkir, in which prayers are chanted aloud.

The view provided by the static camera is of a nondescript room, enlivened by the presence of adults and children who sit on the floor and chant together to the beat of a tar, an Arabic drum. Toddlers wander from one person to the next and lie in the laps of their seated parents. Plastic folders with the words of the chants, of which one is presented on the low table of the installation, are passed around, from which people recite aloud or silently. The natural and unaffected interactions of the devotees in the ordinary space they occupy underscores their purposeful gathering, in which spirituality and transcendence are enacted through a communion of souls. The Naqshbandi Sufis, who come from a variety of cultural backgrounds, invited the artist into their ceremonial setting, allowing him (and us as his audience) to witness a room that eloquently explores the subtle social realities of shared spirituality, within the context of an everyday, suburban, Australian existence.",Naqshbandi Greenacre Engagement,"['sufi.n.01', 'gathering.n.01', 'sufi.n.01 muslim.n.01', 'spiritualty.n.01', 'chant.n.01', 'table.n.01', 'position.n.03', 'proctor.n.01', 'muslim.n.01', 'floor.n.01', 'share.v.01', 'rug.n.01', 'prosecute.v.03', 'presence.n.01', 'parent.n.01', 'ordain.v.01', 'inactive.s.10', 'ceremonial.s.01', 'booklet.n.01', 'world.n.03', 'setting.n.01', 'ordinary.a.01', 'inspire.v.01', 'context.n.01', 'western.a.01']","['islam', 'prayer', 'gathering', 'community', 'family', 'suburban', 'australia']","['Spirituality', 'Community', 'Familial']","['Spirituality', 'Community', 'Culture']","['Spirituality', 'Community', 'Time']","['Community', 'Spirituality', 'Familial']","['Community', 'Spirituality']","['Community/6.111655011655012', 'Spirituality/4.624509803921569', 'Urbanization/3.358974358974359']","['Community', 'Spirituality', 'Urbanization']",14.09513917455094,"['Land/4.741025641025642', 'Politics/4.0', 'Materiality/3.45970695970696']","['Land', 'Politics', 'Materiality']",12.200732600732602,0.0
Justene Williams,"Crutch Dance is part of a cycle of work by Justene Williams that pushes lens-based imagery into painterly, performance and sculptural realms. This work relates closely to a group of moving-image works in which Williams creates overwhelming environments constructed from detritus, photographs and suburban props. In the case of Crutch Dance, Williams has used a salvaged treadmill. The bizarre environments that the artist makes become the stage for increasingly odd actions built around repetitive, collaged movements – running, dancing, ducking and weaving like a punch-drunk three-dimensional painting. Here, a futurist figure vainly does battle with the treadmill, jerking with movement akin to a futurist or cubist dance and invoking Umberto Boccioni’s famous sculpture Unique Forms of Continuity in Space (1913).

This delirious choreography in its fabulist setting has the aura of voodoo, with the artist channelling a period from art history in an effort to reconstruct the essence of forgotten images. Through the physical collaging of materials to construct her complex sets and costumes, and the digital collaging and editing of video, Williams invokes the ghosts of artists past. The work itself has a sculptural presence – it is displayed on teetering accumulations of television monitors, placed on top of hastily painted wooden pallets. The monitors remind us of their own obsolescence – they are big, bulky, black boxes that are disappearing fast – as opposed to stylish, thin plasma screens. Williams’ embrace of both high and low art, history and salvage, painting and video, results in a hypnotic new form of recycling – a curiously ‘carbon neutral’ method of image production.",Crutch Dance,"['williams.n.01', 'dance.n.01', 'crutch.n.01 dance.n.01', 'crutch.n.01', 'sculptural.a.01', 'construct.v.01', 'proctor.n.01', 'motion.n.03', 'environment.n.01', 'video.n.01', 'history.n.01', 'form.n.01', 'presence.n.01', 'odd.a.01', 'futuristic.a.01', 'futurist.n.01', 'embrace.n.01', 'digital.a.01 editing.n.01', 'cycle.n.01', 'continuity.n.01', 'box.n.01', 'image.n.01', 'time_period.n.01', 'setting.n.01', 'set.n.01']","['saturated', 'environment', 'movement', 'frenetic', 'art history', 'detritus']","['Fantasy', 'Materiality', 'Arts']","['Fantasy', 'Culture', 'Materiality']","['Culture', 'Mass media', 'Fantasy']","['Environmental', 'Technology', 'Physics']",[],"['Geopolitics/3.2026143790849675', 'Environmental/2.575854700854701', 'Body/1.0']","['Geopolitics', 'Environmental', 'Body']",6.7784690799396685,"['Time/5.317748917748918', 'Arts/5.20392156862745', 'Materiality/5.037484737484737']","['Time', 'Arts', 'Materiality']",15.559155223861106,0.0
Vernon Ah Kee,"Vernon Ah Kee’s text-based video work Whitefellanormalblackfellame engages the viewer in a confrontational relationship with the artist. Originally commissioned by SBS Television and the Australian Centre for Moving Image, the video is the first of the artist’s moving-image artworks. It uses an economy of means – simple ‘universal’ black-and-white font, and sharp editing between a portrait of the artist and flashing text – to critique the position of an Indigenous person within contemporary social and cultural life. The video incorporates a number of performative elements that create an immediate relationship with the viewer, including the barrage of text, the stance of the artist, the repetition of words such as ‘fella’, the use of space, the disjuncture between the audio and the written text, and the act of reading and understanding. Additionally, the fast pacing of the text and audio creates a sense of action and urgency. The viewer completes the work through participation in the form of reading and listening, taking an active role in the work’s success or failure.",Whitefellanormalblackfellame,"['reading.n.01', 'spectator.n.01', 'video.n.01', 'relationship.n.01', 'elements.n.01', 'disjunction.n.01', 'cultural.a.01 life.n.01', 'cosmopolitan.s.03', 'simple.a.01', 'sense.n.01', 'review.v.02', 'editing.n.01', 'centre.n.01', 'black-and-white.a.01', 'television.n.01', 'position.n.01', 'understanding.n.01', 'social.a.01', 'artwork.n.01', 'action.n.01', 'function.n.03', 'contemporary.s.01', 'portrayal.n.01', 'space.n.01', 'person.n.01']","['indigeneity', 'confrontation', 'race politics', 'language', 'culture']",,,,,[],"['Language/1.8888888888888888', 'Community/0.9090909090909091', 'Power/0.8']","['Language', 'Community', 'Power']",3.5979797979797983,"['Power/4.8307692307692305', 'Arts/4.122766122766123', 'Language/3.941025641025641']","['Power', 'Arts', 'Language']",12.894560994560996,0.6666666666666666
Mabel Anaka-anaburra,"Mabel Anaka-anaburra was a fibre artist from Maningrida, central Arnhem Land, Northern Territory. Her bamagora, or conical mat, is woven from the leaves of the Pandanus (Pandanus Spiralis) plant, which grows near the water courses and coast line of Maningrida, halfway between Darwin and the Gove Peninsula. Made by women at Maningrida Art Centre, these traditional mats are used for a variety of purposes ranging from the utilitarian to the ceremonial. Conical mats serve many roles. In their flattened form, they can be used to sleep on or for women’s business, thus bamagora have a particular relationship to female experience and the cycles of life. As an upright cone, bamagora are regularly used to shield sleeping babies from mosquitos and flies, and to cover sacred objects of ritual significance. Weaving is an important industry in community, and is used to make fish traps, nets, baskets and dilly bags. Family groups will strip young leaves from the pandanus plant with a hooked stick, and boil them over the campfire with natural dyes made from the roots, bulbs, seeds and leaves of locally sourced plants. The coloured leaves are woven together in a circular pattern of coloured bands to form the conical mats. Bamagora are aesthetic objects as well as practical ones, expressing their makers’ colour and weaving-style preferences, and incorporating new practices through experimentation with plants and fibres to create variations in form, colour and texture.",Bamagora (conical pandanus palm mat),"['mat.n.01', 'leaf.n.01', 'plant.n.01', 'pandanus.n.01', 'conic.a.01 mat.n.01', 'conic.a.01', 'pandanus.n.01 plant.n.01', 'weave.v.01', 'woman.n.01', 'colored.a.01', 'object.n.01', 'form.n.01', 'significance.n.01', 'set.n.05', 'sacred.a.01', 'round.a.01', 'ritual.a.01', 'practical.a.01', 'cycle.n.01', 'cone.n.01', 'community.n.01', 'basket.n.01', 'purpose.n.01', 'land.n.01', 'form.n.03']","['feminity', 'aboriginal', 'culture', 'sacred', 'weaving', 'tradition', '']",,,,,[],"['Arts/4.8198830409356725', 'Mind/4.774358974358975', 'Culture/3.269230769230769']","['Arts', 'Mind', 'Culture']",12.863472784525417,"['Land/3.4835164835164836', 'Design/3.3076923076923075', 'Mind/3.2717948717948717']","['Land', 'Design', 'Mind']",10.063003663003663,0.3333333333333333
James Angus,"James Angus’ large Manta Ray sits balanced and motionless on a small plinth within the gallery space. The artist chose this creature for its complex associations, as it is simultaneously familiar and otherworldly, both gentle and intimidating, ancient and yet aerodynamic in shape. The sculptural form is anatomically correct, selected from a moment in underwater film footage that captured the beautiful downward thrust of the fins. The process of recreation involved translation by an industrial designer from the living organism to its virtual description in software. The data was then sent to a computer controlled milling machine where it was carved in solid foam like an industrial prototype, and subsequently cast in fiberglass. The final object is matte white and perfectly smooth, its shape demonstrating the forces of hydrodynamics, as though merged with modern design. This creature of natural history appears to have as much in common with futuristic spacecraft as with evolutionary biology.

The translation of animate to inanimate, and of movement to stillness is central to the long history of sculpture. In this case the immaculate surface of the constructed ray is at odds with the wet and slippery living organism, its dark hued top, mottled edges and pale underside. Angus frequently works with familiar forms, yet disturbs them to unsettle the viewer’s sense of reality. He has said that he was hoping that Manta Ray would appear “simultaneously alive and deathly”, conveying the disquieting underside of technology, digital effects and media. The fact that many rays including the Giant Manta Ray and Giant Devil Ray are now vulnerable or endangered raises another association with the still form.",Manta Ray,"['beam.n.04', 'manta.n.01 beam.n.04', 'manta.n.01', 'organism.n.01', 'giant.n.01', 'bottom.n.01', 'translation.n.01', 'industrial.a.01', 'animal.n.01', 'familiar.a.01', 'shape.n.01', 'association.n.01', 'form.n.01', 'history.n.01', 'technology.n.01', 'surface.n.01', 'solid.s.01', 'sculptural.a.01', 'satan.n.01', 'pale.s.01', 'odds.n.01', 'hush.n.01', 'futuristic.a.01', 'force.n.01', 'foam.n.01']","['nature', 'artifice', 'tension', 'technology', 'digital media', 'design']",,,,,[],"['Arts/5.647058823529411', 'Technology/1.9', 'Design/1.7777777777777777']","['Arts', 'Technology', 'Design']",9.32483660130719,"['Design/4.085470085470085', 'Arts/4.084213172448466', 'Power/4.083516483516483']","['Design', 'Arts', 'Power']",12.253199741435035,0.6666666666666666
