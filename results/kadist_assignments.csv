"Jennifer Allora, Guillermo Calzadilla","This series of photographs is part of the body of work Allora & Calzadilla made regarding the situation in Vieques, an island off the mainland of Puerto Rico used for the 60 years by the U.S Military and NATO forces to practice military bombing exercises. In 2000, they began a collaboration with the local activists to make the campaign more visible. Having added cast rubber reliefs of their slogans and designs to the soles of their shoes, the activists stamped their protest on the reclaimed land. By slightly manipulating everyday objects to become communication tools, Allora & Calzadilla had created “mobile print-making machines” (Yates McKee, October 133, Summer 2010). They then photographed the ephemeral aftermath of these mark-making actions.  Like graffitied walls, the details of these impressions on sandy grounds are landscapes of dissent, willing the transition of propriety back to the inhabitants. In Land Mark #12, numerous footsteps with long statements stamp their resentment in different confused orientations. Such a beach scene might at first misleadingly be associated with a playful holiday snap. The fragility, uncertainty and relentlessness of this struggle is poetically summarized in this close-up of meaningful site-specific expression. The artists wrote: “How is land differentiated from other land by the way it is marked? Who decides what is worth preserving and what should be destroyed? What are the strategies for reclaiming marked land? How does one articulate an ethics and politics of land use?” (in Land Mark, de Tokyo, Paris, 2006).","Jennifer Allora and Guillermo Calzadilla comprise the artistic duo Allora & Calzadilla.

Herrero’s works are full of energy and life, hovering somewhere between painted-over graffiti and painterly abstraction. Additionally, bright and varied colors combine with shapes resembling eyes to give some of his pieces a more cartoon-like sensibility..

The artist uses objects or “poor” situations, found in the everyday landscape, natural or urban. By their division, their juxtaposition, or collage, inventing semantic or sensitive scenarios, always surprising, sometimes humorous and sometimes lyrical … The sculptural practice of the artist, inseparable from his drawings, photographs, or films, invents relationships of space, and disrupts our perception of objects.

The artist, who is the son of muralist Mario Orozco Riviera, questions the boundaries of his artistic identity in Mexico. In “Crazy tourist” (1991), Orozco creates a situation with oranges in the Brazilian market tables in a desert. The artist uses objects or “poor” situations, found in the everyday landscape, natural or urban. By their division, their juxtaposition, or collage, inventing semantic or sensitive scenarios, always surprising, sometimes humorous and sometimes lyrical … The sculptural practice of the artist, inseparable from his drawings, photographs, or films, invents relationships of space, and disrupts our perception of objects. Such is the case of “Yielding Stone” (1992), a photo of a plasticine ball, the weight of the artist, rolled through the streets of New York. Gabriel Orozco was born in 1962 in Jalapa, Mexico. He lives and works in New York, Mexico, and Paris..

Gregory Crewdson,"Forest Gathering N.2 is part of the series of photographs Beneath the Roses (2003-2005) where anonymous townscapes, forest clearings and broad, desolate streets are revealed as sites of mystery and wonder; similarly, ostensibly banal interiors become the staging grounds for strange human scenarios.

Never anchored precisely in time or place, these and the other narratives of Beneath the Roses are rather located in the dystopic landscape of the anxious American imagination.

Maria Bussman,"The drawing “Heidegger’s Cabin” (2005) is inspired by Martin Heidegger’s essay, “The Origin of the Work of Art.” During the artist’s stay in a high alpine area, near a lake reservoir, Bussmann related the landscape in her surroundings to her reading of Heidegger’s terms on the work of art and the meaning of a “thing.” In attempt to link spiritual heights to natural heights, Bussmann metaphorically relates the subjects of being and truth to a hiking path, and its different degrees of challenge and risk. In the drawings rather than finding the optimal path to reach ultimate meaning and materialization, Bussmann never arrives at “Heidegger’s Cabin,” and instead is led off the beaten track to areas she never discovered before. Upon her return from the mountains in 2004 and 2005, she continued to develop the series, leading up to 20 drawings on handmade paper that attempt to problematize Heidegger’s theory on artworks as “things” as bearers of traits, “things” confronting the world of perception, and “things” as formed matter.","Maria Bussmann’s works represent an insistent attempt to fathom the epistemological quality of her medium, drawing. For the artist, drawing is the most direct form of artistic expression, both as a medium of analysis and of communication.  Her work traditionally grows out of her relationship to reading and the generative force of philosophy and literature, as well as personal references such as temporary sites of residence. Authors that have inspired her work include philosophers Heidegger, Merleau-Ponty, Wittgenstein and Apuleius. Her drawings, at times exhibited as scrolls, exist as open-ended commentaries and annotations to philosophical thinking rather than illustrations of readings or experiences. While reading and thinking, the artist transfers visual ideas that develop in her mind into a two-dimensional space making the drawing expansive. In a transformational process, individual pictorial elements appear like encoded emblems, resulting in a rich textual interwoven fabric.

Zarina Bhimji,"Born in Uganda of Indian descent, Bhimji has lived in London after her family sought refuge from the regime of Idi Amin who compulsorily expelled all Asians from Uganda. Her recent work has been concerned with revisiting the country of her childhood and engaging with the experience of exile, political and social destruction, and deprivation. This photograph, which belongs to the series “Love”, was shot by Bhimji during her journey in Uganda in 2001, but was only edited in 2006. It depicts Entebbe airport, the site of evacuation of Asian refugees as well as the site of a daring attempt to resolve a hijacking crisis by Israeli forces in 1976. Although still functioning, principally for private aircraft, it is dilapidated. Commercial flights use a more modern airport, as though Entebbe airport is too scarred by history to be reused. The contrast between the private aircraft and the destitute building is striking. The work evokes a bygone era as well as the consequences of enforced action. The play of light and shadow is emphatic, the dark interior, with its lattice window frames, evoking prison conditions in contrast to the verdant open landscape. The title of the work refers to Bhimji’s father and his decision to leave Uganda, thus closing a chapter of the family history. By returning to Uganda, Bhimji has reopened it.","Zarina Bhimji’s films and photographs result from prolonged research in the field. Over the past few years she has traveled to Zanzibar, India and East Africa (including Uganda where she was born), retracing the path of the former British colonists. However the artworks produced from her enquiries are not in the documentary genre: she is interested in evoking human presence in places where it is absent, but where an atmospheric tension resulting from previous tragic events is still felt.Notwithstanding the manifestation of an acute political awareness in her work, Zarina Bhimji does not neglect the visual aspect: architecture is put to good use in her meticulous compositions, walls being a recurring motif of her visual vocabulary. Her landscapes are sometimes close to abstraction, yet one can feel in them the power of past violence. The beauty and poetry emerging from the images evince a feeling of wonder mixed with a profound melancholy, in the romantic tradition.Zarina Bhimji was born in Mbarara, Uganda in 1963.

However the artworks produced from her enquiries are not in the documentary genre: she is interested in evoking human presence in places where it is absent, but where an atmospheric tension resulting from previous tragic events is still felt.Notwithstanding the manifestation of an acute political awareness in her work, Zarina Bhimji does not neglect the visual aspect: architecture is put to good use in her meticulous compositions, walls being a recurring motif of her visual vocabulary. Her landscapes are sometimes close to abstraction, yet one can feel in them the power of past violence. The beauty and poetry emerging from the images evince a feeling of wonder mixed with a profound melancholy, in the romantic tradition.Zarina Bhimji was born in Mbarara, Uganda in 1963. She now lives and works in London.. Bapa Closed His Heart.

Douglas Gordon,"Blind Spencer is part of the series “Blind Stars” including hundreds of works in which the artist cut out the eyes of Hollywood stars, in a symbolically violent manner. An emptiness (some are burned letting appear a white or mirror background or a mirror) replaces the eyes, giving the impression of a blind eye deprived of all expression. Paradoxically, the work looks at us all the more intensely. The glamorous black and white portrait of Spencer Tracy evokes the golden age of Hollywood, with all of its codes like seductive smiles and directional light, not to mention a perverse use of the gaze.  Gordon talks about his work as a process of “research, memory, of stories that took place, the films I’ve seen … I am interested in looking for what happens when you look at something so long that it disappears. You are viewing an image, you start looking through the image, and you reach the other side and then you return to the surface. ” This act of cutting, pertinent to a new generation of artists focusing on the ready-made, image fragments and found sound footage, juxtaposes temporalities like in video editing and introduces a hint of melancholy. The act of cutting fascinates and repels, in what Freud called an experience of “the uncanny.” The viewer can only contemplate a loss of the soul which is traditionally reflected in the eyes. After Andy Warhol and his celebrity portraits, Douglas Gordon tracks the iconic and deadly character of his subjects.","Douglas Gordon is a celebrated Scottish artist whose work revolves around the themes of memory, time and our perception of it. Spanning across film, video, installation, photography, and sculpture, his work offers a new experience of the cinematic in the space of contemporary art, creating what critic Dominique Païni described as ‘exhibition cinema.’      Interested in how we experience temporality, Gordon has often slowed down either original or appropriated footage in order to play with the viewers’ perception. An example is his celebrated work 24 Hour Psycho (1993), in which Gordon stretched the duration of Alfred Hitchcock’s iconic movie to last 24 hours. This gesture both monumentalized time and intensified the imagery, structurally reframing the film by shifting our perception away from the movie’s original narrative and directing it towards the finer details that constitute every single frame.     Several of his works incorporate that universal dichotomies: of life and death, innocence and guilt, and dual identities.

Joachim Koester,"Tarantism is the name of disease which appeared in southern Italy, resulting from the bite of a spider called Tarantula. This bite caused various symptoms, such as nausea, difficulty to speak, delusion, excitability and agitation. The victims suffered then from convulsions and the only way to heal them was to engage in a frenzied dance, as it was believed.  Called “Tarantella”, this dance, appeared during the Middle Ages and was danced all along the 19th century.  To make this video, the artist asked a group of dancers to perform this uncontrolled dance in order to explore this borderline mental and physical state, close to a trance. Tarantism represents a transition in the artist’s work, who brings a story back to life simply through the movement of these completely disarticulate bodies, without referring to images extracted from reality, thus exploring a purely mental territory.","With a keen interest in the stranger corners of the long human story, and a persistent interest in the supernatural, the transcendent, and the psychedelic, Joachim Koester’s work follows the artists own undying interest in physical and psychological limits.

This bite caused various symptoms, such as nausea, difficulty to speak, delusion, excitability and agitation. The victims suffered then from convulsions and the only way to heal them was to engage in a frenzied dance, as it was believed.  Called “Tarantella”, this dance, appeared during the Middle Ages and was danced all along the 19th century.  To make this video, the artist asked a group of dancers to perform this uncontrolled dance in order to explore this borderline mental and physical state, close to a trance. Tarantism represents a transition in the artist’s work, who brings a story back to life simply through the movement of these completely disarticulate bodies, without referring to images extracted from reality, thus exploring a purely mental territory.. With a keen interest in the stranger corners of the long human story, and a persistent interest in the supernatural, the transcendent, and the psychedelic, Joachim Koester’s work follows the artists own undying interest in physical and psychological limits.

Meschac Gaba,"The headdresses, woven from artificial hair braids, symbolize historical icons including Martin Luther King, Kwame Nkrumah, Fela Kuti and King Guézo of Dahomey. The wigs portraying these grand figures also unambiguously recall Africa to mind. By declaring Cotonou, one of Benin’s cities, the Art Museum of Real Life, and by having thirty white-clad figures wearing Gaba’s latest series of tresses cross through it, he draws attention to the urban space and its inhabitants’ strategies of survival and improvisation. In doing this, he enquires into alternative models, and into the tasks and local interpretations of the museum: “The micro-macro economy represents the survival of the inhabitants of this city day after day (…) In the city of Cotonou, you can see installations everywhere – it is like an open-air museum.” In this series Meschac Gaba weaves symbolic crowns that suggest a historical character, suggested through one of her or his realizations. Here in the case of former Beninese president Hubert Maga, the hairstyle headdress is woven in the form of a hospital that was built during his reign and was named after him. The forms and styles of braided hairstyles range from purely functional to complex and symbolic: hair can be an indicator of age, authority, social status, religion or even supernatural powers. In cities across Europe and the Americas, African hair braiders produce extravagant creations based on their traditional braiding skills and styles, uniting capitalist commerce with traditional culture. In Gaba´s work, two seemingly divergent products of humankind, hair and architecture, meet as equally significant symbols of modern culture. In making this work, Gaba assumes the role of the nouveau tresseur or tresseuse (the new braider), a traditional Beninese hair braider, reassigning meaning to architectural forms and cultural experiences.","born in 1961 in Cotonou, Benin.He lives and works between Cotonou and Rotterdam  Over the past 20 years, through various bodies of works, Beninese artist Meshac Gaba has attempted to reframe contemporary African artistic identity, asking us to shed our preconceived ideas and re-imagine the African continent with a more valid contemporary image. Meschac Gaba emerged onto the international contemporary art scene in 1999 when he presented the Museum of Contemporary African Art in the exhibition “Mirror’s Edge” at Bilmuseet in Umea, Sweden. It marked the beginning of an expansive conceptual and virtual project based on the subjectivity of museum spaces.

The wigs portraying these grand figures also unambiguously recall Africa to mind. By declaring Cotonou, one of Benin’s cities, the Art Museum of Real Life, and by having thirty white-clad figures wearing Gaba’s latest series of tresses cross through it, he draws attention to the urban space and its inhabitants’ strategies of survival and improvisation. In doing this, he enquires into alternative models, and into the tasks and local interpretations of the museum: “The micro-macro economy represents the survival of the inhabitants of this city day after day (…) In the city of Cotonou, you can see installations everywhere – it is like an open-air museum.” In this series Meschac Gaba weaves symbolic crowns that suggest a historical character, suggested through one of her or his realizations. Here in the case of former Beninese president Hubert Maga, the hairstyle headdress is woven in the form of a hospital that was built during his reign and was named after him. The forms and styles of braided hairstyles range from purely functional to complex and symbolic: hair can be an indicator of age, authority, social status, religion or even supernatural powers. In cities across Europe and the Americas, African hair braiders produce extravagant creations based on their traditional braiding skills and styles, uniting capitalist commerce with traditional culture. In Gaba´s work, two seemingly divergent products of humankind, hair and architecture, meet as equally significant symbols of modern culture. In making this work, Gaba assumes the role of the nouveau tresseur or tresseuse (the new braider), a traditional Beninese hair braider, reassigning meaning to architectural forms and cultural experiences.. born in 1961 in Cotonou, Benin.He lives and works between Cotonou and Rotterdam  Over the past 20 years, through various bodies of works, Beninese artist Meshac Gaba has attempted to reframe contemporary African artistic identity, asking us to shed our preconceived ideas and re-imagine the African continent with a more valid contemporary image. Meschac Gaba emerged onto the international contemporary art scene in 1999 when he presented the Museum of Contemporary African Art in the exhibition “Mirror’s Edge” at Bilmuseet in Umea, Sweden. It marked the beginning of an expansive conceptual and virtual project based on the subjectivity of museum spaces.

Haris Epaminonda,"Created from extracts of kitsch movies or Greek soap operas from the 1960s, these videos are like audiovisual ‘postcards’ reflecting a nostalgic and melancholic approach. The images have lost their context and original meaning to then be re-assembled, confronted to each other and superimposed with other elements, to reveal new sequences. The narration has disappeared from the sequences and the spectator waits in vain for something to happen.  In “Tarahi V”, the saturated colors of the sequences collected from 1960 films seem to give a new life to the characters (the little girl in pink with her doll, the couple walking backwards, etc.) while the fireworks, superimposed throughout the film provide a disenchanting aspect to the whole scene. Recalling Hitchcock as well as René Magritte, “Tarahi V” presents a pending moment providing the shots and the characters with ghostly appearances.

Meiro Koizumi,"This video installation was made for the exhibition “Journey to the West” held in January 2012 in New Delhi, where a group of curators invited six Japanese artists to produce a work to be made around the relationship between Japan and India. In the framework of this exhibition, Meiro Koizumi decided to use a controversial book of modern Japanese history The Judgement of Justice Radhabinod Pal, as material for his work. Koizumi created a performance combining the paradoxical context of this book with monstrous representation of Indian gods. The central performer had to read the Judgement of Pal as seriously as possible, while two other performers on the side had to make a comedy out of the situation. It is Koizumi’s attempt to create a new god-like mythical figure that embodies the contradiction inscribed within modern Japanese history and identity. The context of this work has much to do with the trial held in Tokyo right after the war to judge Japanese war criminals. Judge Pal was the only Asian judge to be invited to the trial, and he was the only one that found all the defendants not guilty.","Meiro Koizumi is a Japanese video and performing artist, born in 1976.

Willie Doherty,"“I focused on how the political and physical merged” analyzes Willie Doherty. Out of the Shadows II plunges us into a dark night lit by a few street lights in a deserted street where a car is parked in the Irish city of Derry. What is at stake is yet to be unearthed. The context of this picture is not revealed immediately. The pre-text or the information and interpretations made ??by the spectator puts the image in the “troubled” political context of Northern Ireland (a car bomb?) led by the sectarian resentment between communities (the wall evokes a zone of non-visibility). In contrast to the iconography of terrorism in the media, Doherty does not capture the moment of violence itself, but rather an “anti-headline,” the location of a possible confrontation, past or future.

Out of the Shadows II plunges us into a dark night lit by a few street lights in a deserted street where a car is parked in the Irish city of Derry. What is at stake is yet to be unearthed. The context of this picture is not revealed immediately. The pre-text or the information and interpretations made ??by the spectator puts the image in the “troubled” political context of Northern Ireland (a car bomb?) led by the sectarian resentment between communities (the wall evokes a zone of non-visibility). In contrast to the iconography of terrorism in the media, Doherty does not capture the moment of violence itself, but rather an “anti-headline,” the location of a possible confrontation, past or future.

Francis Alÿs,"The Nightwatch, which is an ironic reference to the celebrated painting by Rembrandt, follows the course of a fox wandering among the celebrated collections of the National Portrait Gallery in London. The path of the fox, from galleries containing 16th, 17th and 18th century portraits of historic figures from British history hung on plush walls, is circuitous and seemingly random.The fox tracks back and forth, sometimes inspecting the gallery furniture, often walking through the middle of the room but sometimes around its perimeter until eventually it climbs on top of a showcase, covered in fabric where he settles down to sleep. The actions of the fox are observed from the close-circuit television cameras which form part of the museum’s security system. Foxes are now commonly found in London roaming the suburban streets at night-time. They are in a sense flaneurs sauvages. The insertion of a fox in such an august institution is at once bizarre and yet in some sense perfectly normal. There is a constant tension in the film: will the fox do some damage, what attracts him to particualr places that he returns to; how does he decide where he will settle. The fox acculturises to the gallery in the same way he has become acclimatised to the city. The fox is an outsider, an interloper banned from the city that has re-inserted itself. Alys draws a parallel between the fox and himself. ‘No matter how long I have been away, I have one foot in a European culture, and one foot out… A lot of my work has played on the double status’. The theme of surveillance is multi-layered. On the one hand the fox is staking out the gallery; the portraits on the wall appear to be watching him; the security cameras are monitoring both the paintings and the fox and finally, we the viewer are observing the whole action.","Trained as an architect, Alÿs turned to a visual arts based practice in the early 1990s as a more immediate, direct, and effective way of exploring issues related to urbanization, to the ordering and signification of urban space and to the semiotics of its use. His work initiates with a simple action, either by him or others, which is then documented in a range of media. Alÿs explores subjects such as modernizing programs in Latin America and border zones in areas of conflict, often asking about the relevance of poetic acts in politicized situations. Documentation is central to his practice as well as painting, drawing, and video. In his work, When Faith Moves Mountains (2002) made in collaboration with Mexican critic Cuauhtemoc Medina, Alÿs recruited 500 volunteers outside of Lima, Peru. Each person moved a shovel full of sand one step at a time form one side of a dune to the other, and together they moved the entire geographical location of the dune by a few inches. Critic Jean Fisher linked Alÿs’ work to the radical event of precipitating a crisis of meaning, where the exposure of a void of meaning is confronted by its social situation, leading up to some kind of truth.

The title of this sculpture refers to a cloud that provokes very destructive hail and thunderstorms. The sculpture is as fragile and threatening as this meteorological phenomenon – dislocation and explosion loom. In his work, the artist creates assocations between dice, hailstones, meteorites. Different levels of meaning (mankind, the cliCmate, games) are crystallised in this artwork according to concatenation logic that creates a whole. The artist links the individual and the atmosphere, microcosm and macrocosm, in a manner close in spirit to the sociologist Edgar Morin’s concept of complexity (etymologically meaning “what is woven together”), as a web of interlacing.","Evariste Richer constantly invents new standards for measurement which are mostly objects to prompt the spectator’s potential investigations: avalanche probes, a meter drawn from memory, a meter with no measurements… Meteorology, science, magic, mineralogy, photography, optics are his preferred terrains.

In Ecran (Screen, 2008), the weave of a projection screen is blown-up full-scale and takes over the entire room. Evariste Richer makes visible these micro perforations which are usually hidden by the film being projected; he reveals the infra small and ghostly.

Jason Dodge,"In Algeria, Djidjiga Meffre has woven a fabric with a string, a length equal to the distance from the earth to troposphere. Several works by Dodge, with the same title, follow this principle of measurement.  The work, like a synecdoche, is synthesized by its material and its implementation, both of which are fully part of the meaning. The work functions like as a concentrate. Shades of color and texture relate to multiple sensory and visual sensations, evoking a sky-colored night. It is by its concentration in the weaving that the distance can be represented in a concrete way and visible in one glance. To describe the work amounts to producing a story that echoes the myths surrounding the process of weaving. Above the weather opens up multiple narratives; in the etymological sense, the text is a fabric. We can see the work as a magic carpet that allows a moving “imaginary” of the spirit in the atmosphere. The weaving technique used in the work is frequently used by the artist, contributing to Dodge’s overall poetic aesthetics.","Jason Dodge extracts objects from everyday life – of which he adds minimal alterations by  the way that he isolates and presents them. For instance, he collects all the light sources of a house in “Darkness falls on Wolkowyja Poland” (2005), he samples the strings of a violin in “The viola duo of Bela Bartok” (2007), he records on a light sensitive photo paper in “Into Black” (2007), and finally he adds a bell brush chimney sweep in “Ringing Through chimneys” (2007). The artist goes beyond the silent dimension of the object to reveal their narrative potential, triggering fiction. The artist considers them as elements of a broader context. “I ??try to consider my work related to writing, but using a visual language,” says the Dodge. Name placards accompanying works are pretexts for further stories, supplemented by the imagination of the viewer and their inquiries. The artist, as a storyteller, reintroduces stories, the spoken word, and language in the space of the white cube. In Dodge’s work, the readable is not reducible to the visible. It operates like a trompe l’oeil, an image that gives the illusion of distance from reality, yet is blurred by the poetry of the intervention of the artist.  Jason Dodge was born in 1969 in Newton, Pennsylvania, USA.

Simon Starling,"Invited in 2007 to the Museum Folkwang in Essen (Germany), Simon Starling questioned its history: known for its collections and particularly for its early engagement in favor of modern art (including the acquisition and exhibition of works by Cézanne, Gauguin, Van Gogh, Matisse), then destroyed during the Second World War, the museum was pillaged for its masterpieces of ‘degenerate art’ by the nazis. Starling found photographs of a hang dating back to 1929, taken by Albert Renger-Patzsch, the German New Objectivity photographer. Firstly, he researched the artworks that were presented then which for the most part had been restituted or acquired by private collectors after the war. Secondly, he reconstituted this hang. Finally, he took the same pictures as Renger-Patzsch, with the same ‘scientific objectivity’. The result is simple and minimal, and tends to erase any difference with the original. Playing on the notion of author, Starling identically reconstructs (‘Nachbau’ means reconstruction in German), thus he realizes an exact replica of the photographs taken seventy years earlier. By blurring temporalities, the artist manipulates the history of the collections and questions the outcome of the images and the institution in light of this actual reconstruction in the museum. This work can also be understood as an absurd attempt to go back in time in order to correct history.","Simon Starling provokes unexpected crossings between objects, materials and events. He produces hybrid works that seem to come from another space-time continuum. In 1995, he used the aluminium from a chair designed by Jorge Pensi to reproduce nine copies of a beer can found on the Bauhaus site in Dessau, thus creating a condensed history of design in a rather trivial object, turning a piece of rubbish found by chance into the clue of a historical lineage neither absurd nor authentic.While avoiding formal creation ex nihilo, the artist paradoxically behaves like a true demiurge. His works imply processes of metamorphosis quite similar to alchemy.

The simple cardboard boxes are also discarded shipping materials.  The words “Be Oblivion” are a seeming command to fade away into obscurity. This simple phrase resonates as a harbinger of defeat.

Hank Willis Thomas,"Like many of his other sculptural works, the source of I am the Greatest is actually a historical photograph of an identical button pin from the 1960s. I am the Greatest presents the famous quote by Mohammad Ali to think about his important presence in the African American community. In dialogue with the painting I am a Man, also in the Kadist collection, this assertion that begins the same way takes the line from the protest poster several steps further. Ali never asserted that he was the greatest boxer or athlete, but had the audacity to claim that he was THE GREATEST [human being] of all time. For a man who grew up in the segregated south to rise to Ali’s iconic status and to be able to confidently and proudly vocalize his superiority was one of the most powerful, symbolic, and memorable moments in the Civil Rights struggle. Monumentally inflating the scale of the button embodies the ‘larger than life’ presence of Ali as an icon for African Americans to stand up and not only assert their humanity, but to be confident in their ability to succeed and rise up against all obstacles society placed in front of them.","Employing the visual language and terminology of mass media, and appropriating symbols and images from popular culture, Hank Willis Thomas’ work seeks to question and subvert established definitions and positions with regards to personal identity and the narrative of race. It is concerned with history and identity, with the way race and ‘blackness’ has not only been informed but deliberately shaped and constructed by various forces – first through colonialism and slavery, and more recently through mass media and advertising – and reminds us of the financial and economic stakes that have always been involved in representations of race. Working across installation, photography, video, and media work, Thomas maintains his photo conceptualist roots, primarily taking source material from found photographs and archives. These images form the basis from which the artist seeks to uncover the fallacies that history claims as truth.

Walid Raad,"“The Lebanese wars of the past three decades affected Lebanon’s residents physically and psychologically: from the hundred thousand plus who were killed; to the two hundred thousand plus who were wounded; to the million plus who were displaced; to the even more who were psychologically traumatized. Needless to say, the wars also affected Lebanese cities, buildings and institutions. It is clear to me today that these wars also affected colours, lines, shapes and forms. Some of these were affected in a material way and, like burned books or razed monuments, are physically destroyed and lost forever. Others, like looted treasure or politically compromised artworks, remain physically intact but are removed from view, possibly never to be seen again. And yet other colours, lines, shapes and forms, sensing the forthcoming danger, deploy defensive measures: they hide, take refuge, hibernate, camouflage and dissimulate. I expected them to do so in the artworks of past artists. I thought their paintings, sculptures, films, photographs, and drawings would be their most hospitable hosts. I was wrong. Instead, colours, lines, shapes and forms took refuge in unexpected places. They hid in Roman and Arabic letters and numbers; in circles, rectangles and squares; in yellow, blue and green.

Pratchaya Phinthong,"Phinthong provided 5,000 Euros to exchange for Zimbabwean dollars, the most devalued and worthless currency in the world. The ZWD has no legal status outside Zimbabwe. The exchange took place through a network of contacts rather than direct with Zimbabweans. The notes he received range from 1 dollar to 50 trillion. Placing the dollars in stacks and the stacks within a square grid, Phinthong mimics serial minimal sculpture thus reworking an old theme while providing an ironic comment on the value of art. From worthless currency the artist makes valuable art. The currency is no good for anything else. Thus what was once valuable but became worthless becomes valuable again, like the phoenix rising from the ashes. The ephemeral nature of the currency is mirrored in the ephemeral substance of the sculpture which is vulnerable to disruption from movements of air. There is no particular order of placing the notes since the work grew over the course of the exhibition as more notes came in. The final sculpture was intended to be a cubic meter of notes. The sculpture questions not only the value of art but also systems of exchange and the degree to which they are reliable. Like other works in the show where this work was unveiled, What I learned … embraces the concept of time since it is a sculpture that was accrued over a long period.

Gabriel Orozco,,"Gabriel Orozco could be described as a traveler-artist, without a fixed studio. He works following contexts and produces work that flows. “Special Service” (1997) is a collage on a plane ticket, and indicates nomadism, between territories. The artist, who is the son of muralist Mario Orozco Riviera, questions the boundaries of his artistic identity in Mexico. In “Crazy tourist” (1991), Orozco creates a situation with oranges in the Brazilian market tables in a desert. The artist uses objects or “poor” situations, found in the everyday landscape, natural or urban.

Gabriel Orozco,"Gabriel Orozco comments: “In the exhibition [Documenta 11, Kassel, 2002], I tried to connect with the photographs I took in Mali in July. I traveled to Mali for three weeks and took some photographs related to my work. They are very different, but there are links as the graveyard of Timbuktu, which I discovered during the trip. I found the cemetery because I was interested in pottery and ceramics. Research traditions of ceramics were the reason for my trip to Africa in Mali, to understand, learn, appreciate what they did, because it is an important tradition in Mali. And then I discovered the cemetery in Timbuktu. It is interesting to see how the work will take you to discover places you would never have discovered if you did not work. So the link between what you do and what you find in a second time is very interesting. In this context, the exhibition presents one hand tables with ceramics.

Jean-Luc Moulène,"On a piece of paper, the artist has traced two loops in black crayon and placed two eyes where the lines intersect. Cut out of the same photograph, the eyes belong to the same gaze. The first asset of a slip knot is its simplicity, it basically requires a small length of rope. This collage is “apragmatic drawing, a kind of instructions manual” (« Paragraphes pour Jean-Luc Moulène”, ibid.) of Moulène’s work and photographs. Indeed, doesn’t one commonly speak of the photographer’s gaze? The slip knot could be a “a sort of vision’s hieroglyph”: the eye is the node of everything, the optic nerve is the common thread, the vector of information. This collage questions our gaze which cannot embrace both eyes at once (literally staring in the eyes), which is the point made in the series Les filles d’Amsterdam (photographs of prostitutes which place face and sex organs on the same level). In an interview, the artist analyzes his work by proposing a scenario that activates drawing: “in fact it is the question of the figure. Tracing is always a sharing act, something quite surprising occurs when the line loops back: this reflexivity produces the figure. Then one notices that by pulling the lines to separate the eyes, at a certain point they become stuck; and if one separates other lines then the two eyes end up stuck to one another. It is as if these eyes were rolling around in their own orbits. […] As such, I believe that thought is outside, that there is no room for it in the flesh. The other, social space, outside our bodies: that is what enables us to think”.","After training in literature and working in advertising, Jean-Luc Moulène became known in the 1990s for his ‘documentary’ photographic practice. His images could be considered as studies of natural and cultural phenomena; the Objets de grève ( Strike objects) series (1999) documents objects made in factories during social protests. Moulène uses the codes of media images and diverts them to liberate the gaze and produce a new imaginary. This poetic tactic is manifest in the series called Disjonctions, in which Moulène photographs still lives, portraits, daily urban scenes. The notion of disjunction, which can be interpreted in the grammatical sense (‘or’, ‘either… either…’) or in terms of logic (an alternative in a dilemma), is manifest in the image by the disunity of the elements in the composition. The artist is not just a photographer, he increasingly creates relations with drawing, sculpture, objects, texts and newspapers. As a counterpoint, when asked what unites his work, the artist responds that: “An absurd evidence, a horrible revelation,a burst of laughter…” (Interview with Briony Fer, « Chaque quelconque », ibidem.) His works tend towards evocation rather than fixed meaning, inviting the spectators to invent their own tales in this “community of storytellers and translators” (Jacques Rancière, The Emancipated Spectator).

When somebody “speaks,” his or her avatar is seen typing, a mechanical ticking sound is heard, and words appear as text on the screen, strengthening the feeling that the conversation is taking place inside of our head. The video creates a new relation to the body and a new form of intimacy.

Eleanor Antin,"Comprised of fifty-one photographic postcards, Antin’s 100 Boots is an epic visual narrative in which 100 black rubber boots stand in for a fictional “hero” making a “trip” from California to New York City. Over two-and-a-half years, Antin photographed the boots against different backdrops across the U.S., and then turned the pictures into postcards, which she then mailed to approximately 1,000 people around the world. In conjunction with the boots’ “arrival” in New York City, the postcards were exhibited at the Museum of Modern Art. The project speaks not only to the reproduction and dissemination of images, but also about how the material reality of the images—their settings and their existence in mailboxes—was in stark contrast to the everyday lives of the people who received the cards. As with all “mail art” which had begun with the Fluxus movement in the late 1950s and was on the rise in the late 1960s, using the postal service enabled artists to completely bypass the traditional art-world distribution system, and allowed Antin to expand or compress time as the narrative required.","Over a roughly thirty-year period, conceptual and multidisciplinary artist Eleanor Antin has been creating narrative images in photography, video, film, performance, and installation. Her practices blur fiction and history, often with humorous wit, theatrical sensibility, and allegorical impulse. During her early career, Antin was associated with a group of artists who were recognized for returning the element of narrative to contemporary art, which until the 1970s had been dominated by highly abstract, purist work.",100 Boots,Americas,"['hero.n.02', 'distribution.n.03', 'journey.n.01', 'materiality.n.02', 'bypass.v.01', 'stand-in.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/img-560.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/img-560-235x300.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/100-boots/,"Comprised of fifty-one photographic postcards, Antin’s 100 Boots is an epic visual narrative in which 100 black rubber boots stand in for a fictional “hero” making a “trip” from California to New York City.

Joe Scanlan,"Spring Line is a piece shown for the first time in his solo exhibition at the Institut d’Art Contemporain in Villeurbanne in 2007. It pays homage to the work of the famous conceptual artist Sol LeWitt, who had died on 8 April that year. Scanlan aims to guide the spectator to gage the level of influence Sol LeWitt has had on his work with regards the conversion of potential ideas into sculpture. Forsythia stems, a theme in his work of the last 7 years, are seen as concrete drawings where each stem is a line in space and each flower a mark. Taking the concept of Sol LeWitt’s instructions in which the artwork exists first as an idea before realization, Spring Line applies the same principle by which an artwork exists first of all as a mobile box prior to installation. The way in which the drawings are exhibited in space can vary: in Villeurbanne they were dispersed, during the Armory Show the stems all stayed in the box, in Amsterdam only 5 drawings were created, the other stems stayed in the box. Thus Spring Line is a variable image which is adaptable to any space and reinvented each time. The forsythia motif resonates with this idea, since it is a flower that renews itself constantly in the cycle of seasons – eternal and forever new.","Joe Scanlan became known in the 1990s due to his very particular appropriation of Conceptual art, exploiting two main registers: display on one hand, designating the artwork as a consumable product, DIY on the other, advocating the mobility and adaptability of objects, even their reversibility depending on contexts and usages. Scanlan’s work turns out to be reversible. A shelf can appear to be a minimal construction and be used as a shelf, as implied by functional logic. The technical simplicity of Scanlan’s realizations purposely leaning towards low-tech, with subsidiary possibilities for most of them to be de-installed and stored with no difficulty, convey something practical (art can be concretely useful) and aesthetic (each one of the artist’s creations carries a specific function but also has its own plastic qualities) in the work. Thus Joe Scanlan’s practice involves strategies that question the market and the value of a work of art. Extremely surprised by the attitude of students who are already wooed by galleries while they are still training, he invents Donnelle Woolford, a fictional artist he launches in the art world (with exhibitions, press articles, CV, facebook page, etc.). Beyond the conceptual aspect of his work, his approach focuses on the ephemeral nature of things, objects, lives. The artist’s recent research, into the production of snowflakes or reconstituted forsythias, reveal his constant interest in what is transitory or ephemeral.

Harun Farocki,"For Immersion, Harun Farocki went to visit a research centre near Seattle specialized in the development of virtual realities and computer simulations. One of their projects consists in using virtual reality (environments created to simulate this world) for therapeutic reasons for soldiers suffering traumas after the Iraq war. The double projection creates a parallel between animations and testimonies by soldiers reliving their mission, the explosions, gunshots and ambushes, their fears and their guilt. The chosen direct rendering and simplicity of the edit places us like the voyeur of a personal and difficult experience. The end is disconcerting since the last soldier, who one minute had been pleading his therapist to stop the program, looks at his audience and smiles with a detachment that sheds doubt on the authenticity of his account. The Virtual Iraq program is closer to a virtual game than a therapeutic program.

More specifically it is a critical and political approach to the image that has characterized his oeuvre since the start, a point of view on the connections between war, technology and capitalism. In 1969, he makes one of his first films in 16mm called Inextinguishable Fire in which he appears as a TV presenter reading out the testimony of a Vietnamese victim of a Napalm attack. The subsequent images are like an educational documentary, an austere thesis on the origins of napalm production and the involvement of workers, students and engineers in what was largely used as a weapon against civilians. Years later, for the trilogy Eye/Machine (2001-2003), Farocki collects sequences filmed during the Gulf War, like images from projectiles, juxtaposed with images produced by machines made for surveillance, recognition and localization. The art historian Hal Foster describes Farocki’s work like a genealogy of ‘visual instrumentalization’ following the evolution of image technologies and their roles in power struggles and the exercise of control. At the beginning of the 1990s he begins to imagine double projections that were presented in cinemas and soon in galleries and institutions that could easily adapt to this mode of projection.

Mathilde Rosier,"Rosier’s body of films, gleam with that indeterminate in-between glow of twilight. Things hardly move at all in her films. They are, quite simply, often without plot, without spoken voice and without narrative elements. Such is the case of Far from Honolulu (2003), a film exploring the plight of intuition and emotion inside the idea of the sea journey. In the film, a pensive and reflective man is depicted playing guitar at sea as well as from inside a boat looking outward. Airy and divine-like, he is shown sleeping, in a trance state, staring out to the ocean, waiting for the journey to pass, progress, in order to arrive somewhere, but where? There is mention of Recife, Brazil, but one gets the sense that figure and place is almost other-worldly or mythic. This is further highlighted by the repetitious sound of the ocean’s waves. The ending of the film is quite arbitrary, expressing a clear desire to not illustrate an end or a narrative, but another kind of vacant agency close to immediacy and the present.","Mathilde Rosier’s oeuvre arguably skirts the line between real and fiction. Not in the sense of plausible but fake alternative histories or but rather, hers are theatrical renderings in film, performance, painting or sculpture. The cultivation of illusion and ambiguity, as a counter to the concrete veracity of factual things, is one of Mathilde Rosier’s persistent concerns. The artworks that result seem decidedly uncontemporary; without attempting to be nostalgic per se, they appear out of our time or quaint. Pastel-colored watercolors of birds attached to hats, melodic musical scores, videos permeated with the haze of twilight: the artist would tell you that her art sits at the limit of the “acceptable,” as it is at times too charmingly pretty and too apparently inoffensive to fit in an art world that often privileges other qualities.

Inspired by new technologies in the auto manufacturing, these “Finish Fetish” artists appropriated industrial materials such as car paint or lacquer to create artwork with pristine finishes. Chicago too was interested in using industrial technologies and enrolled in auto body and boat building school. While the geometric forms, meticulously applied finish, and luminous, gradated hues of color in Domes speak to Chicago’s interest in the prevailing artistic themes of 1960s Southern California, its intimate scale, round shape, and triangular formation belie her career-long interest in using “feminine” forms to promote feminist issues.","In the 1970s Judy Chicago and Miriam Schapiro founded the Feminist Art Program at CSU Fresno, which later moved to CalArts in Los Angeles.

Qing Zhang,"603 Football Field presents a soccer game played inside a small student apartment in Shanghai. Installed like monitors fed by surveillance cameras, the videos present a voyeuristic entry into a private space, where two teams of men are scurrying around a bed, a desk, and some shelves in to score a goal, represented by a kitchen at one end and bathroom at the other. The game is furnished with complete uniforms, a referee, and a midfield line. Initially, the game appears as a whimsical solution to urban ennui. Yet, as the players shuffle the ball around, recklessly knocking down items in the apartment, the viewer begins to wonder if the indoor game marks the increase of air pollution, and the erasure of green space by real estate development has forced all leisure activity to be conducted in the prison of one’s apartment under surveillance.","Zhang Qing is a conceptual artist living and working in Shanghai after graduating from the Changzhou Institute of Technology. Zhang’s works deploy a variety of motifs and styles, at times dabbling in gender-bending photography and engaging in endurance-performances. Particularly, Zhang uses humor as an access point to expose the darker sides of capitalism in works such as Don’t Go So Fast (2009), social commentary on the state of economic disparity among social classes.

Installed like monitors fed by surveillance cameras, the videos present a voyeuristic entry into a private space, where two teams of men are scurrying around a bed, a desk, and some shelves in to score a goal, represented by a kitchen at one end and bathroom at the other. The game is furnished with complete uniforms, a referee, and a midfield line. Initially, the game appears as a whimsical solution to urban ennui. Yet, as the players shuffle the ball around, recklessly knocking down items in the apartment, the viewer begins to wonder if the indoor game marks the increase of air pollution, and the erasure of green space by real estate development has forced all leisure activity to be conducted in the prison of one’s apartment under surveillance.. Zhang Qing is a conceptual artist living and working in Shanghai after graduating from the Changzhou Institute of Technology. Zhang’s works deploy a variety of motifs and styles, at times dabbling in gender-bending photography and engaging in endurance-performances. Particularly, Zhang uses humor as an access point to expose the darker sides of capitalism in works such as Don’t Go So Fast (2009), social commentary on the state of economic disparity among social classes. His recent video installation and mixed media works has developed a sophisticated videographic language, exemplified by CCTV(2011) to address issues of state media, surveillance and privacy.

Taus Makhacheva,"For Taus Makhacheva, the wild, untamed side of human nature is often the foundation of many of her formal investigations. A leading voice of the younger generation based in Moscow, Makhacheva works with sculpture and installation while her preferred medium remains video. Her Dagestani (Northern Caucasian) roots draw her to this rugged land as her site of choice for many of her works. She digs into the cultural shifts and changes that overwhelmed this land during a state of post-soviet disorientation. While turning to a lost past, the sense of nostalgia in her work is often overcome by an urgency to invent new traditions and rituals. Tackling head on issues of assimilation, morphing customs and gender politics, her performances and video installations reveal a strong sense of human dignity and pride.  A seminal work in her long line of investigations of the Dagestani identity, the three-channel video installation Let me be part of a narrative looks at the all-male dog fighting championship set up alongside a Soviet documentary of Ali Aliev, the five-time world wrestling champion from Dagestan. Seemingly disparate at first, both games expose a need to diffuse aggression, revealing a strict code of play and conduct such as ‘not showing teeth’ or ‘not hiding the tail’.

A leading voice of the younger generation based in Moscow, Makhacheva works with sculpture and installation while her preferred medium remains video. Her Dagestani (Northern Caucasian) roots draw her to this rugged land as her site of choice for many of her works. She digs into the cultural shifts and changes that overwhelmed this land during a state of post-soviet disorientation. While turning to a lost past, the sense of nostalgia in her work is often overcome by an urgency to invent new traditions and rituals. Tackling head on issues of assimilation, morphing customs and gender politics, her performances and video installations reveal a strong sense of human dignity and pride.  A seminal work in her long line of investigations of the Dagestani identity, the three-channel video installation Let me be part of a narrative looks at the all-male dog fighting championship set up alongside a Soviet documentary of Ali Aliev, the five-time world wrestling champion from Dagestan. Seemingly disparate at first, both games expose a need to diffuse aggression, revealing a strict code of play and conduct such as ‘not showing teeth’ or ‘not hiding the tail’.

The booming art scene around Ferus gave visibility and credibility to West Coast contemporary art. Highly critical of modernism, Kienholz’s theatrical assemblages of found objects and decaying detritus often refer to current events and social issues..

Rachel Foster,"Rachel E. Foster uses printmaking, sculpture, and photography to illuminate the nearly invisible. For her source material she combs the digital world for bits of strange information that seep into our daily reality. These clues, be they coded sequences or simple phrases, become part of her puzzle; by reframing information she makes us reconsider it through a different lens. Language is embedded in Foster’s work, but it is subject to play, often becoming obscured or reoriented. In Ghost I (2009) the word “ghost” becomes ghosted, rendered ominously in white chalk on black paper so that it resembles an apparition. Average Lifespan (2009) calculates the average lifespan of eight famous poets. This seemingly random equation reveals to us the age at which the poets died and forges a posthumous relationship among them.","Rachel Foster is concerned with showing the unseen.

Foster uses printmaking, sculpture, and photography to illuminate the nearly invisible. For her source material she combs the digital world for bits of strange information that seep into our daily reality. These clues, be they coded sequences or simple phrases, become part of her puzzle; by reframing information she makes us reconsider it through a different lens. Language is embedded in Foster’s work, but it is subject to play, often becoming obscured or reoriented. In Ghost I (2009) the word “ghost” becomes ghosted, rendered ominously in white chalk on black paper so that it resembles an apparition. Average Lifespan (2009) calculates the average lifespan of eight famous poets. This seemingly random equation reveals to us the age at which the poets died and forges a posthumous relationship among them.. Rachel Foster is concerned with showing the unseen.

Pedro Reyes,"In Reyes’s words, “We should be able to extract the technological nutrients before we excrete our waste. There is a missing organ in our social metabolism which would work as a stomach or intestines. The Recyclone is a device made of plastic containers that fit into each other. (The plastic boxes are the equivalent to the ‘vellum,’ which are the tiny hairs that stick out from the intestinal wall to absorb nutrients). The permutation of this plastic bins could be customized to satisfy anyone’s recycling needs.” This work offers the possibility of a more visually appealing and adaptable recycling mechanism, assisting in the conscientious extraction of reusable material from industrial products.","Pedro Reyes’s works traverse the worlds of art, film, architecture, design, social criticism, and pedagogy. Educated as an architect, Reyes draws on this training to engage with utopian aspirations and the ongoing legacy of Modernism, often focusing on issues of scale and space while questioning pressing social issues through the incitement of individual or collective interaction. Although only a few of his works are directly located within the practice of building, almost all involve some kind of construction, whether they are objects, models, interiors, or social spaces. Reyes also makes use of strategies developed for communication or education, as well as everyday humor, to engage his audiences.

There is a missing organ in our social metabolism which would work as a stomach or intestines. The Recyclone is a device made of plastic containers that fit into each other. (The plastic boxes are the equivalent to the ‘vellum,’ which are the tiny hairs that stick out from the intestinal wall to absorb nutrients). The permutation of this plastic bins could be customized to satisfy anyone’s recycling needs.” This work offers the possibility of a more visually appealing and adaptable recycling mechanism, assisting in the conscientious extraction of reusable material from industrial products.. Pedro Reyes’s works traverse the worlds of art, film, architecture, design, social criticism, and pedagogy. Educated as an architect, Reyes draws on this training to engage with utopian aspirations and the ongoing legacy of Modernism, often focusing on issues of scale and space while questioning pressing social issues through the incitement of individual or collective interaction. Although only a few of his works are directly located within the practice of building, almost all involve some kind of construction, whether they are objects, models, interiors, or social spaces. Reyes also makes use of strategies developed for communication or education, as well as everyday humor, to engage his audiences. Many of his works either allow large-scale public engagement or suggest a possible use: weapons turned to shovels, multilevel parks in old modernist buildings, and small spherical rooms. Like many avant-garde thinkers of the past, Reyes constructs new forms of architecture necessary for new ways of life..

Abraham Cruzvillegas,"A cadence is a configuration of notes that indicates the continuation or resolution of a melody or song. In speech, a cadence has a similar function but is generally associated with a falling inflection. The triad is the most common construction of a chord.

Alain Séchas,"“To me, art equals responsibility”.  That is probably why Alain Séchas creates works according to the human scale, immediately evoking the human body.

Roman Ondak,"This work needs to be considered in relation to one of his performances during which people were made to queue in front of the Kunsthalle of Frankfurt in 2003 (Tate Collection). In this instance Ondak collected images of people queuing in front of all sorts of buildings in various newspapers. He then inserted these in a Slovakian newspaper without trying to give any coherence with the information in the text on the same page. The result is a fictional space with the potential for the invention of different scenarios. The theme of people queuing encourages the consideration of the relation between interior and exterior but also of exclusion. It can also be a reference to deprivation during periods of war or economic depression. In the manner of works by Felix Gonzales-Torres, the audience can take a copy of the newspaper which therefore leaves the exhibition space. The fact that the message or the artwork circulates is an integral part of the artistic gesture. People lining up behind one another also formally becomes a living sculpture.

Anthony McCall,"The film Line Describing a Cone was made in 1973 and it was projected for the first time at Fylkingen (Stockholm) on 30 August of the same year. This piece, which was initially screened in independent film contexts, it soon began to be shown at art museums and ended up becoming one of the key works of the artistic movement that opened up the visual arts towards cinema. With a duration of 30 minutes, the film shows the creation of a white curve being projected onto an empty space. A thin mist is introduced into the projection area, therefore the viewer can progressively see (more than a circle reflected on the wall) a large cone of light which simultaneously becomes a light sculpture into which he is invited to circulate. By allowing the viewer to immerse himself in it, and play with this strange substance, Line Describing a Cone becomes not only something made to be seen, but also something to be experienced since the viewer is absorbed into the scene and becomes part of the action. In this way, McCall recreates an inversion: by placing the public facing the projector, he reveals the entire process of kinematics and, at the same time, he destroys any possibility of illusionism, in order to create another, that of magic, poetry and wonder.","Since the 70s, the British artist Anthony McCall has continued to push the boundaries of art.

Kelley Walker,"The triptych Black Star Press is part of the series ‘The Black Star Press project’ initiated in 2004 by the American artist Kelley Walker. The images in this series are taken from a photo essay on the struggle for civil rights in Alabama, directed by Charles Moore in 1962 (and published by the magazine ‘Life’) which showed the repression of the black population and persistent inequalities in the southern United States. The title “Black Star Press” is taken from the name of the news agency where Charles Moore worked, and it refers to the young black man shot fighting for the rights of his community. Of those recovered images, scanned and screen printed, Walker poured dark chocolate, white and milk chocolate in the manner of a dripping. This symbolic gesture breaks down the documentary nature of the image and expresses heightened subjectivity of Abstract Expressionism, which opposes the action a cold mechanical representation of the image. Reactivating the potential opened up by Andy Warhol’s artistic offerings in the series ‘Race Riot’, “Black Star Press” echoes the entire tradition of image appropriation, from Pop Art and Appropriationism itself.","While the pop art movement and the appropriationist movement essentially concerned the iconography of popular media, like newspapers to TV commercials, Kelley Walker is interested in the media system as a whole. Her work frequently questions the notions of author and audience, originality and authenticity, reproduction and the circulation of images. The artist plays with the usual distribution system of the work of art.  The image contained therein can indeed be reproduced endlessly and printed in various formats according to wishes of the buyer, as exemplified in the work Shema (2003). Demonstrating that there is more ways than one to escape the rehearsal process, Untitled (2003) is a steel plate of the recycling logo superimposed over an image. For Walker, it is no longer necessary to appropriate ideas, objects, images but to recycle them: the perpetual recycling of codes and systems inherent in advertising.

Colectivo Tercerunquinto,"BF15 is a preparatory study for the collective’s intervention at the BF15 gallery in Mexico, near Monterrey. It includes a photograph, a collage, sketches and notes. The intervention consists in the seamless extension of the wall of the BF15 gallery beyond the property boundaries, invading the sidewalk and the street, entering public space. The artists highlight the permeability between public, professional and private space. Through these actions, they question the definition of those notions, and become involved in negotiations, making connections and exchanges. Interrogating the role of each space and its function is central to their work.","Tercerunquinto develops work related to the urban, the boundaries between public and private space. By introducing simple signs or gestures – the construction of a concrete slab, displacement of a portion of bitumen on the side of the road, encroachement of grass on a parking, the three artists interrogate public space as the place of possibilities. Their interventions give users an active status with the power to decide on their own environment. For the Hong Kong architecture biennale, the collective intervened in the exhibition spaces. The intervention consisted in constructing a wall which integrated the word ‘Anarchitecture’ (anarchy + architecture) by omitting certain bricks. Therefore it was as if the word had perforated the wall. Through the wall, the spectator could see the city and its transformations.

It includes a photograph, a collage, sketches and notes. The intervention consists in the seamless extension of the wall of the BF15 gallery beyond the property boundaries, invading the sidewalk and the street, entering public space. The artists highlight the permeability between public, professional and private space. Through these actions, they question the definition of those notions, and become involved in negotiations, making connections and exchanges. Interrogating the role of each space and its function is central to their work.. Tercerunquinto develops work related to the urban, the boundaries between public and private space. By introducing simple signs or gestures – the construction of a concrete slab, displacement of a portion of bitumen on the side of the road, encroachement of grass on a parking, the three artists interrogate public space as the place of possibilities. Their interventions give users an active status with the power to decide on their own environment. For the Hong Kong architecture biennale, the collective intervened in the exhibition spaces. The intervention consisted in constructing a wall which integrated the word ‘Anarchitecture’ (anarchy + architecture) by omitting certain bricks. Therefore it was as if the word had perforated the wall. Through the wall, the spectator could see the city and its transformations. Thus the spectator was invited to develop his critical outlook on the environment.The collective – formed in 1998 – is composed by Julio Castro, born in 1976, Gabriel Cazares, born in 1978, and Rolando Flores, born in 1975.

Jochen Lempert,"A Trip to the North Sea is composed of 6 parts. The images show a rough sea, with huge waves. The waves foam, swell and collapse. The large size of the images, like posters, engulf the spectator’s body, as if captured by the wave which becomes sonorous in its surge, rolling from one image to the other. The clear horizon traces a line, a continuity between each image. The waves are rendered like an all over. Their massiveness accentuates the sculptural aspect of the subject. In the printing process, the artist has recomposed the image, aligning the horizon so all aspects coincide. The process remains simple and contributes to the construction of a mental and archetypal image. The vision Lempert proposes is that of an intact and virgin world. All his work has an ephemeral, ungraspable, touching feel.","Trained as a biologist, Lempert’s subjects are nature and its inhabitants while also being very influenced by the art of his time: seriality, archiving, abstraction, all-over painting. His approach to reality is empirical. At all times one is aware of his wonder and profound amazement with the world. He records traces, the natural geometries of the world, and thus defines his place between photography, drawing, abstraction and the object. His work in subtle. This is not to do with the definition of his images, but on the contrary with their absence of clarity, the choice made between the reality of the shot and the work in the lab. A double process occurs: what is captured and becoming in the presumed images is modified by the printing. There is some sort of loss, an incomplete image. The materiality of the paper plays a role in this approximate definition introducing a poor patina, entertaining the attitude of unlearning and starting again. Therefore the question can be posed differently: making visible something that is escaping, decomposing and going elsewhere.Jochen Lempert was born in Moers, Germany, in 1958. he lives and works in Hamburg.",Un voyage en Mer du Nord ( A trip to the North Sea),Europe,"['horizon.n.01', 'pure.s.04', 'wave.n.01', 'archetypal.s.01', 'ephemeral.s.01', 'continuity.n.03']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/img-683.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/img-683-300x219.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/un-voyage-en-mer-du-nord-a-trip-to-the-north-sea/,"A Trip to the North Sea is composed of 6 parts.

The clear horizon traces a line, a continuity between each image. The waves are rendered like an all over. Their massiveness accentuates the sculptural aspect of the subject. In the printing process, the artist has recomposed the image, aligning the horizon so all aspects coincide. The process remains simple and contributes to the construction of a mental and archetypal image. The vision Lempert proposes is that of an intact and virgin world. All his work has an ephemeral, ungraspable, touching feel.. Trained as a biologist, Lempert’s subjects are nature and its inhabitants while also being very influenced by the art of his time: seriality, archiving, abstraction, all-over painting. His approach to reality is empirical. At all times one is aware of his wonder and profound amazement with the world. He records traces, the natural geometries of the world, and thus defines his place between photography, drawing, abstraction and the object. His work in subtle. This is not to do with the definition of his images, but on the contrary with their absence of clarity, the choice made between the reality of the shot and the work in the lab. A double process occurs: what is captured and becoming in the presumed images is modified by the printing. There is some sort of loss, an incomplete image. The materiality of the paper plays a role in this approximate definition introducing a poor patina, entertaining the attitude of unlearning and starting again. Therefore the question can be posed differently: making visible something that is escaping, decomposing and going elsewhere.Jochen Lempert was born in Moers, Germany, in 1958. he lives and works in Hamburg..

Bruno Serralongue,"The half-length portrait of Joe Shirley presents a man with a great presence, wearing several items that point to ancestral Native American culture. In this photograph, which is relatively poor in information, the projection screen in the background acts as a clue about the event: Bruno Serralongue went to the second phase of the ‘Sommet Mondial sur la Société de l’Information’ (or SMSI, World Summit on Information Society, in Tunis in November 2005). This portrait echoes another picture in the same series (Native Peoples Claim Their Right to Participate in the Information Society) in which Joe Shirley is just a silhouette amongst the speakers, whereas here he occupies the entire frame. The strange impression that the model is posing for press photographers – and not for an artist making a portrait – reveals the staging of the event along the lines of the ‘discourse of order’ (Michel Foucault). In addition, the painting format introduces a different reading to that of a press photo. The artist questions the point of view and the space: “What distance should be adopted to face an event ? […] In my view, when using a different tool like a photographic chamber, there is necessarily a greater distance. […] In documentary photography, there is this idea of adjusting the distance, so that one cannot see too much or too little. One needs to find a distance within which the photographed person or event can ‘speak’”.","Bruno Serralongue integrates his practice into the processes of production and distribution of information via images. He attends very diverse events such as regional festivities (Les fêtes, 1994), the universal exhibition in Hanover (Expo 2000), a neoliberal meeting in Chiapas (Encuentro, Chiapas, 1996), with a rhythm which is different to that of a press photo-journalist. With no specific accreditation and by using a camera that requires very long exposures, his standpoint is of course different. The artist questions commissions and working methods – he then integrates these as modalities for producing  images by instatinga distance between the subject and the personal stylistic signature. According to his protocol for the Faits divers series (1993- 1995), the photographer works on very allusive information extracted from t miscellaneous news item section of the ‘Nice-Matin’ newspaper; Serralongue goes to the place mentioned two days after the event. As if emptied, the images create a space for representation that did not exist before. In the context of a crisis of representation and the scripting of reality by press images, “the document is a response to the world of images on the actual territory of the images, it is perhaps the only way to oppose the monopoly of spectacle”, according to Michel Poivert (in his analysis of the documentary style in “La photographie contemporaine”,  2002), “the photographer and the spectator are reconciled by the adoption of the ordinary man’s viewpoint”.","Mr Joe Shrigley Jr, président de la nation Navajo",Europe,"['navaho.n.01', 'portraiture.n.02', 'stagy.s.01', 'pose.n.02', 'frame.v.02', 'conference.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/img-365.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/img-365-232x300.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/mr-joe-shrigley-jr-president-de-la-nation-navajo/,"The half-length portrait of Joe Shirley presents a man with a great presence, wearing several items that point to ancestral Native American culture.

Allen Ruppersberg,"Untitled (City Limits) is a series of five black-and-white photographs of road signs, specifically the signs demarcating city limits of several small towns in California. Taken outside Palmdale, Littlerock, Pearlblossom, Victorville, and Barstow, towns where the population does not exceed 20,000, Ruppersberg’s trip follows the outskirts of Los Angeles. As with many of his other photographic series, the artist here inserted into each view a constant element that disturbs the otherwise quiet scenes: a hand holding an open magazine. By pairing each road sign with magazines as diverse as Playboy, Look, Hulk comics, Arizona Highways or Rona Barrett’s Hollywood, Ruppersberg teases the viewer to find a connection between the two.","Like many of his peers in the 1960s, Allen Ruppersberg recognized art as existing not in the isolated realm of aesthetics, but as a practice with a clear political and critical potential, one inextricably immersed in an economic system. Ruppersberg took as source material diverse items stemming from a distinct American form of popular culture of the mid-twentieth century. However, it was perhaps his particular use of everyday rituals to explore different cultural mythologies and narratives that separated him from many conceptual artists of his generation. For a period between the late 1960s and early 1970s, Ruppersberg developed several series of photographs that privileged a certain kind of neutrality, stillness, and emptiness that resembled the seemingly authorless images of mass-produced postcards or calendars.

Raphaël Zarka,"This photograph seems to be awaiting meaning, it more or less evokes known elements without really identifying with them completely: a motorway interchange, a bridge, an electric pylon… In fact this is the end of the tracks of the Aérotrain, a wheelless monorail invented by Jean Bertin in the 1970s, which acts like ‘a fossil of movement on landscape scale’, as explained by the artist. This fragmentary place is meant to activate physical movement. It also activates the spectator’s imagination.  The series Les formes du repos is a photographic collection of concrete geometric objects, in undefinable spaces, set aside or in waiting. The photographic document allows the display of these ‘involuntary sculptures’. Paired down geometric forms (whether modernist or futurist) appear tensely in their decor (a field, several buildings on the horizon). This photograph is key in the series, since the tracks are no longer an object but a space. The positioning of the shot emphasises the fragmentary character, the tracks only lead to an empty decor. Observing this defunct functionality, the artist, with Vincent Lamouroux, created Pentacycle (a mono terrain vehicle, 2002) in order to reactivate movement on this ruin.","Raphaël Zarka presents himself as a sculptor and artist-collector. He scrutinises the contemporary world to draw up a genealogy of geometric forms. He is constantly noticing Plato’s polyhedrons (speculative geometric forms) materialized in concrete breakwaters (Les formes du repos series/The Forms of Rest). His work highlights the fact that the ‘survival of forms’ (Aby Warburg) takes place in today’s world in functional and concrete environments. The artist acts with the curiosity of the Renaissance humanists in their studio (Studiolo, 2008), but he has adopted a thinking structure where dichotomies and the methodological boundaries of Art History are banned. With his typical transversal approach, the artist has started theoretical research into the urban practice that is skateboard by publishing essays and realizing artistic projects. In Riding modern art  (Lyon Biennale, 2007), he confronts photographs of the skaters performing on public sculptures with a sculpture by Katarzyna Kobro. The confrontation underlines that the movement is either of aesthetic potential for modern sculpture or a mechanical realization for skating. “It’s almost an insult to the mysteries of the world to think that we could invent anything or that we needed to invent anything”; this quote by Borgès has become the artist’s motto.Raphaël Zarka was born in 1957 in Montpellier, France.

Shahzia Sikander,"The Last Post was inspired by Sikander’s ongoing interest in the colonial history of the sub-continent and the British opium trade with China. In this animation, layers of images, abstract forms, meaning, and metaphorical associations slowly unfold at the same time that more visual myths are created. The identity of the protagonist, a red-coated official, is indeterminate and suggestive of both the mercantilist policies that led to the Opium Wars with China and the cultural authority claimed by the Company school of painting over colonial India. Though situated in a particular historical context, The Last Post remains an open-ended narrative with infinite possible  interpretations. The work’s scope and complexity is expanded further by its sound element, which was created by Du Yun, an artist and composer based in New York City.","Shahzia Sikander is known for her richly layered and intricately detailed graphite, ink, and gouache paintings. She studied miniature painting in the late 1980s at the National College of Art in Lahore, Pakistan, with the forms and techniques of Indo-Persian miniatures heavily influencing her approach. Sikander’s practice explores the concepts of “East” and “West,” using traditional strategies of storytelling and themes of popular mythology to deconstruct the postcolonial legacy of the Indo-Persian region. In 2001, Sikander began to employ digital animation to create video works based on her drawings. Her practice traverses painting, drawing, animation, installation, and video, to radically rearticulate the tradition of miniature painting. Sikhander uses the technique to address contemporary issues, including the Western fear of Islam, the globalization of Western ways of living, and gender identity, focusing specifically on Muslim women in the West.

The identity of the protagonist, a red-coated official, is indeterminate and suggestive of both the mercantilist policies that led to the Opium Wars with China and the cultural authority claimed by the Company school of painting over colonial India. Though situated in a particular historical context, The Last Post remains an open-ended narrative with infinite possible  interpretations. The work’s scope and complexity is expanded further by its sound element, which was created by Du Yun, an artist and composer based in New York City.. Shahzia Sikander is known for her richly layered and intricately detailed graphite, ink, and gouache paintings. She studied miniature painting in the late 1980s at the National College of Art in Lahore, Pakistan, with the forms and techniques of Indo-Persian miniatures heavily influencing her approach. Sikander’s practice explores the concepts of “East” and “West,” using traditional strategies of storytelling and themes of popular mythology to deconstruct the postcolonial legacy of the Indo-Persian region. In 2001, Sikander began to employ digital animation to create video works based on her drawings. Her practice traverses painting, drawing, animation, installation, and video, to radically rearticulate the tradition of miniature painting. Sikhander uses the technique to address contemporary issues, including the Western fear of Islam, the globalization of Western ways of living, and gender identity, focusing specifically on Muslim women in the West. The artist’s use of a traditional and scholarly approach to discuss the conflicts in the global condition creates a unique oeuvre–the digital animations, breathing new life into Mughal-era miniature painting..

Eric Baudelaire,"In a society saturated by images, Eric Baudelaire is interested in political events that have not found their representation.  For the film The Anabasis of May and Fusako Shigenobu, Masao Adachi and 27 Years without Images, Baudelaire conducted research on 1970s Japanese cinema and more specifically on Wakamatsu and Masao Adachi’s filmography. In 1971, as the two legendary filmmakers of Japanese Nouvelle Vague were on their way home from a presentation at the Cannes festival, they stopped in Beirut, where their thinking concerning the image took the form of political activism. They made a documentary on the Palestinian struggle. Three years later, Masao Adachi became the writer for the Japanese Red Army Faction, which was linked to the PFLP (Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine).  In this film, the 30 year-long journey of the Japanese Red Army is told by two of its protagonists. As the daughter of the founder of the group, May Shigenobu was a close witness. She was born in hiding in Lebanon and only experienced being in Japan from the age of 27, after the arrest of her mother. Adachi was the theorist of fûkeiron, themovement of filmmakers who shot landscape in order to reveal the omnipresent structures of power. There are no images of his 27 years of voluntary exile since what he filmed in Lebanon was destroyed during the war on three occasions. Therefore The Anabasis of May and Fusako Shigenobu, Masao Adachi and 27 Years without Images is structured through speech, witness accounts and memory (or false memories). The stories are intertwined and reveal complex rapports between militancy, terrorism and cinema.  Thus one wonders whether, once Adachi sided with the armed struggle, he might have continued to think like a director, planning the airplane highjacking or hostage-taking as scripts where actors would be the militants and where television cameras replaced those of the filmmaker.  More broadly, this film considers the role of art and the powerlessness that could lead to the shift from an artistic practice to armed struggle. It follows the shift from a cinematographic image to that of propaganda, and armed propaganda, before concentrating on the reconstruction of missing images.","Eric Baudelaire (b. 1973, Salt Lake City, Utah, United States), currently based in Paris, has developed an oeuvre primarily composed of film, but includes photography, silkscreen prints, performance, publications and installations. In his research-based practice, the artist examines the relationship between images, past events and their documentation. Interested in the role of the cinematographic image as an index marker, Baudelaire creates narratives in which recorded facts serve as a starting point for an exploration of the unknown. In examining the changes in human behavior though interrogating the great political structures that govern the global, national and micro-communities, Baudelaire’s practice could be read through a bio-political perspective. Navigating the experience of urban living, the global, technical and economic dependencies of war, movement and the contemporary paradigm of geographical proximity and distance, Baudelaire’s practice evokes a hauntingly provocative perspective on the current political climate.","The Anabasis of May and Fusako Shigenobu, Masao Adachi, and 27 Years without Images.",Europe,"['reconstruction.n.03', 'undepicted.s.01', 'activism.n.01', 'memory.n.02', 'testimony.n.02', 'absence.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/lanabase_eric_baudelaire.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/lanabase_eric_baudelaire-300x223.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/the-anabasis-of-may-and-fusako-shigenobu-masao-adachi-and-27-years-without-images/,"In a society saturated by images, Eric Baudelaire is interested in political events that have not found their representation.

It follows the shift from a cinematographic image to that of propaganda, and armed propaganda, before concentrating on the reconstruction of missing images.. Eric Baudelaire (b. 1973, Salt Lake City, Utah, United States), currently based in Paris, has developed an oeuvre primarily composed of film, but includes photography, silkscreen prints, performance, publications and installations. In his research-based practice, the artist examines the relationship between images, past events and their documentation. Interested in the role of the cinematographic image as an index marker, Baudelaire creates narratives in which recorded facts serve as a starting point for an exploration of the unknown. In examining the changes in human behavior though interrogating the great political structures that govern the global, national and micro-communities, Baudelaire’s practice could be read through a bio-political perspective. Navigating the experience of urban living, the global, technical and economic dependencies of war, movement and the contemporary paradigm of geographical proximity and distance, Baudelaire’s practice evokes a hauntingly provocative perspective on the current political climate..

Charles Avery,"Since 2005, Charles Avery has devoted his practice to the perpetual description of a fictional island. Replete with its own population and constantly shifting topography, Avery’s intricately conceived project amounts to an ever-expanding body of drawings, sculptures, installations and texts which evince the island. Exhibited incrementally these heterogeneous elements serve as terms within the unifying structure of the island – as multiple emissions of an imaginary state, and as a meditation on the central themes of philosophy and the problems of art-making. The ultimate destination of Avery’s epic venture is the documentation of this ‘heterotopia’ in a book of many volumes. Avery is one of a number of artists who have promoted a return to narrative. The Kadist Foundation Collection also owns a fictive map by Avery.  This drawing is a medium-sized work in which Avery depicts an event taking place on the island close to the Labour Exchange down by the port. In essence he depicts a dance-off between waiters and itinerant workers who are looking for work on the island. The idea comes from his own experience as a 16 year-old in Italy where he met a Spaniard who had danced his way from Spain to Italy, earning money in the street by doing so. Avery teamed up with him and became the hat carrier, money collector. Avery sees this kind of drawing as a companion to the large architectural views that show the principal buildings on the island and distant views of people. It is as though he is zooming in on a particular incident caught at the edge of a camera lens. The island is of course fictional but it is nevertheless a credible place, a little like Second Life, where characters act out their lives. In fact people are beginning to use the scenarios in their teaching work as though they were real and exemplary of certain true life situations. If there is a fantastical element at all it is redolent of Jabberwocky, Lewis Carroll’s celebrated poem, which has been an important text for Avery. Avery is creating a world which could well be a place on this planet, an island off the coast of his native Scotland, for example, which can be visited by tourists (essentially the role of the viewer) or by those who want to stay there indefinitely (the role of the characters in the drawings).","Charles Avery was born in 1973 in Oban, Isle of Mull, Scotland.

LaToya Ruby Frazier,"LaToya Ruby Frazier is an artist and a militant; her photos combine intimate views of her relation with her parents and grandparents with the history of the Afro-American community of Braddock, Pennsylvania, where she grew up and where her family still live.  She reports upon the decline of this steel-producing town, which was once prosperous and where the local population today is devastated by poverty, unemployment and health problems linked to pollution.  The town has currently closed the hospital which increases unemployment and makes access to treatment complicated for the residents of one of the most polluted towns in the USA.  Through this documentary work with ties to the intimate, she goes beyond the basic information to touch upon the human consequences of these tragedies.  Frazier’s images are embedded in the history of the United States of America and they highlight what is unspoken in the social landscape. Her work is focused on the tragedy of Braddock, a town hit by a slow decay and increasing poverty (steel factories closing, crack epidemic, community debacle, disappearance of shops and urban equipment).  The captioned photographs of protests and advertising are printed with a textured effect, burnt-looking, recalling the “Rusty Belt” nickname for the steel factories of this region.  The portfolio reports on a new wave of devastation, that of a workers’ culture in the process of disappearing.  In 2009, the Levi’s brand chose the town as the backdrop of its new advertising campaign, focusing on the figure of the “new pioneer”.  Frazier mixes photographs of this campaign with others of the town and its protests against the closure and destruction of the hospital in a form of critique of the utilization of this town and its population by Levi’s.  The juxtaposition of these images documents and denounces the violent and jarring economic ambiguity of the commercial dynamic that feeds off a tragedy and a decrepit context. The proceeds of the sale of these artworks will go to the activist groups fighting for the reconstruction of the hospital.","LaToya Ruby Frazier was born in 1982 in Braddock, Pennsylvania (USA).

The series was made on the occasion of her exhibition there in 2011. In 2000, Harald Szeemann curated an exhibition at Zacheta called ‘Beware of Exiting your Dreams: You May Find Yourself in Somebody Else’s.’ The exhibition provoked a violent response as a result of his inclusion of Maurizio Cattelan’s La nona ora, where the figure of the Pope is struck down by a meteor. The work was vandalized by an MP; Anda Rottenberg, the director of the museum received a stream of abusive letters, many of them anti-semitic. Rottenberg organized a series of shows that were regarded by right wing Poles as scandalous and eventually she was forced to leave her post in 2001. In Anti-Collage, Rottenberg, depicted at a ceremony celebrating the centenary of Zacheta at the Presidential Palace, has been silhouetted out of the image. The void represents not only a dark period of Polish cultural history but also reflects upon the way in which history is rewritten in fascistic societies, particularly in former Soviet-style countries where inconvenient memories are erased. Ironically of course she stands between two Polish flags. After destroying Cattelan’s work, the MP, Witold Tomczak, wrote to the Prime Minister not only demanding Rottenberg’s dismissal but also suggesting she should curate in Israel rather than in Poland. Macuga’s image is a timely reminder of cultural vandalism and censorship as well anti-semitism in Poland, alongside the work of Yael Bartana.","She works with archival materials she finds in libraries and museums.

Sriwhana Spong,"Inspired by the 1934 novella Duo by the French writer Colette, Spong’s film Beach Study (2012)explores ideas of disappearance and the ephemeral, both physically and psychologically. In the film, a female body conducts abstract dance movements on a beach, responding to the environment that surrounds her. This particular beach was one the artist loved as a child, but today it is hardly accessible because it is in the hands of a private landowner. Shot on 16-millimeter film through colored filters, the film has intense flashes of magenta, violet, and amber, and other flickering “light leak” effects. The female body appears and disappears intermittently, creating a surreal and mysterious presence. The overall effect suggests a precarious relationship between memory and experience, transience and monumentality.","Sriwhana Spong, who lives and works in Auckland, New Zealand, is interested in notions of transition, memory, and translation.

In the film, a female body conducts abstract dance movements on a beach, responding to the environment that surrounds her. This particular beach was one the artist loved as a child, but today it is hardly accessible because it is in the hands of a private landowner. Shot on 16-millimeter film through colored filters, the film has intense flashes of magenta, violet, and amber, and other flickering “light leak” effects. The female body appears and disappears intermittently, creating a surreal and mysterious presence. The overall effect suggests a precarious relationship between memory and experience, transience and monumentality..

Adrien Missika,"Adrien Missika follows in the footsteps of the Brazilian landscape architect and artist Roberto Burle Marx (1909-1994), a designer of gardens, parks and promenades  who introduced modern landscape architecture to Brazil. Marx’s work is characterized by the use of native tropical vegetation as a structural element of design. He worked with Oscar Niemeyer and Lucio Costa, the architects of Brazilia, and with them, the tropical plant became a motif in urban architecture. His garden in Guaratiba or the Copacabana mosaic walk in Rio, are some of his well-known interventions.  Like the Brazilian landscape architect and artist Roberto Burle Marx who, sensitive to the temporal and ephemeral nature of architecture and civilizations, readily recycled architectural elements for his creations, Adrien Missika recovered the windows of a 60s Geneva building to be demolished and used them in a new context.

Pablo Pijnappel,"In Felicitas, we follow the converging routes of three characters: Felicitas, Michael and Andrew (the artist’s father-in-law who also features elsewhere). Felicitas is thedaughter of a German industrialist who immigrated to Rio after the Second World War. She is the one visible with a toucan in several images. In his work, Pablo Pijnappel privileges pre-existing images – the slides presented here are photographs found in his family archives or from other sources (media, photographs of film sets…). Sometimes, the same image is used several times with a different caption, thus encapsulating other meanings. Presented in the form of an installation with three synchronized slide projectors, Felicitas offers a complex scenario, where text and images can simultaneously be descriptive, intermingled or completely autonomous. Disjunctions and repetitions create the pace: the captioned images appear one after the other, with no regular order, sometimes on the left, in the centre or on the right. Even though the story follows a certain chronology, it is not linear and looks more like a complex collage of images and anecdotes which overlap. The text does not illustrate the images but functions as a complement that allows for the creation of multiple readings of the characters, of their lives, their trips and encounters. These collages are a mixture of real and fictional stories that enable Pijnappel to play with the notion of the documentary.

A performer acts as a traditional museum guide and offers visitors a guided tour that comments on several controversial works from art and film history like “Cosmococa” by Oiticica, “Kunst Kick “by Chris Burden, “The Society of Spectacle” by Guy Debord.  In the script of the tour guide, Garcia makes connections between these works and various authors whose approach was to question the position of the viewer and the artist within the institution. Included in the work are annotated framed index cards originating from the performance in Sydney.  The printed text includes text written entirely by Dora Garcia, while the annotations stem from the performer, who clarifies or contradicts the discourse of the artist and uses it for his tour. The framed photograph documents the performance. Garcia never carries out personal performances, rather, she commissions professional actors. Being in relative distance to the viewer, she establishes a distinct relationship between performer and audience.

Lars Laumann,"Eija Riitta was born in 1954 in Liden, Sweden, and is “objectum-sexual.” Since June 17, 1979, her name is Eija Riitta Berliner Mauer taking the name of her husband, the Berlin Wall. In animism all elements of nature are considered as alive and have souls.  “Objectum-sexuality” is an extension of this belief. Eija’s blog explains the situation perfectly – her attraction to rectangular parallel lines, constructions such as bridges, fences or the Berlin Wall. Furthermore, this can be witnessed at her house, now the “Museum of models and guillotines,” a subject that she is equally passionate about. More than a documentary on the subject, Lars Laumann filmed the encounter between two lovers of the Berlin Wall. In the video, we come to realize that the first woman married the wall before the war, clinging to the memory of what it was, while the second fell in love with the Berlin Wall after its destruction. Surprisingly, these women do not consider the wall as a symbol of political history, but more as an independent object of history. The first woman fell love with the wall for its lines, its strength, its breadth, while the other for its colors, its fragmentation, and its fragility. In presenting this film in an artistic context, Laumann makes a surprising parallel between “objectum-sexuality” and art. To contemplate a work for its formal aspects, refers to Eija’s speech which considers the Berlin Wall as a free being, without any responsibility of which he is charged. Thus, the destruction of the wall, as Eija claims, is as an act of barbarism, of an innocent person.","The films of Lars Laumann incorporate codes of documentary, grappling with topics at the limits of fiction. This process of fictional documentary recalls the practices some artists in the Kadist collection like Omer Fast, Joachim Koester, John Menick, Akram Zaatari, Arthur Zmijewski. In 2007, Matthew Higgs presented, at White Columns Gallery (New York), Laumann’s first film, “Morrissey Foretelling the Death of Diana” which claims that the Smiths album “Queen is Dead” produced in 1986, announces the death of Princess Diana in 1997 in Paris. Illustrated in a film montage, the narrator’s discourse draws parallels between the surprising words belonging to pop culture and events that occurred years later. Lars Laumann’s analysis takes as a starting point the iconic figure of Diana, and develops a “conspiracy theory” by claiming extraterrestrial involvement in those events, thus offering a vision of a world entirely controlled. Lars Laumann was born in 1975 in Brønnøysund, Norway.

In animism all elements of nature are considered as alive and have souls.  “Objectum-sexuality” is an extension of this belief. Eija’s blog explains the situation perfectly – her attraction to rectangular parallel lines, constructions such as bridges, fences or the Berlin Wall. Furthermore, this can be witnessed at her house, now the “Museum of models and guillotines,” a subject that she is equally passionate about. More than a documentary on the subject, Lars Laumann filmed the encounter between two lovers of the Berlin Wall. In the video, we come to realize that the first woman married the wall before the war, clinging to the memory of what it was, while the second fell in love with the Berlin Wall after its destruction. Surprisingly, these women do not consider the wall as a symbol of political history, but more as an independent object of history. The first woman fell love with the wall for its lines, its strength, its breadth, while the other for its colors, its fragmentation, and its fragility. In presenting this film in an artistic context, Laumann makes a surprising parallel between “objectum-sexuality” and art. To contemplate a work for its formal aspects, refers to Eija’s speech which considers the Berlin Wall as a free being, without any responsibility of which he is charged. Thus, the destruction of the wall, as Eija claims, is as an act of barbarism, of an innocent person.. The films of Lars Laumann incorporate codes of documentary, grappling with topics at the limits of fiction. This process of fictional documentary recalls the practices some artists in the Kadist collection like Omer Fast, Joachim Koester, John Menick, Akram Zaatari, Arthur Zmijewski.

Maaike Schoorel,"This is one of the most important works Schoorel has made to date, a triptych that has as its subject matter a garden scene with what looks like a pond. One of her largest works, it seems highly suited to a Parisian collection where Monet’s Nympheas in the Orangerie represent the summit of treatments of such subjects. Typically for Schoorel, the painting is as much about absence as presence and examines the amount of information the viewer needs to construct meaning. Delicate stains and touches of paint describe the subject which is contingent and evanescent. These are paintings that require slow readings, allowing the eye to adjust and to assemble information. Time is an important theme in the work; not simply the time it takes to decipher it but time associated with memory, a faculty the painting appears to emblematize. Like all Schoorel’s work, the painting is based on a photograph and therefore a scene she experienced. The temporality of the work is not that of the camera from which the image is derived, but that of painting itself. The Garden was shown in “Visible Invisible : Against the Security of the Real” at Parasol Unit, London from November 2009 to February 2010.","Based on photographs and domestic environments, Schoorel’s paintings are charged with an atmosphere of melancholy and loss. In her paintings images emerge slowly. Her figurative paintings appear faded or bleached with brush strokes that suggest outlines and restrained marks that imply areas of colour or shadow. The viewer must participate in the paintings, employing a particular way of looking that allows the images to unravel slowly over time.

Daria Martin,"Soft Materials is a curious, touching but also disturbing sequence of confrontations between two people: a man and a woman, and machines.

Each of the protagonists, whether human or mechanical, are vulnerable and naked –the humans stripped of clothing and the machines lacking protective covering.

The film evokes a history of modernist aspiration for utopia where man and machine would become bedfellows or at least entirely complimentary. The machines learn to think and act like humans echoing their appearance and actions. The work references both American body performance art of the 1960s and 1970s as well as Robert Morris’s work “Neoclassic” in which a naked dancer was filmed interacting with his sculptures at the Tate Gallery in 1971 in a series of peaceful, trancelike actions.","A number of Daria Martin’s films explore the relationship between humans and machines and make reference to modernist art, whether through the work of the Bauhuas (Schlemmer), Surrealism (Giacometti’s Palace at 4 AM) or American art of the 1960s and 1970s.

Julius Koller,"Anti-Happening refers to Koller’s 1965 manifesto, ‘Anti-Happening (System of Subjective Objectivity)’. In opposition to the notion of a ‘happening’ as a way of actualising group identity, in his manifesto, Koller stated that his concept of the ‘anti-happening’ aimed at a ‘cultural reshaping of the subject, at awareness, at the surroundings and the real world’ [i]. Unlike happenings, these actions do not involve the staging of psychologically expressive performances.  As the art historian Piotr Petrowski has noted, it is part of ‘an attitude that aims to erase the boundaries between different art tendencies (art and anti-art, modernist and neo-avant-garde painting), between different forms of neo-avant-garde practice (performance, conceptual art, Fluxus) and, above all, between art and life’[ii].

Yet Koller is not only a seminal figure in the history of the neo- and post-avant-garde; his work has long been a critical inspiration for artists and intellectuals. In the most recent past, Koller’s concepts of the Anti-Happening, the Anti-Picture, the Universal-cultural Futurological Operation (U.F.O.), his actions, objects, texts and the enormous referential archive he built up, have attracted growing interest on the part of a broader art public.  From around 1960, in response to the modernist mainstream in Slovak art, Julius Koller began to develop his aesthetic position of the “antihappening.” His strategy consists in using real objects and everyday life as the predefined program for an aesthetic operation: from 1965, in texts rubberstamped on paper that refer to the context of the “anti-happening,” and then in 1967/1968 in pictures for which Koller used white latex paint instead of oils and which saw the first appearance of the question mark—the symbol of Koller’s brands of naming, or “making known,” that was later to undergo many mutations in various media and states of aggregation. The “invitation cards for an idea”—as Koller called the text works relating to the “anti-happenings”—and the palimpsests and serial arrangements of the “anti-pictures” set themselves apart from the academicism of Modernism in more than just formal terms. Koller foregoes every form of technical mastery.

Pascal Grandmaison,"Solo (2003) is a video exhibited as a video/sound installation depicting shots of drum, voice, guitar, clavier/synthesizer, and a melodica player cut into segmented fragments from the perspective of a studio recording set. Rather than deploying a narrative strategy, Grandmaison focuses on the gestures of the musicians and the repetitions they carry out when recording their individual tracks. The musicians are portrayed nodding, dancing, improvising, strumming, creating resonance that is repeated over and over– however, Grandmaison is sure not to document their entire faces or expressions while they perform, just details. Similar to that of a “jam,” close attention is granted to the exertion of the camera and how it portrays the framing of sequences. What one can pick up from the segments, especially those of voice recording, is a modified reworking of Anne Clark’s 1980’s track “Sleeper in the Metropolis.”","Marked by an apparent austerity and meticulousness, Pascal Grandmaison’s works display a disconcerting aloofness from the world, a clearly asserted detachment from reality. The subjects that interest the artist primarily deal with the means by which humans try to grasp their world, both visually and intellectually. The artist employs photography, video, and sculpture in order to compose a vision of what some have termed “troubling strangeness.” Overturning conventional codes of visual analysis, Grandmaison focuses on inanimate subjects that, once disassociated from their familiar environment, are re-contextualized through his cold gaze. His depictions do not exist as stories instead he reverses viewpoints and inverts color codes. His photographs and video works are generally black and white, giving them a monotone feel. A constant visual repetition in his work is his rigorously impersonal gaze. As a keen observer, he meticulously scrutinizes the world around him, analyzing it through the lens of a camera. Grandmaison is interested in the appearance of things and non-beings and, more rarely, of beings themselves.

Rather than deploying a narrative strategy, Grandmaison focuses on the gestures of the musicians and the repetitions they carry out when recording their individual tracks. The musicians are portrayed nodding, dancing, improvising, strumming, creating resonance that is repeated over and over– however, Grandmaison is sure not to document their entire faces or expressions while they perform, just details. Similar to that of a “jam,” close attention is granted to the exertion of the camera and how it portrays the framing of sequences. What one can pick up from the segments, especially those of voice recording, is a modified reworking of Anne Clark’s 1980’s track “Sleeper in the Metropolis.”. Marked by an apparent austerity and meticulousness, Pascal Grandmaison’s works display a disconcerting aloofness from the world, a clearly asserted detachment from reality.

Vidya Gastaldon,"Gastaldon has made a number of soft sculptures using materials associated with knitting and sewing that have alternately fetishistic, nightmarish or contemplative qualities. “Floating Mountain” is one of a group of works made from wool that overtly depict mountain forms. Suspended from the ceiling, the sculpture floats just above the floor. In the form of a mountain with a colored top, the sculpture recalls images of Mount Fuji, normally shrouded in snow, and memorialized in countless Japanese woodcuts. Mount Hemo, however, after which the work is named, was famously climbed by King Philip V of Macedonia, a feat that was alluded to by Petrarch in his own ascent of Mont Ventoux. Philip was a warrior king who fought the Romans and allied himself with Hannibal. The obvious link with the form of a mountain is complemented by the visual affinity of the work with a costume, possibly a bridal gown with its delicate filigree. The softness of the form and texture recalls the body. The presence of blood red suggests a carnal reading, the passage from innocence and virginity to knowledge and experience. The work thus unites landscape, sexuality and femininity within a single form whose delicacy and lightness suggests something dreamlike and ephemeral. The work is made via knitted yarn; has a makeshift feel in the sense of improvisation, although Gastaldon is an artist for whom craftsmanship is of great importance. Its craft also suggests the flow of liquid as one color bleeds into another. The linear construction of the object links it to the drawings that the artist makes of fantastical landscapes.","Vidya Gastaldon creates microcosms of hallucinatory, saccharine symbols with her sculptures, drawings, video animations, and prints. Working with mediums traditionally associated with feminine labor, such as knitting, sewing, and crocheting, Gastaldon continues the tradition of feminist trailblazers like Judy Chicago, Mary Kelly, and Rosemarie Trockel, but consciously avoids overt political statements.

In her sculptures, yarn and thread form mountainous cones and internal organs, while her drawings depict mystical creatures with exaggerated smiley faces that morph into fantastical landscapes.

Tomoko Yoneda,"Yoneda’s Japanese House (2010) series of photographs depicts buildings constructed in Taiwan during the period of Japanese occupation, between 1895 and 1945. Yoneda focuses both on the original Japanese features of the houses and on details that have been altered since the end of the occupation. The yet-to-be acknowledged history of the occupation of Taiwan and other East Asian countries by Japan during World War II is subtly disclosed in these pictures. Instead of presenting monuments, the artist chooses to depict houses where the domestic lives of local Taiwanese are still unfolding today. The complexity of history is thus foregrounded by the overlapping of the everyday, the memory mixing with the remains. Former Residence of the Daughter of the Japanese Prime Minister, Kentaro Suzuki, Who Accepted the Potsdam Declaration and Full Surrender to the Allied Powers, Ending the Second World War, Qingtian Street, I depicts a dusty room with Japanese window frames but no views. Its title offers a biography of the original inhabitants and their historical role before the postwar Chinese Nationalist takeover. The wall behind the counter in Former House of General Wang Shu-ming, the Chief of Staff Under Chiang Kai-Shek, Cidong Street, I has been painted a deep red. The detailed title subtly suggests how local residents may have subsequently altered the home’s original paint colors to be more “Chinese.”","Photography is Tomoko Yoneda’s primary medium. Influenced by both journalism and archaeology, the London-based artist tries to minimize subjectivity in her work and keep her subjects as real and open as possible, leaving space for interpretation by the viewer.

Yoneda focuses both on the original Japanese features of the houses and on details that have been altered since the end of the occupation. The yet-to-be acknowledged history of the occupation of Taiwan and other East Asian countries by Japan during World War II is subtly disclosed in these pictures. Instead of presenting monuments, the artist chooses to depict houses where the domestic lives of local Taiwanese are still unfolding today. The complexity of history is thus foregrounded by the overlapping of the everyday, the memory mixing with the remains. Former Residence of the Daughter of the Japanese Prime Minister, Kentaro Suzuki, Who Accepted the Potsdam Declaration and Full Surrender to the Allied Powers, Ending the Second World War, Qingtian Street, I depicts a dusty room with Japanese window frames but no views. Its title offers a biography of the original inhabitants and their historical role before the postwar Chinese Nationalist takeover. The wall behind the counter in Former House of General Wang Shu-ming, the Chief of Staff Under Chiang Kai-Shek, Cidong Street, I has been painted a deep red. The detailed title subtly suggests how local residents may have subsequently altered the home’s original paint colors to be more “Chinese.”. Photography is Tomoko Yoneda’s primary medium. Influenced by both journalism and archaeology, the London-based artist tries to minimize subjectivity in her work and keep her subjects as real and open as possible, leaving space for interpretation by the viewer. Often the sites she documents appears insignificant and nondescript, lacking any visual references that might trigger direct associations with historical events. Their lengthy titles, however, reveal the identities of the places by providing historical and political context. The haunted feeling generated by the emptiness of the locations evokes unsettled spirits of the past, and seems to invite a moment’s reflection..

Sun used this episode—which was not fully recognized by the scientific community—as a point of departure for his depiction of a dystopian world in which the narration of history and notion of time are interrupted.

Jonas Staal,"Jonas Staal’s installation is based on the thesis written by Fleur Agema and titled “Closed Architecture”. The paper, written by the second most important person of Geert Wilderds’ Freedom Party, concerns an ambitious model for a new prison that focuses on the reconditioning of prisoners by means of four phases. Staal’s work is developed through a book, a plan and a 3d virtual tour in the social imagery of a current minister of the State of the Netherlands. Through this meticulous work by the artist the perspectives on political and architectural planning of a new right wing populist class of politicians is revealed and exposed through an analytic display.  As Jonas Staal points out: “This change in society requires more prisons since the entire society has become a model of detention: everyone is trapped in their own social conditions, whether poor or rich. Within the the debate on the representation of society and the society of control the work of Agema should be considered as a case study compared to the possibility of an open and democratic society, in which the interest common and political emancipation take center stage.”  For Staal, this model can be considered an ideological model in relation to how the Dutch society is now developing, with poor suburbs and gated communities under surveillance.","Jonas Staal ‘s work includes interventions in public spaces, exhibitions, lectures and publications.

Goldin+Senneby,"In this installation, you are standing at the heart of a bicephalous space reflecting Goldin+Senneby’s main research led during their residency in Paris. Here, two historical events from the late 1930’s and early 50’s are confronted.  In one of these spaces, you find yourself reading a map of the Marly forest where Georges Bataille’s secret society, « Acéphale », was meeting around 1937 and notably celebrating Louis XVI’s regicide.  A few years later, Georges Bataille wrote La Part maudite (1949). In this essay on economy, he describes a society of abundance and eternal excess where in return potlatch techniques and sacrifice were necessary forms of luxurious consumption.  Nearly at the same time, in the early 1950’s at the very beginning of the Cold War, you are witnessing the emergence of Eurodollar, when Soviet and Chinese banks deposited dollars in Europe, in Paris at the BCEN (EUROBANK), known today as VTB Bank. Thus, the Dollar escaped the US financial, territorial jurisdiction and the very nature of money changed from a symbolic value to  a virtual one. Money entered a new space of exteriority, beyond the control of the sovereign state.  Money was decapitated.  These are facts. Facts that are deeply entangled in a fictional narrative entitled Looking for Headless,  commissioned by artist duo Goldin+Senneby since 2007. In this detective story, involving a murder (by decapitation again), the narrator travels to the Bahamas looking for the offshore company called ‘Headless Ltd’. Looking for Headless is published as a ghost written serial novel based on raw material sent by the artists correspondences, dossiers, tapes – and by the different artistic presentations of the project since 2007 in the form of conferences, lectures, videos or exhibitions.  At the Kadist Art Foundation, Goldin+Senneby underline a tenuous but precise speculation: Is the emergence of the Eurodollar and the later offshore finance the exact void where money disappeared, performing a contemporary radical consumption announced by Bataille in La Part maudite?  And if so, can ‘Headless Ltd’ be a contemporary incarnation of Bataille’s secret society of the same  name, « Acéphale »? Are they just mere coincidences?

Amie Siegel,"Berlin Remake (2005) combines extracts of East German films with images filmed by the artist in Berlin.

Therefore on one screen there is Berlin between 1945 and 1989 and on the other Berlin in 2004. The contrast between the two is troubling, strange and uncanny (Freud would say unheimlich). History in both continuous and ruptured. It is as if the artist was remaking these films but without the actors, or the plot; in a way it is a meditation on absence as well as a demonstration of the changes in Berlin. She also uses an extract of the last film to be shot under the Communist regime. The scene occurs in a place that has been entirely reconstructed since. At the beginning, the film itself looks like a remake of an old East German film but during the projection it transpires more like a comparison rather than a reconstruction.

Cao Fei,"Diversionist is part of the Cosplayers Series from 2004. In Cosplayers Cao Fei depicts the popularity among Asian youths of “cosplay” in which daily life is merged with images of video games and popular films. For many, this virtual reality is an outlet to “transcend” the paradox of a developing society in which the pleasures of consumption and depression of alienation go hand-in-hand. Cao Fei sensitively captures the new social consciousness and activism, beautifully translating them into photographic and video works.","Cao Fei is a celebrated multimedia artist known for works that focus on the interplay between real and fictional worlds. Working across photography, performance, video, and digital media, her practice vividly reflects the zeitgeist of the late twentieth century and the role that image production has played in shaping youth culture in a digital era. Influenced by an array of forms of global pop culture—from Cantonese Pop and Japanese anime to American hip-hop—a common thread in her practice is the merging of everyday life with new forms of technology as a means to unveil society’s unfulfilled desires.  Her pivotal film Whose Utopia, for example, showcases assembly line workers in a factory in China as they act out their aspirations in a backdrop of industrial machinery. In another key body of work, RMB City, Fei created a virtual city through the platform Second Life—an online space that mimics ‘the real world’—as a vehicle to express ideas that relate to modernization, capitalism, and consumer culture. Through these constructed worlds, Fei presents a profound meditation on the boundaries between the real and the fantastic and the sense of alienation that drives new generations to increasingly experience the world behind the veneer of their Avatars.

Hamra Abbas,"At first glance, Cityscapes (2010) seems to be a collection of panoramic photographs of the city of Istanbul—the kind that are found on postcards in souvenir shops. A closer examination, however, reveals that a key element—the minaret—has been systematically removed, thereby changing profoundly the history and religious character of the city. The work is a response to a November 2009 referendum in Switzerland that approved a ban on the construction of new minarets in that country. It was also a crucial time in Turkey’s negotiation for entrance into the European Union. Instead of making a direct, didactic comment on the controversy, however, Abbas offers up a clever question regarding how landmarks are interpreted in vastly different ways depending on their cultural context.

Ybarra is not only a multifaceted artist, but also works as an educator, gallerist, activist, and social anthropologist..

Natasha Wheat,"Natasha Wheat’s Kerosene Triptych (2011) is composed of three images, one each from the digital files of the Library of Congress, the Smithsonian Institution, and the Field Museum tropical research archive. The original photographs were taken by anonymous photographers, not as art but as documents of the building of the Panama Canal.  The laborers in the images are holding cans of kerosene and spraying it into the foliage. It was a common practice during the building of the canal for American companies and the military to import black workers from the Antilles Islands to spray kerosene to kill mosquitoes and prevent malaria. This practice resulted in massive health problems for the laborers and the disappearance of many species of local wildlife—not just insects but also plants and animals. With this work, Wheat uncovers and generates a space where the movement of objects (the movement of objects being the function of the Panama Canal) takes priority over life, art, and society itself.

Each tableau vivant that the camera/viewer encounters recalls some other cultural manifestation: Greek theatre in the mask, Magritte perhaps in the woman with no face, Caspar David Friedrich in the woman gazing out of the window, Greuze in the death scene observed by spectators (but also perhaps 19 century medical demonstrations to students) etc. Many of these motifs recur in von Brandenburg’s work so there is also a sense of self-reference.

Anri Sala,"Ghost Games, follows the enigmatic dance of crabs “steered” by a flashlight in the night of darkness of a South American beach. The video produces a surreal impression, typical of Sala’s work, with no plot in the classical sense, no story being told. Like in Blindfold (2002), in which a sunrise is reflected in urban billboards, and Time After Time (2001), in which the figure of a horse emerges from darkness lit by the headlights of an automobile, Sala likes to explore the phenomenon of light and its effects; In Ghost Games, he uses the threatening reflection of the flash light through the darkness of the beach. But unlike several of Sala’s videos’ deliberately slow style, where sometimes the camera does not even move at all, this film is punctuated by the erratic moves of the monster-like creature , its ghostly disappearances into sand holes; the crab’s occasional encounters with the feet of unidentified people standing in the sand, at times like an aggressive dance of protagonists, dramatically adds to the creepy feeling of the scene.","Anri Sala received a degree in painting from the Academy of Fine Arts in that city, and went on to study at the Ecole Nationale Supérieure des Arts Décoratifs in Paris and at the Le Fresnoy, Studio National des Arts Contemporains in Tourcoing (film and video). His work has been exhibited at the Venice Biennale, the Berlin Biennale, the Manifesta 3 in Ljubljana and in numerous solo and group exhibitions. He combines techniques from two realms of art, the moving image and painting. His captivating visual projects on the one hand constitute a penetrating analysis of culture and the human condition as determined by place and political context, and on the other an exploration of the language of imagery, codes of visual communication and structures of film narration. Many of his projects relate to the identity of individuals who function at the fringes of multiple cultures.  Anri Sala was born in 1974 in Tirana, Albania.

But unlike several of Sala’s videos’ deliberately slow style, where sometimes the camera does not even move at all, this film is punctuated by the erratic moves of the monster-like creature , its ghostly disappearances into sand holes; the crab’s occasional encounters with the feet of unidentified people standing in the sand, at times like an aggressive dance of protagonists, dramatically adds to the creepy feeling of the scene.. Anri Sala received a degree in painting from the Academy of Fine Arts in that city, and went on to study at the Ecole Nationale Supérieure des Arts Décoratifs in Paris and at the Le Fresnoy, Studio National des Arts Contemporains in Tourcoing (film and video). His work has been exhibited at the Venice Biennale, the Berlin Biennale, the Manifesta 3 in Ljubljana and in numerous solo and group exhibitions. He combines techniques from two realms of art, the moving image and painting. His captivating visual projects on the one hand constitute a penetrating analysis of culture and the human condition as determined by place and political context, and on the other an exploration of the language of imagery, codes of visual communication and structures of film narration. Many of his projects relate to the identity of individuals who function at the fringes of multiple cultures.  Anri Sala was born in 1974 in Tirana, Albania. He lives and works in Berlin..

Paul McCarthy,"Memory Mistake of the Eldridge Cleaver Pants was created for the show Paul McCarthy’s Low Life Slow Life Part 1, held at California College of the Arts’s Wattis Institute in 2008 and curated by McCarthy himself. In homage to an influence in his early career, McCarthy attempted to reconstruct a pair of pants worn by Black Panther revolutionary Eldridge Cleaver in a picture that appeared in Rolling Stone magazine in the 1970s. But in the process, McCarthy misremembered their original design of the pants, which had black outer panels and white inner panels in white, and left a black shape highlighted in the crotch area. Instead, McCarthy’s reconstruction divides the pants vertically in two black and white sections. McCarthy’s mistake speaks not only of the fallibility of memory but of a certain kind of queerness that resists any categorical—“black or white”—definition. Memory Mistake’s use of aesthetic formalism, error, subjectivity, and social history can be seen to challenge the tropes of modernism and art history.","Known for his transgressive performance art pieces that often challenge social conventions, Paul McCarthy is undoubtedly one of the main figures in the West Coast contemporary art scene. Using different forms from pop culture as source material, McCarthy casts a critical look at American society and consumerism.

Tim Lee,"In the film Untitled (Buster Keaton, 1897) (2010), we see Tim Lee fall down a flight of stairs, referencing a pivotal story from Buster Keaton’s life: At the age of 18 months, he rolled down a flight of stairs, casually shrugged it off, and was then and there christened with the nickname “Buster” by Harry Houdini.

Desiree Holman,"Reborn, 2010 is a three-channel video by Desiree Holman that questions ideas of motherhood and the maternal instinct. The video features a group of women as they tenderly cradle lifelike baby dolls atop their rocking chairs. Although at first, the video might appear as a celebration of the maternal bond, the scene soon becomes eerie and unsettling as we see milk spilling out of the mothers’ mouths. Subsequently, the tone changes dramatically as a group of women in their underwear wearing colorful, bedazzled niqabs, perform an upbeat choreography with the dolls strapped around their bodies.  The work is based on Holman’s research into the curious subculture of ‘reborners,’ a group of women known for hand-making, collecting and caring for hyper-realistic baby dolls called ‘reborns.’ Grounded in fantasy, the vernacular surrounding these dolls often addresses them as living. Fascinated by this, the dolls we see in Hollman’s video were created by the artist in a process that lasted over a year, which involved rooting each individual hair and painstakingly modeling their skin tones.  Reborn is emblematic of Holman’s practice, which, through an anthropologic eye, aims at finding the fissures in established cultural tropes. As per other works by the artist, Reborn disrupts idyllic representations and conventions to bring to the fore the darker, strange and unsettling undertones of human nature.","Combining research, performance, video, digital manipulation, drawing, and installation, Desiree Holman’s multifaceted practice dissects the discourses that structure our shared experience of the social world: from ideas of gender and sexuality to notions of race and motherhood among many others.  Originally trained as a sculptor, the Oakland-based artist places emphasis on objects due to their potential as repositories of meaning. With the help of performers, she then puts these objects to use as costumes or props in performances that the artist describes as “identity play-focused work.” Although Holman generally presents the performances as multi-channel videos, her oeuvre also incorporates traditional gallery works such as drawings and paintings, which a related to the videos on display.

Hans Peter Feldmann,"The types of objects Feldmann is interested in collecting into serial photographic grids or artist’s books are often also found in three dimensional installations.

Martin Creed,"This photograph of Martin Creed himself was used as the invitation card for a fundraising auction of works on paper at Christie’s South Kensington in support of Camden Arts Centre’s first year in a refurbished building in 2005. His broad smile, on the verge of laughter, encourages reciprocity on behalf of the onlooker. This could be said to be a typical tactic in Creed’s work as it is so infused with humor and irony. To him, art is like a game, or certainly very much a part of banal reality. Within the genre of self-portraits, this subverts the usual tradition of images of the artist as creator. Creed often jokes or questions whether the artwork (or in this case the persona of the artist) has any value or exists. Standing in front of a very British brick wall which likely carries art historical connections and puns, Creed seems to mock or certainly stand amazed at his own commercial success. In 2001, he won the Turner Prize with his controversial Work No. 227. The Lights Going on and off.  “I want to make things. I’m not sure why, but I think it’s got something to do with other people.

"Jennifer Allora, Guillermo Calzadilla","This series of photographs is part of the body of work Allora & Calzadilla made regarding the situation in Vieques, an island off the mainland of Puerto Rico used for the 60 years by the U.S Military and NATO forces to practice military bombing exercises. In 2000, they began a collaboration with the local activists to make the campaign more visible. Having added cast rubber reliefs of their slogans and designs to the soles of their shoes, the activists stamped their protest on the reclaimed land. By slightly manipulating everyday objects to become communication tools, Allora & Calzadilla had created “mobile print-making machines” (Yates McKee, October 133, Summer 2010). They then photographed the ephemeral aftermath of these mark-making actions.  Like graffitied walls, the details of these impressions on sandy grounds are landscapes of dissent, willing the transition of propriety back to the inhabitants. In Land Mark #10, numerous footsteps with long statements stamp their resentment in different confused orientations.

Edith DEKYNDT,"The raw materials used in Edith Dekyndt’s work are as intangible as the light, the wind, magnetic waves or the cold…  This artist has conceived works for many years, which she considers “neither spectacular, nor consumable”. She questions the relationship between the world of facts, science and experience on one hand and an eminently subjective approach to the world in what she calls a “universal search of subjectivity”.  Thus the immediate perception of objects that she submits to the spectators is questioned by the paradoxical simplicity of the natural phenomena that she records. The artist then develops an implicit critique of scientific objectivity and suggests that art is a field of knowledge on its own.  Edith Dekyndt looks at the waters of the Dead Sea, that become almost an abstract undersea landscape. The exceptional physical qualities of this salt water make this an unusual study: depth, weightlessness floating, where the presence of salt eradicates any possible life form. Edith Dekyndt films the emptiness and the supposed absence in this sea, in which we can, however, notice an immense richness of movements and colors due to light variations of light. In Dead Sea Drawings, the artist films the surface of the sea, under which she places a white sheet of paper. The shadows of the minerals present at the surface of the water create a random drawing, like an infinite variation of designs. She reminds the spectators that this sea and its coast have been witness to thousands of years of history, different religions and are still marked today by three distinct political entities.

Laure Prouvost,"In Stong Sory Vegetables, Laure Prouvost explains that she woke up one morning and that some vegetables had fallen from the sky on her bed, making a hole in her ceiling. Each video, in this series, is an odd still life representation turning everyday elements into imaginary and funny stories. A tomato, an onion, a lemon and a carrot are displayed in front of the monitor as relics. These vegetables are also present, outside the monitor, to assure the spectators as well that the stories we are hearing are true.  The artist invites us to participate in her stories, and to sort out the inextricable connections between language, image and perception. In many of her videos, Laure Prouvost uses as a starting point her own family life, her acquaintances or even her pets. Her daily stories drift quickly towards odd and funny connections. Thus, in the video Stong Sory, the artist prepares a beautiful cake for her brother’s birthday, which contains living surprises such as spiders and birds.

Each video, in this series, is an odd still life representation turning everyday elements into imaginary and funny stories. A tomato, an onion, a lemon and a carrot are displayed in front of the monitor as relics. These vegetables are also present, outside the monitor, to assure the spectators as well that the stories we are hearing are true.  The artist invites us to participate in her stories, and to sort out the inextricable connections between language, image and perception. In many of her videos, Laure Prouvost uses as a starting point her own family life, her acquaintances or even her pets. Her daily stories drift quickly towards odd and funny connections. Thus, in the video Stong Sory, the artist prepares a beautiful cake for her brother’s birthday, which contains living surprises such as spiders and birds.

Marc Nagtzaam,"Nagtzaam’s medium is drawing and his repertory of forms varies from abstract hard-edge and wall drawing to the reproduction of written material that he collects from art magazines. The artist uses abstract architectural elements that he reproduces on the wall in which he inserts drawings, elements from photographs and drawings of texts collected from art magazines. The repetition, control and imperfection of the movements create a tension, a particular vibration in his geometrical drawings and in the drawings of texts. The idea of repetition, of a copy, appears as an essential ritual element and a ritual in the artist’s work process. Despite a kind of austerity and the evocation of a minimal and conceptual aesthetic, a light goes through his composition giving his work an organic dimension. Exhibition walls, random perspectives and frontal hangings provoke a sort of dizziness and of virtual upheaval.  This work is composed of two wall drawings and three drawings on paper (a protocol allows the installation in different spaces). The artist’s idea is to merge different spaces together, to affirm their existence while denying it (confronting tangible and virtual space). The drawings hung in these spaces reproduces the traces of previous works, in memory of previous projects and past actions. The drawing made out of texts is a patchwork of fragments of sentences coming from Asian magazines. These fragments evoke a different place where the snippets of words complete and contradict each other, and seem to describe, explain as well as disappear. The architectural skeleton, its absence of density, suspends the time of physical experience.

Marwa Arsanios,"I’ve heard stories (2008) is one of Marwa Arsanios early works. It is a short animated film staging a story that took place at the Carlton hotel in Beirut. This work is the first part of a longer project on this iconic building.  In I’ve heard stories, Marwa Arsanios attempts to piece together rumors surrounding the now demolished Hotel Carlton. The hotel was a popular meeting place for gay men living in Beirut, Lebanon, where homosexual acts are considered illegal. At that time (1973 to 1993), the hotel was also the setting of three murders that might or might not have been related to these sexual encounters. Among the victim of these (probably) passionate crimes was the Lebanese politician and businessman Henri Pharaoun. Known as a collector and the richest man in Lebanon during most of his lifetime, Pharaoun was stabbed multiple times by an unknown assailant (his lover, driver or cook). Nora was the only witness to this murder. The nature of the murders went unreported.

Setareh Shahbazi,"Shahbazi’s early drawings in the series “Oh No…” are reminiscent of comic strips or children’s coloring books. Subjects are rendered graphically and set against flat solid colors. The origin of these drawings is a mix of her own collection of images and the Arab Image Foundation’s collection in Beirut, Lebanon. Shahbazi’s most recent work “Spectral Days” takes an introspective turn through a series of photomontages that are based on hundreds of roughly scanned family photographs. Creating spectral figures, Shahbazi delves into the loaded history of her family’s exile from Iran following the revolution. Like the rest of her work, which is built on the logic of free association, these images resist a literal or a linear reading while simultaneously speaking of and surpassing the context from which they were born.

Patty Chang,"The video “Shangri-La” refers to the mythical city of James Hilton’s novel “Lost Horizon” written in 1933 and is exemplified in a film by Frank Capra which speaks of eternal youth in a city of happiness. In 1997, a small town in an agricultural region of central China near the Tibetan border was proclaimed as the place that inspired Shangri-la. Thereafter, a dozen other cities in the same area have claimed to be paradise on earth, prompting a marketing battle without mercy, raging on until the government’s intervention. The mirror used to build the model of the mountain is highly symbolic and often appears in the work of the artist. In literature and art, it represents the transition between reality and the dream world composed of projections and desires. Chang’s work focuses on the reality and fiction inherent in an existing space in both its concrete embodiment and its myth. She explores the idea of a real journey to an imaginary place. This work exposes contradictions: the search for a city’s roots and traditions leads to a falsification of its history, and cultural conflicts inside of touristic and financial goals.","When she arrived in New York in the mid 1990s, Patty Chang became involved in the performance scene.

Elina Brotherus,"A subject’s back stands before a landscape of mountains, arid and majestic, Der Wanderer 3 revisits the theme of man versus nature dear to Romantic painting and the paintings of Caspar David Friedrich in particular. “From him I returned to the theme of the character turning their backs to the viewer. I love the back. The back is quiet, discreet, polite and distant. It does not challenge the viewer as the eye does, the viewer looks at the same landscape as the model, but they are not disturbed.” With the series “The New Painting” made between 2000 and 2004, Brotherus confronts the photographic medium to the codes of classical painting, its subjects and aesthetics, particularly those of the landscape and the use of the nude.","Elina Brotherus depicts, through her photographic work a portrait of the contemporary artist made during different artistic residencies. Frequently in her work, she is the main model. In the series of “Suites françaises”  (French suites) made during a residency of three months at the Musée Nicéphore Niepce at Chalon-sur-Saône in 1999, the artist questions her relation to a foreign language, showing the difficulty in naming things with “post it” stickies. From this work emerges a sense of autobiographical intimacy, of which the camera exists as an absent witness. The artist captures decisive emotional states: the skin texture of a dancer in rehersal, a fine arts model posing as a Degas nude, a state of mind before leaving…The theme of landscape links introspection and contemplation as revealed in her self-portaits.

Barbara Bloom,"In the 1980’s, while browsing Parisian fleamarkets, Barbara Bloom stumbled into an anonymous watercolor (dating to around 1960) in one of Paris’ fleamarkets, probably a study made by an interior designer for a bedroom. The artist found the image to be typically Parisian. The watercolor, framed under a mat made of cardboard, had color tests on its margin, elements that Bloom discovered when she raised it. These details caught her attention and inspired her to create the installation titled The Bedroom. The work presents several elements related to image: a reproduction of the study, a reproduction of another watercolor contained in the set, and a carpet showing the floor of the depicted room (a detail of the carpet under the bed, and a shadow of the chair represented), as well as dabs of paint also present on the edges of the study. The two prints are hung on the wall, painted in light yellow, like the color of the walls in the study. On the floor, the carpet adds a final touch to the domestic aspect of the installation, also existing as a quasi-abstract expressionist painting. The installation plays upon different levels – the perspective effect on the carpet, aquarelle tests from the margin of the study, as well as “real” elements, each becoming decorative patterns for the piece at large.","Collector Barbara Bloom mixes autobiographical details, fictional narratives, and literary quotes. She arranges images and objects, and at the same time she makes transparent fetishitic qualitites which bind her to her objects and installations. The series entitled “Broken Objects” (2001) features celadon-colored porcelain broken by the artist then “repaired” with gold, according to an ancient Japanese technique. Fractures in the porcelain reveal the object’s fragility and imperfection. Like a precious scar, the porcelain’s fracture tells it’s story. The artist compares herself to a detective who unleashes meaning inside of small details. Bloom belongs to the generation of post-modern artists such as Cindy Shermann, Barbara Kruger, Richard Prince, etc. who analyze visual culture and expose its underlying ideologies. Although her practice is conceptual, it is based on objects that she likes or intrigue her. Through her decorative arrangements she refers to museography and the history of museums (the use of vitrines, wall text, name placards, lighting, etc.) and the way the eye operates inside of this context. Her interest in the question of perception is not only related to the visible and its limits, but also to representation, with particular regard to women’s place in history, which explains why she plays with sentimentality, femininity and elegance in some of her objects. Bloom was Jason Dodge’s professor with whom she shares a sense of metonymy: anecdotes of universal dimensions, the object as a trace, as well as memory and vanity.Barbara Bloom was born in 1951 in Los Angeles.

ATLAS GROUP / Walid Raad,"This image is an extract from a notebook in the archives of doctor Fakhouri that lists the cars that have been used for bombs between 1975 and 1991. Each page of the notebook contains a collage of an image of a car with the same make, model and color as the exploded car with a text in Arabic that gives the details of the place, time and date of the explosion, the number of people in the accident, the perimeter of destruction, the weight and the type of explosive. The images of the cars made visible are only equivalents since the cars that actually exploded are totally destroyed. Doctor Fakhouri made reconstitutions while the information collected in the media itself is subject to interpretation. The composition of these images in space is another distancing from the real fact. It is a little known fact that Lebanese historians were also gamblers during the war. They met every Sunday at the race courses. Race after race, the historians were positioned behind the press photographers who were there to take a picture of the winning horse passing the finishing line. The historians betted on how many fractions of seconds before or after passing the line the photograph would be taken. That is to say that no photo showed the horse on the finishing line. Each page of the notebook contains an image of the horse passing the finish line cut out of the Annahar newspaper on the following day. It features the annotations of doctor Fakhouri on the length and duration of the race, on the winning horse and his timing, his average speed, the initials of the different historians and their bets, the time between the snapshot and the passage of the finishing line, a very brief description of the winning historian (here the linguist). These documents provoke questions about historical fact. Why are there no images of the precise moment when the horse passes the finishing line?

January of 2010 was a time of pro-Democracy demonstrators called for the release of activist Liu Xiaobo, drafter of the Charter 08 manifesto calling for the end of authoritarian rule, was sentenced to 11 years in prison one month earlier. Leung’s isolating and highlighting of the photographer by bringing him from the original photograph’s background to the foreground of his studio shot calls attention to the two older cameras and the journalist’s retro-style clothing. This focus brings forth the multiplicity of gazes present in photojournalism and its implications for free speech and freedom of press across the geopolitical history of Hong Kong.","Leung Chi Wo tends to highlight in his art the boundaries between viewing and voyeurism, real and fictional, and art and the everyday. Leung is generally concerned with aspects of photography that are not strictly visual and often considers the local population and sites in his photographic installations to reflect a deeper critical engagement with globalization and global consumerism. Working often with pinhole photography and mixed media while exploring cityscapes, Leung focuses on the emotional expressions of the urban man through figural portraiture.

Adelita Husni-Bey,"Postcards from the Desert Island is a remake of a 50s educational film Holiday from the rules in which four children interact with an omniscient narrator who teleports them to a tropical island where there are no rules. As in Lord of the Flies, the little children’s anarchistic society quickly breaks down.

The film documents how the group of youngsters embraces a social life in a no-man’s land, showing how they relate to some of the key principles and unresolved problems of self-governance, such as imagining a life without institutions;, questioning of punishment and the struggle for power, wondering how to deal with immigration and civil disobedience, and where to draw the line between public and private realms.","Born in Milan, Italian-Libyan Adelita Husni-Bey is an artist and researcher.

Fernanda Gomes,"For this floor based work, Gomes has taken two lengths of bamboo and tied them together using linen thread. The work is self-supporting and stands in a crack or a hole in the floor. The work suggests precariousness, frailty as well as humanity through its verticality, and its gentle sinuous form, referencing perhaps the work of Giacometti. Other works in the exhibition recalled the work of Mondrian with an emphasis on horizontal and vertical lines. The fact that this work deviates from an emphasis on the rectilinear should be seen within the context of Gomes’s constructivist routes and her interest in Arte Povera. Allowing the material to express its own inner nature is fundamental to her work. The modest nature of her art suggests a poetics of the immaterial. The standing sculpture, modest though it may be, articulates the space of the room, suggesting a near and a far. Gomes generally makes her work in situ, responding to the space the exhibition will occupy, the gallery thus becoming an extension of her studio.","Fernanda Gomes was born and still works in Rio de Janeiro. Her work is within the tradition of Latin American art that engaged in the postwar era with constructivism and minimalism. Lygia Clark, Helio Oiticica, Lucio Fontana are the names that come to mind when thinking of her Latin American antecedents but in terms of her Northern American forebears it is the Minimalist generation of Robert Ryman and Richard Tuttle that have a bearing on her work. Fernanda Gomes should neither be seen as a Minimalist, nor as an artist in the tradition of Arte Povera, to which her work also clearly relates.

The work is self-supporting and stands in a crack or a hole in the floor. The work suggests precariousness, frailty as well as humanity through its verticality, and its gentle sinuous form, referencing perhaps the work of Giacometti. Other works in the exhibition recalled the work of Mondrian with an emphasis on horizontal and vertical lines. The fact that this work deviates from an emphasis on the rectilinear should be seen within the context of Gomes’s constructivist routes and her interest in Arte Povera. Allowing the material to express its own inner nature is fundamental to her work. The modest nature of her art suggests a poetics of the immaterial. The standing sculpture, modest though it may be, articulates the space of the room, suggesting a near and a far. Gomes generally makes her work in situ, responding to the space the exhibition will occupy, the gallery thus becoming an extension of her studio.. Fernanda Gomes was born and still works in Rio de Janeiro. Her work is within the tradition of Latin American art that engaged in the postwar era with constructivism and minimalism. Lygia Clark, Helio Oiticica, Lucio Fontana are the names that come to mind when thinking of her Latin American antecedents but in terms of her Northern American forebears it is the Minimalist generation of Robert Ryman and Richard Tuttle that have a bearing on her work. Fernanda Gomes should neither be seen as a Minimalist, nor as an artist in the tradition of Arte Povera, to which her work also clearly relates.  Rather she makes paintings, and more particularly sculptures which are intimate, that examine the interface between sculpture and painting, that look at the gap between the intentional and the accidental as well as the purity of form that is disturbed by the patina of age and time. Her action in bringing materials together is transformative. She sees her works as things, rather than paintings or sculptures, things that relate to and have an effect on the space they inhabit.

Karla Black,"Karla Black is a Scottish artist living in Glasgow. Her work draws from a multiplicity of artistic traditions from expressionist painting, land art performance, to formalism. Her large-scale sculptures incorporate modest everyday substances, along with very traditional art-making materials to create abstract forms. Black chooses her media for their tactile aesthetic appeal: the familiarity of the texture of cellophane or the scent of cosmetics bridges the experience of tangible matter with the intimacy of memory or the subconscious. Black’s process is intensely physical and this energy is conveyed through ‘impromptu’ staging of her work; this suggestion of performance psychologically involves the viewer with the making process, provoking instinctive responses to her precarious assemblages. Black’s work evinces childhood memories of cakes and candy floss, of birthdays and ice cream. It is absorptive, immersive and engaging, painterly and sculptural, ephemeral and yet permanent. It always has a fragile appearance and is often fragile, capable of being destroyed by a draught or the actions of a viewer. It teeters on the edge of being and non being.     Not Today is essentially a painting on three sheets of transparent plastic suspended from the walls by scotch tape. These materials are typical of Black’s art.  Suspended in front of a white wall or even a window, the work is as much about light as it is about colour. The layers of the painting coalesce into one plane when the visitor stands before it and yet as a layered painting it also has actual depth.  Black says of her work: “sculpture … can be a pure engulfment and absorption in the material world, when you’re not even aware of yourself, when you have no self consciousness, and you’re not being watched and you’re just purely absorbed in the material world. That is the best possible kind of escape – when you are fully connected to yourself. I think about art as a place to behave, as an escape, not just for me but for the people looking at it,” says Black.  Her emphasis is on materials and their behaviour. “My work is just rooted in the physical, it just is a thing; it’s real. You don’t have to think, “What does it represent?” or “What does it mean?” It is just, like, it is here. And you’re here. And it is just that exchange.“","Karla Black is a Scottish artist living in Glasgow.

In general, Kwan’s works explore the nexus between art and text and use repetition as a constant measure of time and a metaphor for life as he states: “Repetition gives the work power.” He is especially interested in how meaning is constructed, who makes art, and the interaction of other people, places and things as part of the work’s cultural context..

Hayoun Kwon,"Lack of evidence is the account of a Nigerian called Oscar exiled in France, which confronts a historical and social reality with a personal and intimate testimony. Taking as a point of departure Oscar’s request for asylum in France, this fictional document is a peregrination on the different levels of the reconstitution of memory and the subjectivity of its interpretation.  Oscar’s legal testimony reveals a dramatic reality taking place in Nigeria, where family executions still exist in the case of having twins who are considered a ‘diabolical off-spring’. Oscar’s request was rejected based on a lack of evidence. With the use of 3D, Kwon reassessed the real and fictitious qualities of Oscar’s story. The film is constructed through sequences juxtaposing different realities and then by becoming an ideal mise en abîme of the story.

Köken Ergun,"The Battle of Karbala was a military engagement that took place on 10 Muharram, 61 AH (October 10th, 680) in Karbala, situated in present day Iraq, when Hussein, the grandson of the prophet Muhammad, was killed. This battle is central to Shia Muslim belief in which Hussein’s martyrdom is commemorated each year, in a celebration called Ashura which symbolises the birth of Muslim division still at issue today between the Shia and Sunni. During Ashura, the artist worked in close collaboration with the people of Zeynebiye (referring to Hussein’s courageous sister, Zeyneb), documenting their preparations for the ceremonies, which involve a mass theatre performance and the isolated, weeping ritual at the end of the Ashura day. What in other countries is celebrated through a collective performance of blood and pain is experienced here through a highly theatrical and emotional day, presenting Islam as the practice of a culture rather than politics. Ergun attempts to question the cultural importance of religions against a “radical secularism” that has ruled Turkey until now.","Born in Istanbul, in 1976, Köken Ergun studied acting and worked with the American theatre director Robert Wilson.

This battle is central to Shia Muslim belief in which Hussein’s martyrdom is commemorated each year, in a celebration called Ashura which symbolises the birth of Muslim division still at issue today between the Shia and Sunni. During Ashura, the artist worked in close collaboration with the people of Zeynebiye (referring to Hussein’s courageous sister, Zeyneb), documenting their preparations for the ceremonies, which involve a mass theatre performance and the isolated, weeping ritual at the end of the Ashura day. What in other countries is celebrated through a collective performance of blood and pain is experienced here through a highly theatrical and emotional day, presenting Islam as the practice of a culture rather than politics. Ergun attempts to question the cultural importance of religions against a “radical secularism” that has ruled Turkey until now..

Uri Aran,"Like much of Aran’s work this sculptural installation is akin to a riddle. It has no exact meaning, and it can be somewhat frustrating, yet with careful inspection it begins to reveal unexpected information. In his 2014 exhibition at Peep-Hole, Milan, where this work was shown, Aran referred in a series of new works to Mancala games. These ancient pastimes (popular throughout the Middle East, Africa and Asia) typically employ a perforated board and pieces formed out of seeds or stones. In an analogy to agricultural activity, Mancala games are at once elementary and poetically allusive; in their combination of improvised apparatus, rudimentary rules and metaphorical potency, they furnish an oblique metaphor for Aran’s art, in particular his ranging, open-ended and atemporal mode of sculpture. The still-life assemblage Game II elaborates upon the idea of ‘art as game’, embodying the same basic interplay of organization and chance, recalling childhood games and activities. While the work invokes Giacometti’s No More Play it also suggests the active processes of making works of art, conscious, unconscious and trial and error.","Born in 1977 in JerusalemLives and works in New York.  Uri Aran, born in Israel and based in New York, is young artist working in sculpture, installation, video and drawing. Much of Aran’s work is about grouping things together, assembling the detritus of the studio, images and objects that relate to his own life, in an attempt to make sense out of random things. He has stated: “In my own work the excitement and simultaneous pathos associated with the limitations of taxonomy are always present. I don’t establish logical equivalencies (…) instead I take parts of lists, classifications and narrative habits and I pluck, recapitulate and re-assign. My work has nothing to do with nonsense – in fact quite the opposite. I activate the highly sensitive reflex responses that a viewer might have to a trigger such as a piece of music, food, or a photo and I adjust the allegiances of that reflex. In this manner objects, language, intonation, everything develops an eccentricity that can be unnerving, perplexing, funny, poetic, and tragic ad infinitum.”",Game II,Americas,"['game.n.01', 'open-ended.s.01', 'autobiography.n.01', 'procedure.n.01', 'conscious.s.01', 'trial_and_error.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/ua_peephole_03.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/ua_peephole_03-200x300.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/game-ii/,"Like much of Aran’s work this sculptural installation is akin to a riddle.

In an analogy to agricultural activity, Mancala games are at once elementary and poetically allusive; in their combination of improvised apparatus, rudimentary rules and metaphorical potency, they furnish an oblique metaphor for Aran’s art, in particular his ranging, open-ended and atemporal mode of sculpture. The still-life assemblage Game II elaborates upon the idea of ‘art as game’, embodying the same basic interplay of organization and chance, recalling childhood games and activities. While the work invokes Giacometti’s No More Play it also suggests the active processes of making works of art, conscious, unconscious and trial and error.. Born in 1977 in JerusalemLives and works in New York.  Uri Aran, born in Israel and based in New York, is young artist working in sculpture, installation, video and drawing. Much of Aran’s work is about grouping things together, assembling the detritus of the studio, images and objects that relate to his own life, in an attempt to make sense out of random things. He has stated: “In my own work the excitement and simultaneous pathos associated with the limitations of taxonomy are always present. I don’t establish logical equivalencies (…) instead I take parts of lists, classifications and narrative habits and I pluck, recapitulate and re-assign. My work has nothing to do with nonsense – in fact quite the opposite. I activate the highly sensitive reflex responses that a viewer might have to a trigger such as a piece of music, food, or a photo and I adjust the allegiances of that reflex. In this manner objects, language, intonation, everything develops an eccentricity that can be unnerving, perplexing, funny, poetic, and tragic ad infinitum.”.

Felix Gmelin,"Ambiguous Gestures takes as its point of origin a film Gmelin discovered in his father’s archive. Filmed from a fixed point, it portrays his father in an intimate performance of body painting with a woman unknown to Felix Gmelin. The discovery of this footage was obviously disturbing. On the one hand there is an erotic encounter with someone who is not Gmelin’s mother; on the other hand the performance itself is strangely unerotic and unsensual. The performance clearly references the work of Klein and the Viennese actionists but has an Arcadian element divorced from the Viennese school. Two acts of painting take place; the mutual painting of bodies and the impression of those bodies on a series of canvases. Taking that as his own starting point, working from stills Felix Gmelin then painted his own paintings with the help also of an assistant, thus paralleling the process of his father. He wanted to focus on the painting aspect of the film rather than its erotic potential and draw a comparison between painting and film, further enhanced by the display of stills that forms part of the installation. The grisâtre quality of the paintings serves to highlight the intense colour of the film. By making what in some respects are conventional paintings from this most intimate of films, and painting found images, Gmelin neutralises its erotic charge, making the film ‘innocent, beautiful and affirmative’. While the film is ‘embarrassing in every possible sense’ to the artist, its conjunction with his paintings and the stills transforms it into another manifestation of a utopian project. Gmelin cleanses his father ‘s work literally and metaphorically, washing the film and creating paintings using rubber gloves and brushes.","With a degree in painting and inspired by so-called institutional criticism, Felix Gmelin is interested in the possibilities of painting as a form of resistance and its direct relation to a form of socio-political reality.

Filmed from a fixed point, it portrays his father in an intimate performance of body painting with a woman unknown to Felix Gmelin. The discovery of this footage was obviously disturbing. On the one hand there is an erotic encounter with someone who is not Gmelin’s mother; on the other hand the performance itself is strangely unerotic and unsensual. The performance clearly references the work of Klein and the Viennese actionists but has an Arcadian element divorced from the Viennese school. Two acts of painting take place; the mutual painting of bodies and the impression of those bodies on a series of canvases. Taking that as his own starting point, working from stills Felix Gmelin then painted his own paintings with the help also of an assistant, thus paralleling the process of his father. He wanted to focus on the painting aspect of the film rather than its erotic potential and draw a comparison between painting and film, further enhanced by the display of stills that forms part of the installation. The grisâtre quality of the paintings serves to highlight the intense colour of the film. By making what in some respects are conventional paintings from this most intimate of films, and painting found images, Gmelin neutralises its erotic charge, making the film ‘innocent, beautiful and affirmative’. While the film is ‘embarrassing in every possible sense’ to the artist, its conjunction with his paintings and the stills transforms it into another manifestation of a utopian project. Gmelin cleanses his father ‘s work literally and metaphorically, washing the film and creating paintings using rubber gloves and brushes.. With a degree in painting and inspired by so-called institutional criticism, Felix Gmelin is interested in the possibilities of painting as a form of resistance and its direct relation to a form of socio-political reality. He is frequently known to rework the experiences of his youth into his art. In a critical, yet personal investigation, he subtly unravels the complicated interweaving of self-development, socialization and emancipation with which he grew up in the late 1960s and 1970s.

Thomas Kilpper,"These two images come from the series called “State of Control” which Kilpper made in the building formerly occupied by the Stasi in Berlin. As a symbol of the past there could be none more powerful than this. By carving into its floor, Kilpper laid bare its history by making images of its occupants and political figures associated with that period of history. Willy Brandt, Guenter Guillaume and Dietrich Sperling reminds us of all the intrigue of the Cold War when Brandt’s secretary Guillaume was passing secrets at the highest level to the East. Seen whispering in Brandt’s ear, he is perceived to be feeding false information. Sperling was a minister in Brandt’s government. The photograph on which the image is based was taken at the height of Guillaume’s treachery and treasonous conduct. The image of John Heartfield standing behind Silvio Berlusconi is based on a photomontage of Heartfield with the President of the Berlin Police Karl Zoergiebel of 1929 thus bringing together Heartfield, one of the greatest and most vivid critics of the Nazi era and manipulator of images through collage, with Berlusconi, one of the most rightwing, but freely elected leaders in Europe who manipulates the news and images through his media empire. These images are large scale and have a dramatic impact. In his use of woodcut, Kilpper’s work resonates with the large scale woodcuts of Christiane Baumgartner already in the collection.","Thomas Kilpper’s work engages with history and politics in a manner that recalls the 1960s in terms of his committed engagement. Typically Kilpper takes over a building and investigates its history, carving into the floor to make woodcuts which he then prints on a large scale onto fabric that floats free when he hangs it. In The Ring, a project he made in London in 2000, and of which the Tate bought a substantial part, he investigated the history of the area in which the building of the Tate was situated, making images connected with boxing (the site had previously housed a well known boxing ring), the Ministry of Defense (which had a secret printing press in the building) and Tate Modern (that was about to open around the corner). In Drowning Hercules he used bits of wood from Riddell House, a building about to be demolished to build an oversized tree which he located in the defunct swimming pool. Kilpper’s strategy is to work with buildings condemned for demolition and to use only materials he finds on site to make art. In that respect his work engages with the art of Gordon Matta-Clark but by inscribing himself into the building, rather than simply cutting it up, he puts forward a different point of view. He has no studio, is constantly on the move and starts each project from scratch. Research is a fundamental tool of his practice and the result is normally an artistic intervention into politics and history.

Christian Jankowski,"In New York City’s Chinatown, subject Suat Ling Chua’s morning exercise is to practice the hula hoop. When Christian Jankowski first saw this woman he immediately got the idea to shoot Rooftop Routine. In the short video, Chua leads the group and dictates the movements that each participant has to repeat. Only one person of the group can directly see Chua and thus each person mimics another from roof to roof, altering the choreography after each passage like in a play of “Chinese whispers.” With this performance, Jankowski explores the social organization of a specific context. It brings together people of several buildings in the same project beyond isolation and social barriers of the urban environment. “In a work, new things, unknown things can happen. The important thing is to initiate a project to bring together the right people. Then the mechanism takes unpredictable paths. Until…voila!..the work is done,” says Jankowski.","Christian Jankowski’s practice ranges from photography, films, and performances, involving audiences or often people unfamiliar to contemporary art. He claims that his “main drive always comes from the pleasure of meeting people and working with them.” Through the manipulation of humor, collaboration, popular culture and magic, Jankowski creates links between art and people with a certain simplicity and relevance. Meeting with participants and making negotiations are an integral part of his work, as well as the elements of chance and accident. Jankowski’s work is about life as it is lived. His way of juxtaposing different worlds and subcultures as a way to explore social systems and their organization is both attractive and serious. In one of his early work My Life as a Dove (1996), the artist was transformed into a dove by a magician.

John Isaacs,"A child and dreamer my whole life long (broken tree) (2004) is a sculpture made of filler, wire, copper, oil paint, and wood depicting a tree just at it’s moment of breaking into half – one part alive with foliage and blooming branches and the other the crisp of the break exposed, with the trunk adhered solidly to a plinth. The sculpture appears to speak quite bluntly about Isaac’s own sense of bleak pessimism when exposing a severed tree, the universe’s sacred sign of life and birth. Through the perfect rendering of this encapsulated moment, Isaacs demonstrates the strength of the sculptural artifact and his interest in failure and fragility. It also denotes that a sculpture is capable of giving off a very emotive and sensory feeling in an instant– the crisp snap of life through the metaphor of the break of the tree.","John Isaacs’ work encompasses many different media, though much of it has origins in sculpture. The artist continually redefines his style, moving seamlessly through installation, sculpture, photography, film, painting and drawing. Whatever the media, Isaacs’ pieces typically inspire contemplation. Whether it is a grotesquely real, severed arm with the word HATE tattooed across its knuckles, or a small, painterly ink drawing of a unicorn, the artist’s work always contains a thread of mystical wonder and brutish reality. Through his often humorous mixing of appealing optimism with abject pessimism, Isaacs examines our historically and culturally determined conventions. In so doing, the artist makes no distinctions between high and low, finding instead that all things have their root in the same base instincts. In his work, there is a strong sense of the universal connection that underlies our apparent isolation from one another as well as the presence of dreams, successes and failures of the individual and society.

Fabrice Hyber,"The works of Fabrice Hyber provoke divergent ways of thinking. In a kindred spirit with Raymond Hains, image and writing are intertwined.

In Cellman (2003) on the bottom right, stones and the arrows refer to skipping stones of “thinking”. A recurring human figure, commonly associated with Hyber’s theatrical world, is shown in Cellman and also L’homme de Bessines (1990). The artist uses writing as an engine of formal and semantic associations (“galet, galette, cellman, bulle, cellule “). The figure recalls that the body is a collection of cells.

Deimantas Narkevicius,"The Dud Effect is a film that revisits the fear of nuclear attacks during the Cold War by staging the firing of a R-14 missile by a solitary soldier on the site of a real Soviet launch base installed in Lithuania. For this film, Deimantas Narkevicius used no animation or 3D effects, instead it is the silence of the place interrupted by the voice of the Russian soldier (who truly served on a military base in Lithuania) that creates this worrying atmosphere in which the execution of such an act becomes possible. The War Game (1965) by Peter Watkins was a source of inspiration, since he displays a personal and collective concern about the danger of the nuclear arms race in the United Kingdom in the 1960s.","Deimantas Narkevicius is a key figure in the Lithuanian art scene today.

He received the Vincent Award with Francis Alys in 2008. Trained as a sculptor, Deimantas Narkevicius then developed his work towards narrative through film and video. He considers History as central to his practice, as live material; he plays on the double meaning of the term history, by relating his personal story with that of his country.

Martin Boyce,"In the installation Our Love is like the Flowers, the Rain, the Sea and the Hours, Martin Boyce uses common elements from public gardens – trees, benches, trashbins– in a game which describes at once a social space and an abstract dream space. The trees, unique sources of light in the exhibition space, produce their own environment. These sculptures, as if extracted from a set, are enough to suggest an atmosphere, a landscape, or a movie. Their nocturnal depiction is ambivalent, hovering between poetic beauty and the potential threat of a park at night. Romantic views of nature blend with modern ideas of optimism and equality. However, from it emerges from a deep anxiety or paranoia. The perceived space cannot be localized inside a certain reality, rather it pertains to the everyone’s imagination. Therefore, in the installation, the viewer produces what he sees around him with his own eyes and own journey through the space. Its space becomes the psychological and emotional space of an idler. When describing the piece, Boyce has stated that the sculptures move far from the visible and the material generating more of an emotional state rather than theoretical reflection.  “My installations draw upon imaginary and fragmented landscapes. When I introduce an object within an installation, it recalls the world from where it is derived from, like a fragment, it is a exploded variation.” The universe of Martin Boyce is multifarious, extracting fragments of reference as varied as architecture, design, cinema, Scottish literature, Japanese poetry, etc. His forms do not fit perfectly within one category and exist more as ghosts of meaning. For instance, a sculpture can distinctly resemble a tilted ping-pong table although all the elements deviate from such a table to a great extent. Concrete trees by Joel and Jan Martel made in 1925 for the Decorative Arts Exhibition in Paris are a recurrent theme throughout the work of Boyce, as well as replicas in “Electric trees and telephone booth” (2006) and formal traces in works such as “We are still and reflective” (2007). The artist sees these objects as a perfect “collapse” between architecture and nature. The sculptures, consisting of trees, gates, vents, signs, dot the exhibition space, becoming a stage. While the forms and materials from were conceived to be functional, Martin Boyce uses them less as objects of representation and more as objects of emotion. Their titles, extracted from fragments of poems, pop songs, slogans, exist as a way to “inhabit” the installations and poeticize the real.","“My installations draw upon imaginary and fragmented landscapes.

Katinka Bock,"«I will put two heavy stones in my jacket pockets that way my body will sink deep like a deflated truck tire, no one will notice», this excerpt from “Quay West” by Koltès could echo the story depicted by Katinka Bock: the shipwreck of a small boat full of stones.

The operator’s gaze creates a landscape undetermined in space and time. An encounter between density and liquid: the effect produced is strange and paradoxical since the rocks are floating, temporarily denying gravity.

Jordan Wolfson,"Dreaming of the dream of the dream is a 16mm projection consisting of images of waves that come and go continuously.

Anna Molska,"Perspective was filmed during a residence in northern Poland. The film is preceded by a series of photographs made ??in her studio. In a snowy landscape, the artist walks towards the horizon secured by ropes. The film records the appearance of a geometric construction that unfolds in space, but also the physical effort of the artist to create it. Finally, she reaches a climax when the strings form a perspective on the landscape. At the same time, freed from the studio, but still a prisoner of the ropes, the more she walks, the space extends further.  The piece features a physical struggle to reach the horizon, and the ideal point where the hypothetical perspective lines meet. The film reveals the impossibility of art to reflect both dimensions in a two-dimensional space as if the perspective tools developed in the Renaissance are no longer allowed to read the world.","Anna Molska uses video performance to explore the effect of artistic culture on the production of art.

The film is preceded by a series of photographs made ??in her studio. In a snowy landscape, the artist walks towards the horizon secured by ropes. The film records the appearance of a geometric construction that unfolds in space, but also the physical effort of the artist to create it. Finally, she reaches a climax when the strings form a perspective on the landscape. At the same time, freed from the studio, but still a prisoner of the ropes, the more she walks, the space extends further.  The piece features a physical struggle to reach the horizon, and the ideal point where the hypothetical perspective lines meet. The film reveals the impossibility of art to reflect both dimensions in a two-dimensional space as if the perspective tools developed in the Renaissance are no longer allowed to read the world..

This mode of transport – both futuristic and obsolete – crystallizes a collective imaginary which was fed by cinematic, literary and mythological fiction as Barthes would put it. A mass advances progressively towards the spectator, the camera glides right up to this monster, which is as graceful as a sea mammal, but flames perturb this vision. The mass disappears from view, making it impossible to define clearly, and finally exits the image field. Realized with an anaglyph process – which superimposes two slightly offset images to produce an effect of depth – the film prevents the experience of the third dimension and emphasizes the tricks of fabrication since it is viewed without special glasses.

Trevor Yeung,"“We both died at the same moment” is a humorous observation of anthropomorphism, the attribution of human emotions to nature and animals. A siliquaria armata is a slitworm that loosley-coiles a shell. Growing inside a sea-bed, a siliquaria armata will grow vertically until it touches another siliquaria armata, at which point they will knot together. Once caught by fishermen, the two worms die at the same time. Yeung undermines this romanticized phenomenon by emphasizing the emotionless in the process from the life to death of a slitworm. Yet while Yeung’s theoretical interrogation of life and death in nature and humankinds tendency to romanticize the unknown and the unknowable, “We both died at the same moment” simultaneously connotes a mythologisation of the slitworms. The vitrine, a showcase usually hosting Buddhist sculptures, common in Hong Kong, which houses the slitworm aggrandizes the phenomenon of dying at the same time of knotted siliquaria armata’s. “We both died at the same moment” puts into question the desire and tendency to romanticize nature, turning to a slitworm as a metaphor for beauty, life and death.","Trevor Yeung’s (b. 1988, Guangdong Province, China) practice, traversing a wide range of mixed media works from drawings and photographs, small objects and installations, is a delicate examination of human relations and processing.

Clemens von Wedemeyer,"Die Siedlung is a filmic documentary about the recent shift in housing developments in Leipzig-Grünau in former East Germany and its consequences on some inhabitants. It complements von Wedemeyer slightly earlier and more artistic film Silberhöhe (2003) which decried imposed Modernist living model. In Die Siedlung, a voiceover describes and criticizes the different sites on view while the camera moves slowly past a vast abandoned 1930s Nazi army barracks which has yet to be converted or demolished, the building site and wastelands for the new private single family housing area, a constructed pond and finally the 1960s or 70s communal blocks of flats. An estate agent is recorded introducing the newer building site and its future plans in rather deadpan and unconvincing terms, according to him the Bauhaus concept has met resistance from the majority of buyers. A cynical jobseeker expresses his disgust faced with the notion of private property in an interview. The short piece quietly but efficiently denounces the blind pressures of “social reconditioning”. Von Wedemeyer’s work borrows from cinematic or documentary conventions (alike or separately) to analyze architecture as well as urban planning and their impact on behavior with great acuity.","Clemens Von Wedemeyer is certainly one of the artists of his generation that make intelligible our relationship to reality through the use of different transmissions of images, whether through film or video. The artist employs the documentary genre as a method in his analysis of reality. However, his use of fiction gives us the opportunity to examine different images. Referencing the work of Antonioni with “Silberhöhe”, he puts us in a genealogy of directors who have also questioned the complex relationship between fiction and reality. If the video “Silberhöhe” gives us clues to understanding some aspects of reality, the poetic dimension of the artifices of fiction offer more complex visions of the world.Clemens Von Wedemeyer was born in 1974 in Göttingen, Germany.

A cynical jobseeker expresses his disgust faced with the notion of private property in an interview. The short piece quietly but efficiently denounces the blind pressures of “social reconditioning”. Von Wedemeyer’s work borrows from cinematic or documentary conventions (alike or separately) to analyze architecture as well as urban planning and their impact on behavior with great acuity.. Clemens Von Wedemeyer is certainly one of the artists of his generation that make intelligible our relationship to reality through the use of different transmissions of images, whether through film or video. The artist employs the documentary genre as a method in his analysis of reality. However, his use of fiction gives us the opportunity to examine different images. Referencing the work of Antonioni with “Silberhöhe”, he puts us in a genealogy of directors who have also questioned the complex relationship between fiction and reality. If the video “Silberhöhe” gives us clues to understanding some aspects of reality, the poetic dimension of the artifices of fiction offer more complex visions of the world.Clemens Von Wedemeyer was born in 1974 in Göttingen, Germany.

Toby Ziegler,"Wagon Wheel is a work with a fundamental dynamism that derives both from the rotating movement of the elements suspended on poles and the kicking of the legs of the figure. It is based on a pornographic image by Giulio Romano (ca.1499-1546). Romano had completed Raphael’s frescos in the Vatican after the latter’s death but was not paid for the work. Ziegler relates how in revenge Romano drew pornographic images on the buildings of the Vatican. The Pope erased them but Marcantonio Raimondi (ca. 1480-1534) turned the images into prints, a series called « I Modi », which were widely circulated in Rome and for which he was jailed. The Pope, realising they brought him into disrepute, gathered them all together and destroyed them. Other artists had copied them, however, and such copies exist in the British Museum.  Wagon Wheel is the first sculpture of the figure that Ziegler made. He has since moved into figurative painting but he states that he could not have done this without making sculpture first. He believes this particular work is crucial to that development. It was inspired not only by the Romano prints, but also by seeing a sculpture of hands by Rodin. He feels that most of Rodin’s sculptures are too complete for him to be able to work off them. But the sculpture of a hand fired his imagination because of its incompleteness.  Wagon Wheel also relates to the sculpture of Ancient Greece which is frequently displayed as a compilation of fragments, with armatures supporting disparate parts and acting as surrogate limbs or body parts.","Toby Ziegler is a British artist whose work first came to view in an exhibition called Expander in 2004.

Bruno Pacheco,"En Guard Souvenir is composed of a group of eleven elements (ten paintings on paper and a sculpture) which deconstructs and recomposes the context of Tienanmen Square in Beijing. This square is known for numerous political events : the cultural revolution between 1966 and 1976, the arrest of the Gang of Four and protests in 1989 where thousands of demonstrators who were protesting against the corruption of the regime were killed. In this work, Bruno Pacheco alludes to the historical importance of this place, the choice of viewpoints reveals very precise but sporadic details there : part of the mausoleum devoted to Mao, a portrait of him and its frame, a view overlooking the Forbidden City, etc. On the square, two guards stand on their platform, facing each other, executing their rituals. The installation leads one to think about various angles of approach within a historical discontinuity.  With a certain spontaneity, Bruno Pacheco crystallizes the gestures of the characters (guards) in his paintings. The different viewpoints are organized in order to construct a rhythmic visual narration. The sculpture is to be perceived at the centre point of the installation, it is the platform also found in the paintings though this one is empty, figuring the absence for the guard and require the public’s projection in order to understand the participation of this object within the installation.

Gimhongsok,"To explore the boundaries between artwork and audience, Gimhongsok created a series of sculptural performances in which a person wearing an animal costume poses in the gallery.

But both the performer and the financial transaction existed only in the text, truths concealed by the costume and social propriety. By interchanging physical realities and contexts and obscuring details, Gimhongsok challenges the effectiveness of visual and textual communication to create a potential moral anxiety in the viewers.. Raising questions about South Korea’s position in the world beyond its own social and political borders, Seoul-based artist Gimhongsok investigates communication, language, and popular culture. Gimhongsok’s ideas and deadpan satirical humor manifest themselves in many media and, because his creative process and personal style remain enigmatic, he is considered to be a “mysterious genius” in his homeland. Whether overt or implicit in their message, Gimhongsok’s spectacular works juxtapose image and language to lure viewers into a labyrinthine journey towards ever-elusive meaning..

Melvin Moti,"“The Prisoner’s Cinema” is a phenomenon described in neurology as a hallucination, that appears after a prolonged absence of visual sensations. A blind screen of hallucinations forms itself on the eyes cut off from visual stimuli. The subject can see this projection, but fails to register these mental images, transforming it into an intimate and personal experience. In 1954, a scientist studied the syndrome of prisoners locked up in dark cells. This phenomenon is also common to truck drivers caught in a snowstorm. Melvin Moti is interested in the relationship between hallucination and formalism. Constant forms and geometric shapes appear on a recurring basis. A constant form is a form whose interpretation is not based on a cultural contingency, but that appears at different times and in different cultures, and forms no history and no future. The Prisoner’s Cinema consists of abstract images, rays of light through a window, and explanations of a scientist describing his vision after undergoing sensory deprivation for several days. This is about the origins of the film, creating an image of the power image of the subject, the unconscious, history of abstraction and formalism.","Scientific research, high and mass culture, and the processes of cultural production in contemporary society plays an important role in the work of Rotterdam-born artist Melvin Moti, currently based in Rotterdam and in Berlin. The artist whose practice traverses films, books, objects and drawing, enquires into the power of human imagination and abstraction, looking at how perception works neurologically and psychologically. His earlier works include a guided tour in the empty rooms of the Hermitage through memory (No Show, 2004), the human ability to make images appear on the retina from total darkness (The Prisoner’s Cinema, 2008) or the representation of the fourth dimension (The Eightfold Dot, 2013). The artist gives form to obscure anecdotes, incidents, and individuals — or, what he calls black holes — that he claims haven’t been contextualized by official history. Concerned with history and its influence in cultural production, Moti researched the Cosmists, an early twentieth century Russian group of thinkers responsible for Cosmism, the philosophical and cultural movement that combined occult and esoteric theories with space science. By comparing statistics, scientist and member of the Cosmists, Alexander Chizhevsky, discovered a correlation between solar activity (such as sunspots) and major historical events on earth (such as wars, revolutions, epidemics and natural disasters). In several studies Chizhevsky describes how one can observe an increase in wars, revolutions, and in epidemics on earth during years of high amounts of solar activity, while years with a low amount of solar activity correspond to a decrease of military and political events on earth. Chizevsky called this observed synchrony “historiometry”.

Pierre Leguillon,"End of 2008, Pierre Leguillon presented at Kadist Art Foundation the first retrospective of the works of Diane Arbus (1923-1971) organized in France since 1980, bringing together all the images commissioned to the New York photographer by the Anglo-American press in the 1960s. This exhibition, destined to tour in various locations, presents the original pages of the magazines, including ‘Harper’s Bazaar’, ‘Esquire’, ‘Nova’ and ‘The Sunday Times Magazine’. As Pierre Leguillon states on the exhbition’s publication: ‘The mythology surrounding Diane Arbus’ character is willingly set aside to offer a more neutral point of view on a more unfamiliar part of her work, although it was mass-distributed. Many of the characters portrayed in these commissioned works seem less sensational at first glance than the ‘freaks’ that made Diane Arbus’ work so famous, since the retrospective MOMA organized in 1973 in New York, two years after her suicide. And yet, “leafing through” all her contributions for the press, the Diane Arbus “method”, her installing the model in an environment in such a particular way, emerges obviously. Long sitting sessions, sometimes repeated, were destined to allow the model to « let go », while he never stopped fixing the camera, straight forward.

Felipe Arturo,"Primero estaba el mar (First Was the Sea, 2012) is a system of equivalences between syllables and silhouettes of waveforms cast in cement. Each waveform represents a syllable of the sentence “Primero estaba el mar.” This sentence is the first verse of the Kogui poem of creation. For the Koguis, an indigenous community from the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta on the Colombian Caribbean coast, water was the absolute presence before the creation of the universe. The Colombian writer Tomás González used this phrase as the title of his first novel, in which he narrates the story of a couple in Medellín who, following the anarchic and hippie trends of the 1970s, abandon civilization and move to a solitary beach. Instead of leaving modernity behind, however, the couple becomes a colonizing force, transforming the natural environment of the beach into a rationalized territory. Under the logic proposed by Primero estaba el mar, the variation of the order of the waveforms represents different possibilities for this sentence. The work produces eight different phrases that assimilate the idea of repetition and change; the sentence has eight syllables, and each syllable-waveform is repeated eight times in order to reconstruct the title eight different times, resulting in a total of sixty-four pieces.","Felipe Arturo considers elements from urbanism, architecture, and art in relation to politics, history, geography, and economy.

Clément Rodzielski,"These photographs are installation shots of the exhibition De A à B, de B à P at Bielefelder Kunstverein (13 November 2010-30 January 2011). There, Clément Rodzielski had chosen to exhibit the series called Miroirs noirs (Black Mirrors, black and white abstract screen prints) which is emblematic of his work. The piece of painted wood was not shown to the public; it moves and invests the space enigmatically. On the other hand, the painting which dialogues with the works on the wall and serves as a yardstick in space has now disappeared.

Bettina Pousttchi,"For Bettina Poutsttchi’s large-format, site-specific photographic work Echo (2009–10), the four exterior walls of the Temporäre Kunsthalle Berlin were covered with a digitally edited collage of archival images of the glass-and-steel facade of the Palast der Republik (Palace of the Republic), which had once been located nearby. That milestone of late East European modernism was completed in 1976. It served as the seat for the Volkskammer—the parliament of the German Democratic Republic (GDR). After the fall of the Berlin Wall, the building lost its political purpose and was used for cultural initiatives. After a long political discussion, the building was demolished in 2009 to make room for the reconstruction of Berlin’s eighteenth-century Stadtschloss (City castle). With the aid of photography, Bettina Pousttchi rebuilt the Palace of the Republic, the historically important building in the immediate vicinity of the demolition site, thus raising questions of the eternal cycle of catastrophe, destruction, and reconstruction in Berlin.  Echo is a photographic work of an altered reality that is implemented in public space. The series of twenty-four color photographs was taken during the six-month presentation of Echo, offering a diverse portrait of this installation in the middle of the iconic buildings that surround it. With Echo, the artist altered the physical reality of the Berlin Schlossplatz through photographic means. By photographing it, she achieves another reality that crosses between architecture, sculpture, and photography in a very exciting way. A selection of the Echo photos were shown in her solo show at the Kunsthalle Basel in 2011. The proposal is to purchase a pair of photos showing the building at different times of the year and looking in different directions evoking different aspects of temporality and politics through the seasons and architecture.","In recent years Bettina Pousttchi’s work has dealt with themes related to memory, time and history and she is particularly interested in the consequences of the fall of the Berlin Wall. She makes sculpture, frequently made from crowd control barriers, video installations and photographs. She describes her work as coming out of photography.

Ciprian Muresan,"Ciprian Muresan asked a group of protagonists to wear a monk’s robe and copy a certain number of artworks and texts from exhibition catalogues. Here it is no longer the Bible that is reproduced but works by Malevich, Mondrian, Beuys, Duchamp. These artists represent a certain form of utopia in art and are themselves quasi-mythical figures. The fact that they are copying these works from a catalogue reproducing works by Elaine Sturtevant who in turn has appropriated work by other artists (mostly works made by men) creates an even greater distancing in the actions of these copying monks.  The authenticity of the artist’s gesture defended by Modernism is rejected and recalls the status of the artist during the Communist era. This also considers this post-Communist era in which artists easily enter the economic system of the art market in today’s globalized world and proposes an ironic comment on the diffusion of images in this internet age. Rather like in the work by Mladen Stilinovic, this is acts as an interrogation on the loss of meaning of certain icons in Western art, a questioning of the negative and positive consequences of a meticulous repetition of the past.","Ciprian Muresan appropriates historical, political, social and cultural (essentially artistic, literary and cinematographic) references which he re-contextualizes. He analyzes the mechanisms de diffusion of culture, the ambivalent relations between the memory of recent history and the experience of current realities, as well as the relations between political power, religious power and civil society. With simple gestures, themes and methods borrowed from popular culture, he tackles art in an expiatory manner, returning importance to personal expression and experience. Ciprian Muresan belongs to the generation after the fall of the former Communist regime who deal the aftermath of political and social history of his country, in a post-conceptual mode, without necessarily inscribing it within the traditional East/West opposition. Instead, on the contrary, he approaches this history as an integral part of a larger whole, and is interested in questions linked to the disturbances in contemporary society following the declining of Modernist utopias and in the impact of new technologies on our visual culture.

The fact that they are copying these works from a catalogue reproducing works by Elaine Sturtevant who in turn has appropriated work by other artists (mostly works made by men) creates an even greater distancing in the actions of these copying monks.  The authenticity of the artist’s gesture defended by Modernism is rejected and recalls the status of the artist during the Communist era. This also considers this post-Communist era in which artists easily enter the economic system of the art market in today’s globalized world and proposes an ironic comment on the diffusion of images in this internet age. Rather like in the work by Mladen Stilinovic, this is acts as an interrogation on the loss of meaning of certain icons in Western art, a questioning of the negative and positive consequences of a meticulous repetition of the past.. Ciprian Muresan appropriates historical, political, social and cultural (essentially artistic, literary and cinematographic) references which he re-contextualizes. He analyzes the mechanisms de diffusion of culture, the ambivalent relations between the memory of recent history and the experience of current realities, as well as the relations between political power, religious power and civil society. With simple gestures, themes and methods borrowed from popular culture, he tackles art in an expiatory manner, returning importance to personal expression and experience. Ciprian Muresan belongs to the generation after the fall of the former Communist regime who deal the aftermath of political and social history of his country, in a post-conceptual mode, without necessarily inscribing it within the traditional East/West opposition. Instead, on the contrary, he approaches this history as an integral part of a larger whole, and is interested in questions linked to the disturbances in contemporary society following the declining of Modernist utopias and in the impact of new technologies on our visual culture.  Ciprian Muresan was born in 1977 in Cluj, Romania. He lives and works in Cluj, Romania..

Lydia Gifford,"Lydia Gifford composes her work between pictorial expression and its inscription within an exhibition space. This particular approach implies the performative aspect of her in situ painting. The artist takes the entire environment into consideration from the canvas to the exhibition walls. Time and attention are required to allow the subtleties of the work to reveal themselves in all their complexities in order to find a focal distance which is appropriate to experience the composition. A white wall, a vibrant canvas, disparate elements as  punctuation, and the pictorial gesture that continue on the wall on which it becomes inscribed in an echo with the canvas. She explains that: “There is a subtle balance between impulse and action. Actions leave traces, painting always initially carries the mark of the body, of an explosive gesture.” Intimate and played out in the exhibition space, the artist’s work endangers its own apparatus on the occasion of every presentation and thus renews the viewpoints in a perpetual dialogue between the work, the place and the audience.  Warder is on the limit of achievement and creates a tension with the exhibition space that fundamentally participates in its evolution. The artist proposes an intimate sensory experience by drawing attention to the vibratile nature of the context and the marking of her gesture. She states that in her work: “Painting allows me to transpose boundaries”. In the painting tradition that Gifford responds to Turner’s works are haunted by fog which diffuses light: she brings this up to date with her incisive question of defining a territory to cultivate.

Doug Aitken,"The version of Frontier acquired by the Kadist Collection consists of a single-channel video, adapted from the monumental installation and performance that Aitken presented in Rome, by the Tiber River, in 2009.

These notions are reinforced by two key elements in the film: its protagonist, the iconic West Coast artist Ed Ruscha, and its reference to the cinematic and the experience of the movie theater. The film is structured as a journey in time, from day to night.

The artist narrates the many projects he has completed or which are in progress beyond the gallery walls. It is beyond the gallery where Deller is at his most effective and where his art reaches out to and into people’s lives. The tape slide presentation shows the extensive range of Deller’s work. On one level it is documentation, on another level it is a work that investigates the nature of a work of art – is a social project a work of art? When does documentation become art? Can we accept the artist’s commentary at face value?  The artist acts as a historian or archivist of his own work but presents it in such a way that the archive is the work of art itself. Deller is at one and the same time artist, curator and cultural historian interested in the way popular culture and fine art abut each other. His art has the capacity to affect directly people’s lives by inserting it into the community and requiring the community’s participation.","Jeremy Deller is one of the leading British artists working in film and making projects that grow out of an interest in vox pop, giving vent to the views of ordinary people and focusing on ordinary people’s lives. He seeks the involvement of the common man in the making of his work as well as focusing on events that have had a major impact on people’s lives. His most famous piece is a film called the Battle of Orgreave (2001) in which he produced and filmed a reenactment of an infamous confrontation between striking miners and the police force during the fateful miners’ strike that took place during Margaret Thatcher’s first term in office in 1984. In Deller’s restaging many of the participants were miners and policemen who had been present at the original event. Prior to that in 1996 Deller produced a work called Acid Brass for which he commissioned a brass band from the northern community of Stockport that would normally play traditional and often Christian songs, to play acid house and techno rock tunes. Brass Bands were closely associated with the collieries that were under threat from the conservative government’s closure of the coalmines. For Deller the Miners’ strike and the rise of acid house music were the two most significant events of the period and he brought them together in this one piece. It is the mixing of traditions that makes his work so compelling. Deller went on to win the Turner Prize in 2004 and has continued to make works which investigate the interface between art and popular culture, normally with a strong political and social aspect, although often the works are funny and witty.

Zhou Tao,"To realize « After Reality », Zhou Tao started to shoot in Guangzhou and arrived with a first editing of his film for his Parisian residency. From China, he brought back images of the luxuriant vegetation and of Dragon boat rowers in training. First, Tao decided to play their role, overseeing their movements that could inspire his performances.  Arriving in Paris, the confrontation was total. Chinese and Europeans share different notions of gardens and landscapes. And this was something very new for him to capture in this film. Tao worked to incorporate images shot in Paris to his previous editing, working on the idea of continuity in between spaces. He used the notion of “geometrical editing” to translate his aim to create an invisible space formed by images filmed in Guangzhou and in Paris.  He creates a third space, that of the film. As if he were classifying the different possible natural spaces inside urban zones, Tao portrays nature and man’s relation to it (being overwhelmed by it, taking care of it, staying alive thanks to its resources). Entitled “After Reality”, the film confronts us to a kind of unhistorical time, after urbanization and its planning, in which certain gestures of survival remain. Nature here seems to be the only rule to follow and weather conditions have the real power.","There is no single entry to the practice of Zhou Tao, who denies the existence of any singular or real narrative or space.

Yael Bartana,"Yael Bartana’s video work A Declaration was shot in southern Tel Aviv, on the visible border between that city and Jaffa. It begins with the sound of waves and the image of the Israeli flag that fills the entire screen. This is followed by the whirring sounds of a helicopter. A young man in a white undershirt rows a boat carrying an olive tree in its place. With her camera work Bartana seems to flirt with 1930s Jewish National Fund (JNF) propaganda photography on the one hand, and with Leni Riefenstahl’s photographic technique, like the use of soft focus that distorts the perspective and vanishing point, on the other, A Declaration already attests to the action itself: on Andromeda’s Rock, Bartana replaces the Israeli flag with an olive tree. While this is indeed an act performed in a media context, it nevertheless takes place in the sphere of Israeli reality.  (exh.cat. Kunstverein in Hamburg, Hatje Cantz, 2007, p. 93)","The work of Yael Bartana investigates the imagination and imagery of identity and the politics of national memory and identity. Her interest in understanding and examining national statehood stems from being born in Israel, and being surrounded by the perpetual production of collective national identity. After completing her studies, Bartana undertook what she called ‘amateur anthropological’ research into ritual and myth making to take a critical perspective towards her own history and nationality.

It begins with the sound of waves and the image of the Israeli flag that fills the entire screen. This is followed by the whirring sounds of a helicopter. A young man in a white undershirt rows a boat carrying an olive tree in its place. With her camera work Bartana seems to flirt with 1930s Jewish National Fund (JNF) propaganda photography on the one hand, and with Leni Riefenstahl’s photographic technique, like the use of soft focus that distorts the perspective and vanishing point, on the other, A Declaration already attests to the action itself: on Andromeda’s Rock, Bartana replaces the Israeli flag with an olive tree. While this is indeed an act performed in a media context, it nevertheless takes place in the sphere of Israeli reality.  (exh.cat. Kunstverein in Hamburg, Hatje Cantz, 2007, p. 93). The work of Yael Bartana investigates the imagination and imagery of identity and the politics of national memory and identity. Her interest in understanding and examining national statehood stems from being born in Israel, and being surrounded by the perpetual production of collective national identity. After completing her studies, Bartana undertook what she called ‘amateur anthropological’ research into ritual and myth making to take a critical perspective towards her own history and nationality. As a result of her politically charged practice that often deals with Jewish identity in Israel and abroad, she has garnered significant criticism, notably being labeled as anti-Zionist and a self-hating Jew.

Mark Leckey,"In Made In Heaven, we are face to face with a sculptural apparition, a divine visitation in the artist’s studio. It isn’t just any object, but an iconic sculpture of the end of the 20th century: Jeff Koons’ Bunny.  One key question in this work is of course the construction of images, but there is also the question of sculpture, of the passage from two-dimensionality to three-dimensionality. The reason for using the moving image, above all theoretical, is also part of interrogation regarding the material construction of images. For this film, he remakes Koons’s sculpture in order to be able to experiment himself in his studio. One can discern the contours of his studio and sometimes his presence in a lot of his videos. With reference to Marcel Duchamp, he wants to create the ultimate Machine Célibataire (Bachelor Machine), by producing nothing other than itself in reference to the self- reflexivity of Pop.  The Bunny is a sculptural form in space which also produces images. It is obvious that we are in an image which is entirely constructed since it is impossible to film the object without having, at a certain point, the reflection of the camera on the steel surface. Mark Leckey is interested in the possibilities of new technologies and places at the heart of his practice the revelation of a sensitive and quasi-magical world. The film loop (which only lasts 2mn) places the spectator in a completely hypnotic state.","Mark Leckey became know in the 1990s with a cult film Fiorucci Made Me Hardcore about English clubs since the early 1970s. Rather like Jeremy Deller, his work at the time was a mixture of Pop culture and counter-culture. In fact a constant in his work is an interest in the icons of our visual culture. In Felix Gets Broadcasted, he became interested in Felix The Cat who was first of all present at the beginning of the 20th century in over 250 newspapers and was the first character to benefit from TV transmission in 1928 in New York. This is the story of a cartoon hero and his successful conversion from cinema to the written press and then to TV, before being integrated into the art system.

Like all of Djurberg’s work, the film is very painterly, bridging the gap between film, sculpture and painting. She has stated that the writings of Georges Bataille, that she encountered as a student, made an impact on her, as the scatological and anxious nature of her work attests.

When you are not allowed to do something, you become attracted to it.” Quoted in “Germano Celant – Nathalie Djurberg”, in Nathalie Djurberg. Turn Into Me, Milan, Fondazione Prada, 2008, p. 193.. In the late 1990s, Nathalie Djurberg started to work with Super 8 film, then video, staging plasticine models or puppets. Her animations are short narratives, fairy tales or nightmares for adults in cynical representations of relations between humans and animals. Reminiscent of the Czech Surrealist Jan Svankmajer’s clay animation films, as well as more recent work by Claes Oldenburg or Paul McCarthy, they push the boundaries of what is sacrilegious in art, eroticism and cinema. Glass or ceramic sculptures and installations add actual object-hood to her cartoon-like creations. The accompanying music is generally by Hans Berg.“Immersion in the dark vortex where things are carnal and sexual, humiliating and shameful, coagulated as exemplars of familial and erotic relationships of subjection, animalism and irreverence, is the procedure Nathalie Djurberg adopts to show the despoliation process experienced by the individual”. Germano Celant, Nathalie Djurberg. Turn Into Me, Milan, Fondazione Prada, 2008, p. 12-13.     Nathalie Djurberg was born in 1978 in Lysekil, Sweden. Lives and works in Berlin, Germany..

Dennis Adams,"The video Make down is a 34 minute sequence shot that shows the artist removing make-up in front of a mirror. The peculiarity of the scene consists in two symbolic details: first, the make-up itself, covering his face, hair and torso – a thick kaki layer, reminding of military camouflage – and second, the paper used to remove the make-up – black and white prints of stills taken from Gillo Pontecorvo’s 1965 film, “La bataille d’Alger”  ( The Battle of Algiers). These still images put together recreate a sequence in which a young Algerian woman takes off her veil and puts on Western make-up. This disguise will help her pass the border and place a bomb in the French area of Algiers. Censured in France when it came out, the movie combines history and feminist activism; it may also be reinterpreted today in relation to the recent history of terrorism. The video goes with an installation: a vitrine enclosing the 96 prints soiled by the make-up, the remains of the artist’s performance, as if it were a reliquary. Compared to the terrorist’s gesture, the action is performed backwards by the artist, which could suggest the impossibility of having a unique reading of history.","Since 1998, through site specific works, often in public spaces, or video works, Dennis Adams focuses on ambiguous characters, condemned by our recent history,  revealing traumas or collective amnesia phenomena.

The 16 ft long tableau confronts the viewer with a seemingly paradisiacal scene: a tropical deserted island with white sands and blooming trees appears to be a coveted destination. However the scene quickly turns into a dystopian image, once one pays attention to the small details camouflaged inside it: an erupting volcano or a dead bird. Biernoff places a pair of binoculars in front of the painting to reinforce this idea. Looking through their fake mdf lenses, the painted landscape is rendered blurry. The whole scene acts up as the backdrop of a theater act and the prop quality of its elements suggests a certain lightness associated with utopian dreams.","Elisheva Biernoff’s work engages and reconsiders the tradition of painting in an interesting way, often taking source material from media or recreating photographs through a careful trompe d’oeil technique.

The whole scene acts up as the backdrop of a theater act and the prop quality of its elements suggests a certain lightness associated with utopian dreams.. Elisheva Biernoff’s work engages and reconsiders the tradition of painting in an interesting way, often taking source material from media or recreating photographs through a careful trompe d’oeil technique. Thus, her work engages in the discussion of re-representation through painting, not aiming to portray any given reality faithfully but rather as the ideal way to engage with a subject matter that explores the intersection between myths, fictions and fantasies. In some cases, her works also address particular ecological concerns..

Felipe Arturo,"Defined as entropy, the second law of thermodynamics proposes that energy is more easily dispersed than it is concentrated. One basic illustration of entropy is to imagine white and black sand: once mixed together, it is highly unlikely that the contrasting grains of sand can be separated and restored to their original distinct color groups. Arturo’s Trópico Entrópico (Entropic Tropics, 2012) considers the colonization of the American continent as a similarly irreversible process of cultural entropy. His inspiration derives from a place near Manaus in the Brazilian Amazon, where the Black River meets with the sandy-colored Solimões River, producing a river of two colors that extends over ten kilometers. In the late nineteenth century, the Brazilian rubber barons decided to commemorate this impressive natural phenomenon by covering the main square of Manaus with a design of black-and-white waveforms made from stones. The square is known as the Encontro das aguas (Meeting of the Waters). Decades later, Roberto Burle Marx used this same pattern in his famous Copacabana walkway in Rio de Janeiro. Since then, the design has spread across the continent to Lima, Bogotá, Cali, and beyond. Trópico entrópico uses this pattern to produce entropy in the exhibition space. Sugar, the material used, signifies one of many economic motivators for colonialism. Visitors are invited to collectively dissolve this modern design by walking on the brown and white sugar, and participating in its entropic mixing.","Felipe Arturo considers elements from urbanism, architecture, and art in relation to politics, history, geography, and economy.

Yoshua Okón,"Canned Laughter was Okón’s response to an invitation from Ciudad Juárez that asked artists to create works based on their experience in the city. Okón focuses on Ciudad Juárez as a site for many “maquiladoras”—factories— and on its role within the global context. Canned Laughter is a detailed construction of Bergson, a fictitious factory that produces canned laughter for sitcoms. For it, dozens of ex-maquiladora workers were hired both as part of the research process (maquiladoras are highly secretive and it is very hard to know what happens inside) and as actors.

Okón focuses on Ciudad Juárez as a site for many “maquiladoras”—factories— and on its role within the global context. Canned Laughter is a detailed construction of Bergson, a fictitious factory that produces canned laughter for sitcoms. For it, dozens of ex-maquiladora workers were hired both as part of the research process (maquiladoras are highly secretive and it is very hard to know what happens inside) and as actors.
