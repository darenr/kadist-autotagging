"Jennifer Allora, Guillermo Calzadilla","This series of photographs is part of the body of work Allora & Calzadilla made regarding the situation in Vieques, an island off the mainland of Puerto Rico used for the 60 years by the U.S Military and NATO forces to practice military bombing exercises. In 2000, they began a collaboration with the local activists to make the campaign more visible. Having added cast rubber reliefs of their slogans and designs to the soles of their shoes, the activists stamped their protest on the reclaimed land. By slightly manipulating everyday objects to become communication tools, Allora & Calzadilla had created “mobile print-making machines” (Yates McKee, October 133, Summer 2010). They then photographed the ephemeral aftermath of these mark-making actions.  Like graffitied walls, the details of these impressions on sandy grounds are landscapes of dissent, willing the transition of propriety back to the inhabitants. In Land Mark #12, numerous footsteps with long statements stamp their resentment in different confused orientations. Such a beach scene might at first misleadingly be associated with a playful holiday snap. The fragility, uncertainty and relentlessness of this struggle is poetically summarized in this close-up of meaningful site-specific expression. The artists wrote: “How is land differentiated from other land by the way it is marked? Who decides what is worth preserving and what should be destroyed? What are the strategies for reclaiming marked land? How does one articulate an ethics and politics of land use?” (in Land Mark, de Tokyo, Paris, 2006).","Jennifer Allora and Guillermo Calzadilla comprise the artistic duo Allora & Calzadilla.

The affects that emerge in the piece are characterized by a sense of movement between pain and hope, and a work of association between cancer and expectancy.

Federico Herrero,"Federico Herrero’s energetic paintings reflect his experiences on the streets of his native San José, Costa Rica, and in the surrounding tropical landscape. Rooted in Central American folklore, politics, and culture, his works often move beyond the canvas onto the wall or into the streets. In Árbol y Pelicao (Tree and Pelican, 2009), a tree with cartoonlike creatures drawn in pen beside it emerges from a field of bright swaths of color. This imagined landscape fuses abstract painting and graffiti art. Despite the roar of colors, the scene is peaceful—a vision of urbanity and nature coexisting in harmony.","Federico Herrero makes colorful paintings, often on walls and as murals. Whether depicting recognizable objects or more generally abstract, his paintings have a consistent quality of rounded shapes, wobbling fields of color, and all-over markings. Herrero’s works are full of energy and life, hovering somewhere between painted-over graffiti and painterly abstraction.

Brenna Youngblood,"Brenna Youngblood’s chromogenic print Red Door (2007) is representative of the artist’s interest in conceptual photography; she also works in multimedia collage and assemblage, drawing imagery from the everyday and giving new meanings to seemingly mundane objects and places. The image of a red door inspires a tension between potential meaning and purposeful ambiguity, leaving the viewer to wonder about her formal decisions. The color red on a door is often used to symbolize good luck, and in almost every culture, means “welcome.” Some say a red door was a sign of a safe house on the Underground Railroad.","Brenna Youngblood’s images reflect the experiences of a working-class woman of color growing up in Central California and eventually landing in Los Angeles. Ironically, her photo collages, assemblages, and paintings have often been compared to the work of Robert Rauschenberg or Richard Prince, but they are closer in spirit with more contemporary artists like Mark Bradford. Youngblood’s work captures a kind of social architecture, that is, an out-of-focus zone where portraits of people become landscapes and buildings become familiar characters.
