"Jennifer Allora, Guillermo Calzadilla","This series of photographs is part of the body of work Allora & Calzadilla made regarding the situation in Vieques, an island off the mainland of Puerto Rico used for the 60 years by the U.S Military and NATO forces to practice military bombing exercises. In 2000, they began a collaboration with the local activists to make the campaign more visible. Having added cast rubber reliefs of their slogans and designs to the soles of their shoes, the activists stamped their protest on the reclaimed land. By slightly manipulating everyday objects to become communication tools, Allora & Calzadilla had created “mobile print-making machines” (Yates McKee, October 133, Summer 2010). They then photographed the ephemeral aftermath of these mark-making actions.  Like graffitied walls, the details of these impressions on sandy grounds are landscapes of dissent, willing the transition of propriety back to the inhabitants. In Land Mark #12, numerous footsteps with long statements stamp their resentment in different confused orientations. Such a beach scene might at first misleadingly be associated with a playful holiday snap. The fragility, uncertainty and relentlessness of this struggle is poetically summarized in this close-up of meaningful site-specific expression. The artists wrote: “How is land differentiated from other land by the way it is marked? Who decides what is worth preserving and what should be destroyed? What are the strategies for reclaiming marked land? How does one articulate an ethics and politics of land use?” (in Land Mark, de Tokyo, Paris, 2006).","Jennifer Allora and Guillermo Calzadilla comprise the artistic duo Allora & Calzadilla. Their work often takes the form of performances, installations, and sound pieces that refer to sociopolitical phenomena and history. Forms from these spheres of life—an overturned tank, a treadmill, a piano—are displaced and spliced together in new configurations, often with performers or viewers engaging with these material segments of the world.",Land Mark (Foot Prints) #12,Americas,"['land.n.01', 'tag.v.01', 'mark.n.01', 'militant.n.01', 'protest.n.01', 'place.n.06', 'statement.n.01', 'series.n.01 photograph.n.01', 'evidence.n.01', 'destroy.v.01', 'collaboration.n.01', 'struggle.n.01', 'scheme.n.01', 'machine.n.01', 'ephemeral.s.01', 'beach.n.01', 'politics.n.01', 'local.a.01', 'playful.a.01', 'passage.n.01', 'island.n.01', 'military.a.01', 'expression.n.01', 'design.n.01', 'tool.n.01']","['demobilization.n.01', 'landscape.n.03', 'footprint.n.02', 'intervention.n.01', 'documentation.n.01', 'trace.n.02']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/img-34.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/img-34-300x200.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/land-mark-foot-prints-12/,"['Cultural/4.920751633986928', 'Politics/2.467760180995475', 'Society/1.75']","['Cultural', 'Politics', 'Society']",9.138511814982403,"['Arts/4.0318627450980395', 'Inequality/1.6985294117647058', 'Land/1.0']","['Arts', 'Inequality', 'Land']",6.730392156862745,"['Cultural/21.695151743681162', 'Politics/10.98035312640576', 'Society/8.793595602883528']","['Cultural', 'Politics', 'Society']",41.46910047297045,"['Arts/5.534640522875817', 'Technology/4.580882352941177', 'Land/4.283516483516483']","['Arts', 'Technology', 'Land']",14.399039359333475,1.0,0.6666666666666666
Gabriel Kuri,"Gabriel Kuri has created a series of works in which he juxtaposes perennial and ephemeral materials. Untitled (Ticket Roll) belongs to this group of sculptures and consists of three smooth ornate marble elements and a roll of public transport tickets. The artist poetically associates finesse and fragility as in a number of these works. Here the line of the ticket roll, partly unraveled, is held down by the balancing marble elements thus creating an interdependence between elements de different natures. Gabriel Kuri’s sculptural work involves a narrative through various elements from daily life resulting from specific areas of our contemporary social structures : tickets, banknotes, bills, credit cards, toiletry samples from hotels…","Gabriel Kuri works from repurposed natural, industrial, and mass-produced objects and materials including soda cans, shopping bags, receipts, insulation foam, shells, and magazines.

Renee Rhodes,"The artist writes about her work: “There is an endless desire to know what we look like from outer space and many of us have evolved into a species that exists across the disorienting spaces and timeframes of virtuality. Within my current work, dance and simple movement scores act as a language for simultaneously collecting, mapping and producing volumes of information and knowledge. Moving makes a map and performing is observation. Digital mediations translate bodies into uncanny organisms and minimal dances become distant accumulations of pixelated information. Entanglements between human physicality, technology and natural systems are imagined through a playful aesthetics of information. As every last body and landscape is mapped and measured, through rigorous technologies of ever increasing distance, I look for the newly emerging territories that mineralize at the intersections of the virtual and the physical. These are the territories that we live in, archived in the memory drives of muscles, or through endlessly shifting choreographies of information.”","Renée Rhodes grew up amidst the fantasy and rigor that is the world of classical ballet.

Fiamma Montezemolo,"Montemozolo writes of the work: “Fireflies is the result of a sudden event—and its transformation/translation into an art work—that erupts within a life, altering its flow, suspending it, creating a momentary intensity and deviation of the flow, channeling it somewhere unexpected. This unforeseen deviation is dissected in terms of affects in the time frame of 5 minutes. The affects that emerge in the piece are characterized by a sense of movement between pain and hope, and a work of association between cancer and expectancy. The concept of resistance and fireflies is taken from [Georges] Didi-Huberman’s work on the political relevance of the survival of fireflies as a metaphor for the contemporary importance of an intermittent resistance opposed to an inoperable, redemptive, absolute one.”","Born in Rome, Fiamma Montezemolo is both a cultural anthropologist (PhD, University of Naples)  and an artist (MFA, San Francisco Art Institute). Not surprisingly then, she situates her art practice as a critical response to the “ethnographic turn” that was prevalent in contemporary art during the 1990s. In addition to ethnography—a research method adopted as a “medium” by many artists—Montezemolo works with various media including installation, cartography, video, digital photography, industrial materials, performance, and archival documents.

Mladen Stilinovic,"The Exploitation of the Dead cycle is composed of a very large number of elements which the artist reorganizes differently every time. The installation is presented like a “parade of objects”, with images whose historical role has been suspended or their meaning has changed. The references have become lost, through repetition the works have become banal. One can find copies of Suprematist or Social Realist paintings, collages, photographs of political meetings, cemeteries or other memorials. We are confronted with the obsolescence of signs. Colors like red and black have also lost their meaning.  Exploitation of the Dead concerns today’s religious or ideological ideas which are only extensions of religions and ideologies of the past and definitively dead. Mladen Stilinovic insists that: “If death has to be exploited, this is a violent act and we need to weigh up the consequences.” Collective rituals are central since they evoke a certain collective emotion which can’t quite be attained through signs and colors. This work is a way to think about painting but also the modalities of its exhibition. There is also this question of the copy. Why and how do we copy things? What do we learn through repetition ? About loss of integrity ?","Mladen Stilinovic’s work is based on social and political critique, with a healthy dose of irony. He was part of Grupa šestorice autora (Group of Six Authors), active in Zagreb between 1975 and 1979. He also ran the Extended Media Gallery from 1981 to 1991. His work is deeply rooted in the rites that reveal the interdependence of private and public spheres. He is particularly interested in the interaction between visual and linguistic signs as well as in the mechanisms of deconstruction in language. His polymorphic approach finds varied manifestations from collages, installations, photographs, books, performances, actions in public space as well as participations in collective actions.

Brenna Youngblood,"Brenna Youngblood’s chromogenic print Red Door (2007) is representative of the artist’s interest in conceptual photography; she also works in multimedia collage and assemblage, drawing imagery from the everyday and giving new meanings to seemingly mundane objects and places.

Ironically, her photo collages, assemblages, and paintings have often been compared to the work of Robert Rauschenberg or Richard Prince, but they are closer in spirit with more contemporary artists like Mark Bradford.

Francis Alÿs,,"Trained as an architect, Alÿs turned to a visual arts based practice in the early 1990s as a more immediate, direct, and effective way of exploring issues related to urbanization, to the ordering and signification of urban space and to the semiotics of its use. His work initiates with a simple action, either by him or others, which is then documented in a range of media. Alÿs explores subjects such as modernizing programs in Latin America and border zones in areas of conflict, often asking about the relevance of poetic acts in politicized situations. Documentation is central to his practice as well as painting, drawing, and video. In his work, When Faith Moves Mountains (2002) made in collaboration with Mexican critic Cuauhtemoc Medina, Alÿs recruited 500 volunteers outside of Lima, Peru. Each person moved a shovel full of sand one step at a time form one side of a dune to the other, and together they moved the entire geographical location of the dune by a few inches.

Francis Alÿs,,"Trained as an architect, Alÿs turned to a visual arts based practice in the early 1990s as a more immediate, direct, and effective way of exploring issues related to urbanization, to the ordering and signification of urban space and to the semiotics of its use. His work initiates with a simple action, either by him or others, which is then documented in a range of media. Alÿs explores subjects such as modernizing programs in Latin America and border zones in areas of conflict, often asking about the relevance of poetic acts in politicized situations. Documentation is central to his practice as well as painting, drawing, and video. In his work, When Faith Moves Mountains (2002) made in collaboration with Mexican critic Cuauhtemoc Medina, Alÿs recruited 500 volunteers outside of Lima, Peru. Each person moved a shovel full of sand one step at a time form one side of a dune to the other, and together they moved the entire geographical location of the dune by a few inches.

Gabriel Orozco,"Gabriel Orozco often documents found situations in the natural or urban landscape. He travels armed with his camera and insightfully captures scenes of the everyday that other people might ignore. Perro en Tlalpan (Dog in Tlalpan, 1992) is a photograph of a dog regally perched under an industrial shelter in the borough of Tlalpan in Mexico City. The shelter’s concrete form seems to reference monuments such as the Mesoamerican pyramids in Teotihuacan, not far from the city, thereby likening the dog in a humorous way to some kind of posed sacred creature.","Gabriel Orozco could be described as a traveler-artist, without a fixed studio. He works following contexts and produces work that flows. “Special Service” (1997) is a collage on a plane ticket, and indicates nomadism, between territories. The artist, who is the son of muralist Mario Orozco Riviera, questions the boundaries of his artistic identity in Mexico. In “Crazy tourist” (1991), Orozco creates a situation with oranges in the Brazilian market tables in a desert. The artist uses objects or “poor” situations, found in the everyday landscape, natural or urban. By their division, their juxtaposition, or collage, inventing semantic or sensitive scenarios, always surprising, sometimes humorous and sometimes lyrical … The sculptural practice of the artist, inseparable from his drawings, photographs, or films, invents relationships of space, and disrupts our perception of objects. Such is the case of “Yielding Stone” (1992), a photo of a plasticine ball, the weight of the artist, rolled through the streets of New York. Gabriel Orozco was born in 1962 in Jalapa, Mexico.

Early in his career he made traditional, non-realistic, colorful, large-scale paintings that depicted everyday objects. Many of these took a somewhat critical tone that specifically addressed the cultural and societal dilemmas facing Brazil and its contemporary citizenry. He moved on to making sewn assemblages made out of materials such as buttons, stones, cloth, canvas, copper wire, and thread.

Gregory Crewdson,"Forest Gathering N.2 is part of the series of photographs Beneath the Roses (2003-2005) where anonymous townscapes, forest clearings and broad, desolate streets are revealed as sites of mystery and wonder; similarly, ostensibly banal interiors become the staging grounds for strange human scenarios. These scenes are tangibly atmospheric, visually alluring and often deeply disquieting. Never anchored precisely in time or place, these and the other narratives of Beneath the Roses are rather located in the dystopic landscape of the anxious American imagination. Crewdson’s process and approach are patently cinematic. This series took shape over the course of three years in collaboration with a full production team.  His projects are made both on studio soundstages and on location in various small towns. After the photograph is taken, Crewdson continues his obsessive process in post-production, using state-of-the-art digital compositing and special effects. And in the end – like film at its best – Crewdson’s fictions, elaborately staged and plotted though they may be, convey an experience that is intensely real.","Gregory Crewdson works within a photographic tradition that combines the documentary style of William Eggleston and Walker Evans with the dream-like vision of filmmakers such as Stephen Spielberg and David Lynch. Crewdson’s method is equally filmic, building elaborate sets to take pictures of extraordinary detail and narrative portent. When he was ten, Crewdson’s father, a psychoanalyst, took him to see a Diane Arbus exhibition at MoMA, an early aesthetic experience that informed his decision to become a photographer. Crewdson’s everyday scenes with charged, surreal moods hint at the longings and malaise of suburban America. The artist uses “the limitations of a photograph in terms of narrative capacity to have an image that is frozen in time, where there’s no before or after” and has turned that restriction into a unique strength.Gregory Crewdson was born in New York in 1962.

Michael Craig-Martin,,"Michael Craig-Martin studied fine art at Yale University returning to Europe in the mid-1960s and becoming one of the key figures in the first generation of British conceptual artists. He was a professor at Goldsmith’s College from 1974–88 and 1994–2000, where he remained a powerful influence on the emerging British artists. His early work made deliberate reference to the American artists he most admired, such as Donald Judd, Jasper Johns and Robert Morris. Although he was particularly affected by Minimalism and used ordinary household materials in his sculptures, playing against the logic of his sources. In the early 1970s, he exhibited his now seminal piece An Oak Tree, consisting of a glass of water standing on a shelf attached to the gallery wall. In the accompanying text, he asked himself questions to assert that the glass was in fact an oak tree.  Craig-Martin continued working in various forms, always maintaining an elegant restraint and conceptual clarity. During the 1990s the focus of his work shifted decisively to painting, with the same range of boldly outlined motifs and luridly vivid color schemes in unexpected (and at times apparently arbitrary) combinations applied both to works on canvas, and to increasingly complex installations of wall paintings.",Untitled (violet),Europe,[],"['minimalism.n.01', 'delineation.n.02', 'mundane.s.02', 'fork.n.01', 'espresso_maker.n.01', 'violet.n.02']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/michael_craig-martin_-_untitled.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/michael_craig-martin_-_untitled-239x300.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/untitled-violet/,['Cultural/3.593954248366013'],['Cultural'],3.593954248366013,"['Design/1.7777777777777777', 'Arts/0.9411764705882353', 'Media/0.875']","['Design', 'Arts', 'Media']",3.593954248366013,[],[],0.0,[],[],0.0,,
Maria Bussman,"The drawing “Heidegger’s Cabin” (2005) is inspired by Martin Heidegger’s essay, “The Origin of the Work of Art.” During the artist’s stay in a high alpine area, near a lake reservoir, Bussmann related the landscape in her surroundings to her reading of Heidegger’s terms on the work of art and the meaning of a “thing.” In attempt to link spiritual heights to natural heights, Bussmann metaphorically relates the subjects of being and truth to a hiking path, and its different degrees of challenge and risk. In the drawings rather than finding the optimal path to reach ultimate meaning and materialization, Bussmann never arrives at “Heidegger’s Cabin,” and instead is led off the beaten track to areas she never discovered before. Upon her return from the mountains in 2004 and 2005, she continued to develop the series, leading up to 20 drawings on handmade paper that attempt to problematize Heidegger’s theory on artworks as “things” as bearers of traits, “things” confronting the world of perception, and “things” as formed matter.","Maria Bussmann’s works represent an insistent attempt to fathom the epistemological quality of her medium, drawing. For the artist, drawing is the most direct form of artistic expression, both as a medium of analysis and of communication.  Her work traditionally grows out of her relationship to reading and the generative force of philosophy and literature, as well as personal references such as temporary sites of residence. Authors that have inspired her work include philosophers Heidegger, Merleau-Ponty, Wittgenstein and Apuleius. Her drawings, at times exhibited as scrolls, exist as open-ended commentaries and annotations to philosophical thinking rather than illustrations of readings or experiences. While reading and thinking, the artist transfers visual ideas that develop in her mind into a two-dimensional space making the drawing expansive. In a transformational process, individual pictorial elements appear like encoded emblems, resulting in a rich textual interwoven fabric. The result is a bulk of sketches made into series around her interpretations of philosophical strands or subjects of reference.  Maria Bussmann was born in 1966 in Würzburg (Germany). Having studied at the Academies of Fine Art in Nuremberg and Vienna, she graduated in philosophy and cultural studies from Vienna University.

Zarina Bhimji,"Born in Uganda of Indian descent, Bhimji has lived in London after her family sought refuge from the regime of Idi Amin who compulsorily expelled all Asians from Uganda. Her recent work has been concerned with revisiting the country of her childhood and engaging with the experience of exile, political and social destruction, and deprivation. This photograph, which belongs to the series “Love”, was shot by Bhimji during her journey in Uganda in 2001, but was only edited in 2006. It depicts Entebbe airport, the site of evacuation of Asian refugees as well as the site of a daring attempt to resolve a hijacking crisis by Israeli forces in 1976. Although still functioning, principally for private aircraft, it is dilapidated. Commercial flights use a more modern airport, as though Entebbe airport is too scarred by history to be reused. The contrast between the private aircraft and the destitute building is striking. The work evokes a bygone era as well as the consequences of enforced action. The play of light and shadow is emphatic, the dark interior, with its lattice window frames, evoking prison conditions in contrast to the verdant open landscape. The title of the work refers to Bhimji’s father and his decision to leave Uganda, thus closing a chapter of the family history. By returning to Uganda, Bhimji has reopened it.","Zarina Bhimji’s films and photographs result from prolonged research in the field. Over the past few years she has traveled to Zanzibar, India and East Africa (including Uganda where she was born), retracing the path of the former British colonists. However the artworks produced from her enquiries are not in the documentary genre: she is interested in evoking human presence in places where it is absent, but where an atmospheric tension resulting from previous tragic events is still felt.Notwithstanding the manifestation of an acute political awareness in her work, Zarina Bhimji does not neglect the visual aspect: architecture is put to good use in her meticulous compositions, walls being a recurring motif of her visual vocabulary. Her landscapes are sometimes close to abstraction, yet one can feel in them the power of past violence. The beauty and poetry emerging from the images evince a feeling of wonder mixed with a profound melancholy, in the romantic tradition.Zarina Bhimji was born in Mbarara, Uganda in 1963.

Charlotte Moth,"Charlotte Moth asked the art critic Francesco Pedraglio to write a text in response to the Man Ray film “Les Mystères du Château de Dé”, the decor of which was the Villa Noailles, built by Mallet-Stevens. Pedraglio’s text was then displaced since the artist attributed it to her own photographs taken on the rue Mallet-Stevens in Paris. A percussionist gave a audio response to the film during the opening at the Halle fu?r Kunst in  Lüneburg, in 2010. His reaction was then edited into the film. Thus the artist articulated several subjectivities to which we add our own. Light is a major protagonist in her work. Photography is envisaged from an uncertain point of view in terms of its usage, like live matter, formless, malleable and modular. With no title or date, the images express chance and thrilling juxtapositions. Although the darkroom remains the photographer’s tool, Charlotte Moth deals with the image as a sculptor. Through the image, architecture, citation and decor become dematerialized or materialized sculpture.","Charlotte Moth has been constituting an image bank since 1999. She photographs and develops black and white photographs taken in places she passes through around the world. With the eye of a sculptor, she records Modernist architecture in Brazil, Bauhaus style in Germany, empty spaces, out of time. Thus she creates a classification of different types of spaces (different species). This Travelogue, as she calls it, is an organic process, a collage, an activity revealing connections between image and experience. Entirely black and white and with great economy (identical formats, modest sizes), the images convey an obsession with line, order, construction and emptiness. Charlotte Moth doesn’t only have a nostalgic gaze on these spaces since she also proposes multiple readings. Acting as assembler, collector and archivist, she introduces a distanced point of view on her own work. With a Post-Conceptual approach, the artist proposes an in-depth and ambitious conception of the nature of the image and its authority.Charlotte Moth was born in Carshalton (UK) in 1978, and has been living in Paris since 2007.",The Absent Forms,Europe,"['movie.n.01', 'opportunity.n.01', 'footing.n.01', 'imagine.v.01', 'supporter.n.01', 'matter.n.01', 'write.v.01', 'image.n.01', 'tool.n.01', 'architecture.n.01', 'paris.n.01', 'photography.n.01', 'photographer.n.01', 'construct.v.01', 'light.n.01', 'position.n.03', 'title.n.01', 'sculpture.n.01', 'photograph.n.01']","['subjectivity.n.01', 'light.n.07', 'collection.n.01', 'uncertainty.n.01', 'authorship.n.02', 'travelogue.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/img-746-1.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/img-746-1-300x191.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/the-absent-forms/,"['Material_Physical/4.8619047619047615', 'Individual_Personal/3.488888888888889', 'Cultural/2.488888888888889']","['Material_Physical', 'Individual_Personal', 'Cultural']",10.83968253968254,"['Materiality/1.6333333333333333', 'Arts/1.6', 'Mind/1.0']","['Materiality', 'Arts', 'Mind']",4.233333333333333,"['Cultural/28.711163939259926', 'Individual_Personal/7.283272283272282', 'Material_Physical/5.03052503052503']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Material_Physical']",41.02496125305724,"['Arts/13.921014546169348', 'Media/5.984188034188034', 'Mind/4.1098901098901095']","['Arts', 'Media', 'Mind']",24.015092690247492,1.0,0.6666666666666666
Douglas Gordon,"Blind Spencer is part of the series “Blind Stars” including hundreds of works in which the artist cut out the eyes of Hollywood stars, in a symbolically violent manner. An emptiness (some are burned letting appear a white or mirror background or a mirror) replaces the eyes, giving the impression of a blind eye deprived of all expression. Paradoxically, the work looks at us all the more intensely. The glamorous black and white portrait of Spencer Tracy evokes the golden age of Hollywood, with all of its codes like seductive smiles and directional light, not to mention a perverse use of the gaze.  Gordon talks about his work as a process of “research, memory, of stories that took place, the films I’ve seen … I am interested in looking for what happens when you look at something so long that it disappears. You are viewing an image, you start looking through the image, and you reach the other side and then you return to the surface. ” This act of cutting, pertinent to a new generation of artists focusing on the ready-made, image fragments and found sound footage, juxtaposes temporalities like in video editing and introduces a hint of melancholy. The act of cutting fascinates and repels, in what Freud called an experience of “the uncanny.” The viewer can only contemplate a loss of the soul which is traditionally reflected in the eyes. After Andy Warhol and his celebrity portraits, Douglas Gordon tracks the iconic and deadly character of his subjects.","Douglas Gordon is a celebrated Scottish artist whose work revolves around the themes of memory, time and our perception of it. Spanning across film, video, installation, photography, and sculpture, his work offers a new experience of the cinematic in the space of contemporary art, creating what critic Dominique Païni described as ‘exhibition cinema.’      Interested in how we experience temporality, Gordon has often slowed down either original or appropriated footage in order to play with the viewers’ perception. An example is his celebrated work 24 Hour Psycho (1993), in which Gordon stretched the duration of Alfred Hitchcock’s iconic movie to last 24 hours. This gesture both monumentalized time and intensified the imagery, structurally reframing the film by shifting our perception away from the movie’s original narrative and directing it towards the finer details that constitute every single frame.     Several of his works incorporate that universal dichotomies: of life and death, innocence and guilt, and dual identities. Harboring the tension between opposing forces, Gordon then employs formal strategies of repetition, mirroring, and doubling to construct a deliberate ambiguity and multiplicity of meaning.",Blind Spencer (Mirror),Europe,"['eyes.n.01', 'hollywood.n.01', 'mirror.n.01', 'star.n.01', 'portrayal.n.01', 'white.a.01', 'black.a.01 white.a.01', 'fragment.n.01', 'reflect.v.01', 'footage.n.01', 'gaze.n.01', 'eye.n.01', 'coevals.n.01', 'age.n.01', 'iconic.a.01', 'expression.n.01', 'image.n.01', 'background.n.01', 'surface.n.01', 'artist.n.01', 'impression.n.01', 'black.a.01', 'memory.n.01', 'manner.n.01', 'light.n.01']","['hollywood.n.02', 'gaze.n.01', 'blindness.n.01', 'mass_culture.n.01', 'cutout.n.03', 'disquieting.s.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/img-169.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/img-169-279x300.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/blind-spencer-mirror/,"['Cultural/1.9473684210526314', 'Individual_Personal/1.9090909090909092', 'Material_Physical/0.9090909090909091']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Material_Physical']",4.765550239234449,"['Body/1.9090909090909092', 'Media/1.0', 'Culture/0.9473684210526315']","['Body', 'Media', 'Culture']",3.8564593301435406,"['Cultural/23.970135746606346', 'Individual_Personal/20.520879120879126', 'Material_Physical/16.903962703962705']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Material_Physical']",61.39497757144818,"['Mind/8.38021978021978', 'Space/7.823443223443223', 'Culture/7.756410256410256']","['Mind', 'Space', 'Culture']",23.96007326007326,1.0,0.3333333333333333
Tacita Dean,"The photographic quality of the film Baobab is not only the result of a highly sophisticated use of black and white and light, but also of the way in which each tree is characterized as an individual, creating in the end a series of portraits. The monumental and unnatural aspect of the baobabs turns them into strange and anthropomorphic personalities. Adding to the descriptive aspect of the film, the sound is a recording of the environment, of sounds made by animals, and participates in this peaceful contemplation. The still, almost fossilized aspect of the landscape makes it look majestic and eternal.  « The camera, which examines in Baobab the ancestral and imposing trees of Madagascar, tries to capture the shadow and light effects, specific to photography. »  (Essay by Julia Garimorth, in « Tacita Dean: Seven Books », published by Steidl / ARC/ Musée d’Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris, 2003).","Although Tacita Dean works with all kinds of media, her 16mm films are probably among her most well-known works. While they deal with the specificities of the medium – like the notions of time and narrative, through the use of still shots – the aesthetic quality of her films remind of photography or painting (maybe because she had studied painting in school). Memories and atmospheres are conveyed through sensual images, colors and light. In her work, Tacita Dean relates the past to the present, often creating a certain melancholy: the artist focuses on stories, characters or architectural relics, and questions the notion of narrative by using both documentary and fiction devices.Tacita Dean was born in Canterbury, UK, in 1965.

Joachim Koester,"Tarantism is the name of disease which appeared in southern Italy, resulting from the bite of a spider called Tarantula. This bite caused various symptoms, such as nausea, difficulty to speak, delusion, excitability and agitation. The victims suffered then from convulsions and the only way to heal them was to engage in a frenzied dance, as it was believed.  Called “Tarantella”, this dance, appeared during the Middle Ages and was danced all along the 19th century.  To make this video, the artist asked a group of dancers to perform this uncontrolled dance in order to explore this borderline mental and physical state, close to a trance. Tarantism represents a transition in the artist’s work, who brings a story back to life simply through the movement of these completely disarticulate bodies, without referring to images extracted from reality, thus exploring a purely mental territory.","With a keen interest in the stranger corners of the long human story, and a persistent interest in the supernatural, the transcendent, and the psychedelic, Joachim Koester’s work follows the artists own undying interest in physical and psychological limits. While exploration was  a matter of crossing geographies before the 19th century, the 20th century brought the mental exploration of our unconscious, hastened by the discovery of psychoanalysis. Koester is interested in visualizing specific events—those forgotten, overlooked, or suppressed by the official historical record—in order to reintroduce them into collective memory. Using 16mm documentary films, photographic series or books, his work transforms stories into images and vice versa, appearing as a quest for the invisible and the vanishing.",Tarantism,Europe,"['dance.n.01', 'name.v.01', 'perform.v.01', 'district.n.01', 'boundary_line.n.01', 'age.n.01', 'century.n.01', 'passage.n.01', 'center.n.01', 'research.v.02', 'physical.a.01', 'motion.n.03', 'body.n.01', 'world.n.03', 'narrative.n.01', 'life.n.01', 'video.n.01', 'image.n.01']","['unconscious_mind.n.01', 'release.n.09', 'tarantella.n.02', 'dance.n.01', 'psychological_state.n.01', 'bodied.s.02']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/img-277.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/img-277-300x200.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/tarantism/,"['Cultural/14.915118868060047', 'Individual_Personal/11.80719280719281', 'Society/9.815209428252908']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Society']",36.53752110350576,"['Arts/7.661064425770307', 'Mind/5.013419913419913', 'Power/4.126373626373627']","['Arts', 'Mind', 'Power']",16.800857965563846,"['Material_Physical/32.76224639653432', 'Society/19.84963955892749', 'Individual_Personal/17.505946994182292']","['Material_Physical', 'Society', 'Individual_Personal']",70.11783294964411,"['Land/10.628413416648712', 'Urbanization/10.14871794871795', 'Body/7.973712561947855']","['Land', 'Urbanization', 'Body']",28.75084392731452,0.6666666666666666,0.0
Matthew Darbyshire,"In Kan’s four-channel video Island, a series of objects like nail clippers, hairbrush, toothpaste, and house decorations are shot in close-up. These highly polished and aestheticized images, create a poetic visual flow. However, in front of each object lies a coin of different value—two yuan, one pound, one euro, one dollar—that silently reveals the material value of the household supplies. Underneath the video’s elegant surface there is a deep sense of critical irony, elaborated in the contradictory nature of the cheap plastic items and their sophistic visual interpretation. Kan poignantly and metaphorically comments on the economic and production at the base of today’s global market and shows that extremely influential visual spectacles can be generated by the most everyday of items.","Matthew Darbyshire is interested in the non-specificity of today’s design language. Parodying corporate branding and mass-produced design, Darbyshire’s installations expose the hollow realities behind urban regeneration and government arts investment in social regenerative projects. At the centre of Darbyshire’s work is the observation that certain core human concerns – among them the look and feel of the built environment, the intersection of art and the social realm, the idea of community and eve the possibility  of visual pleasure – are, very often, framed in ways that are reductive, philosophically empty and serve only to further the interests of embedded power. Unusually for an artist who belongs to a generation that regularly revisits episodes form the (usually Modernist) past, Darbyshire’s focus is on what he calls the ‘mush and fug’ of contemporary Britain’s visual environment, something that in a high-wire act of chromatic and formal management he sequences into works that, while they speak eloquently of the quasyhomogeneity of much present day architecture and design, also have a resonant sculptural presence.*Matthew Darbyshire was born in Cambridge, UK, in 1977.

Tino Sehgal,"Tino Sehgal’s This Exhibition requires an interpreter (in this particular piece, a gallery attendant) to faux faint each and every time a visitor enters into a given space. Upon hitting the cold, hard  gallery floor, the seemingly confused interpreter writhes slowly on the ground while reciting a few lines from the curatorial statement in a whispered moan.","Tino Sehgal  has developed a radical artistic practice that takes the form of live encounters between people. He describes his works as ‘constructed situations’, whose materials are the human voice, language, movement, and interaction, without the production of physical objects. What all of Sehgal’s works have in common is that they remain only in the space and time they occupy, and in the memory of the work and its reception. Despite its immaterial character, the artist’s work fulfills the conventions of visual art and functions fully within the infrastructure of the art gallery or museum. The work is present during the entire duration of an exhibition, it enters public and private collections and exists over time by being repeated.  As he stated in an interview with Tim Griffin for Artforum: “The reason I’m interested in the transformation of actions. . . is because I think that the appearance of both an excess supply of basic material goods and of mankind’s endangering of the specific disposition of “nature” in which human life seems possible renders the hegemony of the dominant mode of production questionable. Obviously, this doesn’t mean to propose an essentialist “No” to material objects in general but rather leads to the question as to how we could produce things that, on the one hand, aren’t problematic and, on the other, are more interesting or complex, or less static.”Artforum, May 2005, p. 218-219  Tino Sehgal was born in London in 1976.

Guy Ben-Ner,"Wild Boy  is the story of the education of Amir, the artist’s son. Ben-Ner plays the educator’s part, trying to domesticate the child. Using the metaphor of the wild child is Ben-Ner’s homage to this recurring theme in literature and cinema: from Edgar Rice Burroughs’ « Tarzan » to Truffaut’s « L’enfant sauvage », and Rudyard Kipling’s « Jungle book ». The video is an attempt at capturing this decisive moment when the child lets go of its wilderness to become « civilized », and raises the nature/culture dichotomy, dear to the Enlightenment philosophers.","In his films, Guy Ben-Ner plays with the history of cinema, referring to the experimental origins of silent film, to comic figures such as Keaton and Chaplin, and to Truffaut’s French New Wave. Since 1996, the artist has been concentrating on his family members and stages them with burlesque humor. Just as Buster Keaton, he is at once actor-director, his wife and children the only other actors, and his apartment the improvised set: he uses available furniture and objects, creates an artificial island in his kitchen and constructs a tree house for Treehouse Kit (2005), a work in which the sculpture takes part in the video installation. The theatrical aspect of the set relates to the playful situations. Each one of Ben-Ner’s films participates, as an episode, to a collection of fables about human nature, reenacting stereotypical motifs found in literature and cinema, such as the desert island (“Berkeleys Island” 1999) or “Moby Dick” (2000).

Vivek Vilasini,"In his work Housing Dreams Walls, the houses photographed are from a closely-knit locale in Kerala – a significant and rapidly popular pattern in this part of the country. The pattern of richly colored and aggressively decorated residences symbolizes prosperity and exudes a sense of security – both financial and social. Although the vocabulary of aesthetics can be termed kitsch, the idea is to understand the underlying expression in the ostentatiously and vibrantly decorated households and giving them some sense of individuality, reflecting their owners’ personalities. The colorful walls symbolize wealth, while also reflecting the manner in which the owners would like others to perceive them. On a less visible level, the paint used also happens to be toxic, so it pollutes the ground when rain showers wash the colorful houses.","Born 1964 in Trishur, Kerala, India Lives and works in Bangalore, India  First trained as a Marine radio officer at the All India Marine College in Kochi, Vivek Vilasini obtained a Bachelor’s degree in Political Science from Kerala University in 1987 before turning to art and studying traditional Indian craftspeople’s sculpture. In his work Vilasini examines our existing social structures, adapting various expressions of cultural identity prevalent in society today to raise questions about the continually changing global scenario that every individual struggles to keep pace with. In the photo collage Between One Shore and Several Others (Just what is it… after Richard Hamilton) from 2008, Vilasini referred to Richard Hamilton’s iconic pop collage Just What Is It That Makes Today’s Homes So Different, So Appealing? (1965) by crossing the cultures of the East and the West.

Meschac Gaba,"The headdresses, woven from artificial hair braids, symbolize historical icons including Martin Luther King, Kwame Nkrumah, Fela Kuti and King Guézo of Dahomey. The wigs portraying these grand figures also unambiguously recall Africa to mind. By declaring Cotonou, one of Benin’s cities, the Art Museum of Real Life, and by having thirty white-clad figures wearing Gaba’s latest series of tresses cross through it, he draws attention to the urban space and its inhabitants’ strategies of survival and improvisation. In doing this, he enquires into alternative models, and into the tasks and local interpretations of the museum: “The micro-macro economy represents the survival of the inhabitants of this city day after day (…) In the city of Cotonou, you can see installations everywhere – it is like an open-air museum.” In this series Meschac Gaba weaves symbolic crowns that suggest a historical character, suggested through one of her or his realizations. Here in the case of former Beninese president Hubert Maga, the hairstyle headdress is woven in the form of a hospital that was built during his reign and was named after him. The forms and styles of braided hairstyles range from purely functional to complex and symbolic: hair can be an indicator of age, authority, social status, religion or even supernatural powers. In cities across Europe and the Americas, African hair braiders produce extravagant creations based on their traditional braiding skills and styles, uniting capitalist commerce with traditional culture. In Gaba´s work, two seemingly divergent products of humankind, hair and architecture, meet as equally significant symbols of modern culture. In making this work, Gaba assumes the role of the nouveau tresseur or tresseuse (the new braider), a traditional Beninese hair braider, reassigning meaning to architectural forms and cultural experiences.","born in 1961 in Cotonou, Benin.He lives and works between Cotonou and Rotterdam  Over the past 20 years, through various bodies of works, Beninese artist Meshac Gaba has attempted to reframe contemporary African artistic identity, asking us to shed our preconceived ideas and re-imagine the African continent with a more valid contemporary image. Meschac Gaba emerged onto the international contemporary art scene in 1999 when he presented the Museum of Contemporary African Art in the exhibition “Mirror’s Edge” at Bilmuseet in Umea, Sweden. It marked the beginning of an expansive conceptual and virtual project based on the subjectivity of museum spaces. Twelve installations constitute his imagined Museum of Contemporary African Art (MCAA), originally created in 1997 and shown individually at other international institutions or events since then. Confronted with one’s cultural centrality, the spectator is asked to reconsider his viewpoint of memory and history. Gaba’s complex and varied artistic practice provides an in-depth examination of cultural appropriation, public space, the role of the western museum, and the changing global economy. His appropriation of tourist imagery –from cinema and souvenirs to magazines and museums– allows the viewer to deconstruct the western iconography and disturb modes of representation in contemporary art.",Hubert Maga (perruque MAVA-musée d'art de la vie active),Middle East & Africa,"['hair.n.01', 'traditional.a.01', 'day.n.01', 'museum.n.01', 'city.n.01', 'symbolic.a.01', 'historical.a.01', 'form.n.01', 'manner.n.01', 'culture.n.01', 'figure.n.01', 'world.n.08', 'martin.n.01', 'europe.n.01', 'creation.n.01', 'africa.n.01', 'symbol.n.01', 'status.n.01', 'scheme.n.01', 'age.n.01', 'local.a.01', 'icon.n.01', 'architectural.a.01', 'series.n.01', 'complex.a.01']","['architecture.n.02', 'improvisation.n.01', 'hair.n.01', 'cross-cultural.a.01', 'braid.n.01', 'west.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/gaba_copie.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/gaba_copie-225x300.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/untitled-29/,"['Cultural/18.976928936216872', 'Material_Physical/7.132478632478633', 'Society/4.745035666088297']","['Cultural', 'Material_Physical', 'Society']",30.8544432347838,"['Arts/9.257367778420411', 'Technology/4.083333333333333', 'Land/4.038461538461539']","['Arts', 'Technology', 'Land']",17.379162650215285,"['Cultural/15.153840767076066', 'Society/12.72190603514133', 'Individual_Personal/10.772405372405373']","['Cultural', 'Society', 'Individual_Personal']",38.648152174622766,"['Arts/6.0025641025641026', 'Spirituality/4.146031746031746', 'Urbanization/3.623529411764706']","['Arts', 'Spirituality', 'Urbanization']",13.772125260360555,0.6666666666666666,0.3333333333333333
Haris Epaminonda,"Created from extracts of kitsch movies or Greek soap operas from the 1960s, these videos are like audiovisual ‘postcards’ reflecting a nostalgic and melancholic approach. The images have lost their context and original meaning to then be re-assembled, confronted to each other and superimposed with other elements, to reveal new sequences. The narration has disappeared from the sequences and the spectator waits in vain for something to happen.  In “Tarahi V”, the saturated colors of the sequences collected from 1960 films seem to give a new life to the characters (the little girl in pink with her doll, the couple walking backwards, etc.) while the fireworks, superimposed throughout the film provide a disenchanting aspect to the whole scene. Recalling Hitchcock as well as René Magritte, “Tarahi V” presents a pending moment providing the shots and the characters with ghostly appearances. This feeling is reinforced by the piano arrangement creating tension throughout the whole sequence.  The lighting, the colors and the particular rhythm of Haris Epaminonda’s films provide a strong radiant power. They are like traces of a fictionalized past permanently stuck in one’s memory. Haris Epaminonda’s films and collages belong to a fragmented art that questions the “in between”, a shifting moment leading to a new spatial and time-related sphere.","Epaminonda’s video works are based on re-shot excerpts of film and television footage – principally the Greek soap operas and kitsch romantic films fromthe 1960s that used to fill up Sunday afternoons in the artist’s Cypriot childhood –which she then subtly reworks.

Haris Epaminonda,"Haris Epaminonda’s work questions the manipulation and the flow of images as well as their power of fascination. The images she works with to create her collages (paper or video) come from magazines or history books, film extracts or soap operas from the 1960s and 1970s.

Meiro Koizumi,"This video installation was made for the exhibition “Journey to the West” held in January 2012 in New Delhi, where a group of curators invited six Japanese artists to produce a work to be made around the relationship between Japan and India. In the framework of this exhibition, Meiro Koizumi decided to use a controversial book of modern Japanese history The Judgement of Justice Radhabinod Pal, as material for his work. Koizumi created a performance combining the paradoxical context of this book with monstrous representation of Indian gods. The central performer had to read the Judgement of Pal as seriously as possible, while two other performers on the side had to make a comedy out of the situation. It is Koizumi’s attempt to create a new god-like mythical figure that embodies the contradiction inscribed within modern Japanese history and identity. The context of this work has much to do with the trial held in Tokyo right after the war to judge Japanese war criminals. Judge Pal was the only Asian judge to be invited to the trial, and he was the only one that found all the defendants not guilty.","Meiro Koizumi is a Japanese video and performing artist, born in 1976. He has built a compelling body of work that deals with power dynamics on scales from the familial to the national, and examines questions of political and psychological control.

Willie Doherty,"“I focused on how the political and physical merged” analyzes Willie Doherty. Out of the Shadows II plunges us into a dark night lit by a few street lights in a deserted street where a car is parked in the Irish city of Derry. What is at stake is yet to be unearthed. The context of this picture is not revealed immediately. The pre-text or the information and interpretations made ??by the spectator puts the image in the “troubled” political context of Northern Ireland (a car bomb?) led by the sectarian resentment between communities (the wall evokes a zone of non-visibility). In contrast to the iconography of terrorism in the media, Doherty does not capture the moment of violence itself, but rather an “anti-headline,” the location of a possible confrontation, past or future. Thus, “Out of the Shadows II” substitutes the narrative of the event with a political image, embracing the event’s description with the aesthetics of the urban landscape.","Much of the work of Willie Doherty – as pointed out in his 2007 retrospective at the Kunstverein Hamburg and Munich Lenbachhaus – is built around Derry City in Northern Ireland, the birthplace of the Irish artist. His photographs, stories, videos, and installations are driven by the internecine war and political-religious agitation in Northern Ireland between the nationalist community predominantly Catholic and the unionist Protestant majority that has occurred since the late 60’s. The city and public space are the scene of civil conflicts. In the video “Three Potential Endings” (2008) political space is allegorized in the architecture. The work of Doherty transforms these “non-places” into sets. In “Grey Day IX” (2007), the idea of ??borders, understood as a separation is less cernable and more diffuse. Daily and anonymous violence in an intolerant public space is denounced. His images raise the question of the representation of political confrontation, through the use of codes in art and cinema, and by means of image and text. Tension, oppression, uncertainty, and fear are like a sub-representation without specific references in the picture.Willie Doherty was born in 1959 in Derry, Ireland where he lives and works today.",Out of the Shadows II,Europe,"['political.a.01', 'shadow.n.01', 'event.n.01', 'street.n.01', 'context.n.01', 'urban.a.01 landscape.n.01', 'future.n.01', 'capture.v.01', 'violence.n.01', 'night.n.01', 'location.n.01', 'uncover.v.01', 'contrast.n.01', 'community.n.01', 'interpretation.n.01', 'physical.a.01', 'moment.n.01', 'urban.a.01', 'picture.n.01', 'medium.n.01', 'image.n.01', 'light.n.01', 'wall.n.01', 'narrative.n.01', 'city.n.01']","['civil_war.n.01', 'possibility.n.01', 'car_bomb.n.01', 'ireland.n.02', 'irish_republican_army.n.01', 'urban.a.02']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/img-70.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/img-70-300x197.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/out-of-the-shadows-ii/,"['Society/5.18954248366013', 'Individual_Personal/4.0', 'Cultural/1.5555555555555556']","['Society', 'Individual_Personal', 'Cultural']",10.745098039215685,"['War/2.5882352941176467', 'Violence/1.6013071895424837', 'Mind/1.6']","['War', 'Violence', 'Mind']",5.78954248366013,"['Cultural/28.511708879355947', 'Material_Physical/25.013114989585585', 'Society/17.428808446455506']","['Cultural', 'Material_Physical', 'Society']",70.95363231539704,"['Urbanization/8.915837104072398', 'Media/8.772134238310707', 'Time/8.46984126984127']","['Urbanization', 'Media', 'Time']",26.157812612224376,0.6666666666666666,0.0
Michael Landy,"H.2.N.Y Skeleton of the Dump revolves entirely around the performance “Homage to New York” (1960),  of the Swiss artist Jean Tinguely (1925-1991),  during which the machine built by the artist in the gardens of the Museum of Modern Art (MOMA) had to self-destruct itself in 27 minutes, but, in the end, it had to be finished off by firemenbeing called in after it erupted in flames. Since the discovery of Jean tinguely’s retrospective at the Tate Gallery in London, in 1982, Michael Landy spent two years researching and sketching (charcoal, oil, glue, ink) from his previous research carried out  at Museum Tinguely in Basel, and at the MOMA in New York. By labor intensive work,  Michael Landy tried to recapture the essence of the event, to dislocate and to revive it with these the black and white drawings. He made them on several scales, some very small, some medium format and some, like this, large scale. Made with oil stick or white glue or both, he played on the idea of mezzotint as well as the idea of night time performance. The images are based on the film made of Tinguely’s action. Some drawings are made as though within the machine, and others, like this one, are made as though observing the machine from a distance. In certain drawings the machine is self-destructing, in others it is complete. Skeleton of the Dump shows the machine in lonely isolation, almost an outsider and rather forlorn. The motif itself is simply the white paper showing through.","One of the leading artists of his generation, Michael Landy’s work has posed serious questions about globalisation, recycling, regeneration and politics. Not afraid to embrace the traditional skills of drawing, he has also made large scale installations using multimedia. He is most famous for his installation, Break Down (2001) in which he systematically catalogued then destroyed all of his possessions in a disused department store. With sharp and wry observations on every-day life, Landy constantly seeks to question the relationship between art, institutions and markets.  Michael Landy was born in London, UK, in 1963.

Francis Alÿs,"The Nightwatch, which is an ironic reference to the celebrated painting by Rembrandt, follows the course of a fox wandering among the celebrated collections of the National Portrait Gallery in London. The path of the fox, from galleries containing 16th, 17th and 18th century portraits of historic figures from British history hung on plush walls, is circuitous and seemingly random.The fox tracks back and forth, sometimes inspecting the gallery furniture, often walking through the middle of the room but sometimes around its perimeter until eventually it climbs on top of a showcase, covered in fabric where he settles down to sleep. The actions of the fox are observed from the close-circuit television cameras which form part of the museum’s security system. Foxes are now commonly found in London roaming the suburban streets at night-time. They are in a sense flaneurs sauvages. The insertion of a fox in such an august institution is at once bizarre and yet in some sense perfectly normal. There is a constant tension in the film: will the fox do some damage, what attracts him to particualr places that he returns to; how does he decide where he will settle. The fox acculturises to the gallery in the same way he has become acclimatised to the city. The fox is an outsider, an interloper banned from the city that has re-inserted itself. Alys draws a parallel between the fox and himself. ‘No matter how long I have been away, I have one foot in a European culture, and one foot out… A lot of my work has played on the double status’. The theme of surveillance is multi-layered. On the one hand the fox is staking out the gallery; the portraits on the wall appear to be watching him; the security cameras are monitoring both the paintings and the fox and finally, we the viewer are observing the whole action.","Trained as an architect, Alÿs turned to a visual arts based practice in the early 1990s as a more immediate, direct, and effective way of exploring issues related to urbanization, to the ordering and signification of urban space and to the semiotics of its use. His work initiates with a simple action, either by him or others, which is then documented in a range of media. Alÿs explores subjects such as modernizing programs in Latin America and border zones in areas of conflict, often asking about the relevance of poetic acts in politicized situations. Documentation is central to his practice as well as painting, drawing, and video. In his work, When Faith Moves Mountains (2002) made in collaboration with Mexican critic Cuauhtemoc Medina, Alÿs recruited 500 volunteers outside of Lima, Peru. Each person moved a shovel full of sand one step at a time form one side of a dune to the other, and together they moved the entire geographical location of the dune by a few inches. Critic Jean Fisher linked Alÿs’ work to the radical event of precipitating a crisis of meaning, where the exposure of a void of meaning is confronted by its social situation, leading up to some kind of truth.

Evariste Richer,"Cumulocumulonimbus capillatus incus functions on the mode of a mise en abîme: it is a cube composed with 8000 dice. The work plays with chance, each installation produces a renewed visual combination. Robert Filliou said that Eins. Un. One… (16000 dice spread on the floor, 1984) “can materialise, materialises and will materialise with no limit to the most diverse forms or combination of forms.”  Richers’ sculpture acts like an encoded and pixellated image of an individual according to different layers of meaning: the weight of the work is equivalent to that of an average man (76kg); the colours of the dice recall those used in diagrams representing a codified human DNA; every choice that mankind has to make could be imagined as a roll of dice. The title of this sculpture refers to a cloud that provokes very destructive hail and thunderstorms. The sculpture is as fragile and threatening as this meteorological phenomenon – dislocation and explosion loom. In his work, the artist creates assocations between dice, hailstones, meteorites. Different levels of meaning (mankind, the cliCmate, games) are crystallised in this artwork according to concatenation logic that creates a whole. The artist links the individual and the atmosphere, microcosm and macrocosm, in a manner close in spirit to the sociologist Edgar Morin’s concept of complexity (etymologically meaning “what is woven together”), as a web of interlacing.","Evariste Richer constantly invents new standards for measurement which are mostly objects to prompt the spectator’s potential investigations: avalanche probes, a meter drawn from memory, a meter with no measurements… Meteorology, science, magic, mineralogy, photography, optics are his preferred terrains. The artist reveals meaning through displacements, changes of state such as the physical occurrence of sublimation (matter transforming from solid to gas). In Ecran (Screen, 2008), the weave of a projection screen is blown-up full-scale and takes over the entire room. Evariste Richer makes visible these micro perforations which are usually hidden by the film being projected; he reveals the infra small and ghostly. Blow up (2003), a tennis ball which has been turned in on itself, could stand as an allegory for sedimentation and concatenation. The concentration of meaning and gesture produces the artwork. The constant shifting between the cosmic and the infra small brings together knowledge and observation, certainties and the poetry of art. A piece from a meteorite can become a dice (Médéorite,  2008), a dice turning at high speed can become an illustration of the energy principle (Le grêlon noir/The Black Hailstone, 2008). Crystallisation – which was defined by Stendhal as feelings born in the imagination that become attached to an object to transfigure it – is the base of Richer’s work.

Eric Dizambourg,"Like the film Le Mouton noir, this dimension is counterbalanced by a burlesque element. The piece of fabric on the rat’s paw or ‘graft’ becomes a patchwork made out of colorful geometric shapes recalling a Harlequin costume, thus referring directly to the burlesque tradition. This leitmotiv creates a contrast with the dull colors, the humility of the countryside, and makes the figurative scene look unreal to reveal its superficiality.  The stiff character seems to be in a procession, while the introduction of the burlesque element transforms it into a carnival. The achievement of the picture occurs in two parts: first the painting of a figurative scene by the artist, and then the moment where the scene becomes absurd.","Eric Dizambourg was born in Créteil, France, in 1984.

Jason Dodge,"In Algeria, Djidjiga Meffre has woven a fabric with a string, a length equal to the distance from the earth to troposphere. Several works by Dodge, with the same title, follow this principle of measurement.  The work, like a synecdoche, is synthesized by its material and its implementation, both of which are fully part of the meaning. The work functions like as a concentrate. Shades of color and texture relate to multiple sensory and visual sensations, evoking a sky-colored night. It is by its concentration in the weaving that the distance can be represented in a concrete way and visible in one glance. To describe the work amounts to producing a story that echoes the myths surrounding the process of weaving. Above the weather opens up multiple narratives; in the etymological sense, the text is a fabric. We can see the work as a magic carpet that allows a moving “imaginary” of the spirit in the atmosphere. The weaving technique used in the work is frequently used by the artist, contributing to Dodge’s overall poetic aesthetics.","Jason Dodge extracts objects from everyday life – of which he adds minimal alterations by  the way that he isolates and presents them. For instance, he collects all the light sources of a house in “Darkness falls on Wolkowyja Poland” (2005), he samples the strings of a violin in “The viola duo of Bela Bartok” (2007), he records on a light sensitive photo paper in “Into Black” (2007), and finally he adds a bell brush chimney sweep in “Ringing Through chimneys” (2007). The artist goes beyond the silent dimension of the object to reveal their narrative potential, triggering fiction. The artist considers them as elements of a broader context. “I ??try to consider my work related to writing, but using a visual language,” says the Dodge. Name placards accompanying works are pretexts for further stories, supplemented by the imagination of the viewer and their inquiries. The artist, as a storyteller, reintroduces stories, the spoken word, and language in the space of the white cube. In Dodge’s work, the readable is not reducible to the visible. It operates like a trompe l’oeil, an image that gives the illusion of distance from reality, yet is blurred by the poetry of the intervention of the artist.  Jason Dodge was born in 1969 in Newton, Pennsylvania, USA.

Simon Starling,"Invited in 2007 to the Museum Folkwang in Essen (Germany), Simon Starling questioned its history: known for its collections and particularly for its early engagement in favor of modern art (including the acquisition and exhibition of works by Cézanne, Gauguin, Van Gogh, Matisse), then destroyed during the Second World War, the museum was pillaged for its masterpieces of ‘degenerate art’ by the nazis. Starling found photographs of a hang dating back to 1929, taken by Albert Renger-Patzsch, the German New Objectivity photographer. Firstly, he researched the artworks that were presented then which for the most part had been restituted or acquired by private collectors after the war. Secondly, he reconstituted this hang. Finally, he took the same pictures as Renger-Patzsch, with the same ‘scientific objectivity’. The result is simple and minimal, and tends to erase any difference with the original. Playing on the notion of author, Starling identically reconstructs (‘Nachbau’ means reconstruction in German), thus he realizes an exact replica of the photographs taken seventy years earlier. By blurring temporalities, the artist manipulates the history of the collections and questions the outcome of the images and the institution in light of this actual reconstruction in the museum. This work can also be understood as an absurd attempt to go back in time in order to correct history.","Simon Starling provokes unexpected crossings between objects, materials and events. He produces hybrid works that seem to come from another space-time continuum. In 1995, he used the aluminium from a chair designed by Jorge Pensi to reproduce nine copies of a beer can found on the Bauhaus site in Dessau, thus creating a condensed history of design in a rather trivial object, turning a piece of rubbish found by chance into the clue of a historical lineage neither absurd nor authentic.While avoiding formal creation ex nihilo, the artist paradoxically behaves like a true demiurge. His works imply processes of metamorphosis quite similar to alchemy. He appropriates forms and objects and integrates them into complex networks of meaning which do not aim at revealing a hidden history but rather at drawing unseen paths that ultimately exist only because of his intervention.Simon Starling was born in 1967 in Epsom, UK.

Natasha Wheat,"Wheat’s work is built on a strong conceptual framework that weaves together commentary on social and political issues and the radical potential for change. Be Oblivion, in Disconnect (2011) is a sculpture and an intervention. Two cardboard boxes house white neon letters that collectively have the potential to spell “Be Oblivion.” The dismembered phrase is rendered powerless in its present state; the potential power lies with the viewer, who could conceivably reconstruct it. The boxes sit on wooden pallets of the kind typically used for shipping; by painting them white and repurposing them as pedestals, Wheat removes them from circulation as carriers of commodities. The simple cardboard boxes are also discarded shipping materials.  The words “Be Oblivion” are a seeming command to fade away into obscurity. This simple phrase resonates as a harbinger of defeat. Perhaps the provocative installation is a pointed statement about our collective loss of power: in politics, commerce, war, international relations, social issues, or all of these. Wheat asks us to resurrect her jumbled phrase in our minds, contemplate it, and see if it is time for an insurrection.","Natasha Wheat’s diverse body of work explores social experience as a sensual phenomenon that is riddled with hierarchical complexity. Her objects, installations, and interventions engender and disrupt a full range of interpersonal relations. Wheat was the founder of Project Grow, an art studio and urban farming program based in Portland, Oregon, that employed developmentally disabled adults and investigated the intersection of food, ideology, society, and exchange. She earned her BFA from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago and an MFA with an emphasis in social practice from California College of the Arts.","Be Oblivion, in Disconnect",Americas,"['phrase.n.01', 'box.n.01', 'potential.a.01', 'cardboard.n.01', 'issue.n.01', 'simple.a.01', 'power.n.01', 'white.a.01', 'social.a.01', 'strong.a.01', 'statement.n.01', 'render.v.01', 'conceptual.s.01', 'intervention.n.01', 'politics.n.01', 'potential.n.01', 'corporate.s.03', 'house.n.01', 'construct.v.01', 'model.n.01', 'war.n.01', 'political.a.01', 'sculpture.n.01', 'spectator.n.01', 'material.n.01']","['resurrection.n.02', 'powerlessness.n.01', 'containment.n.03', 'language.n.01', 'circulation.n.05', 'text.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/natasha_wheat_be_oblivion_in_disconnect.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/natasha_wheat_be_oblivion_in_disconnect-300x225.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/be-oblivion-in-disconnect/,"['Cultural/7.0537240537240535', 'Material_Physical/3.3321428571428573', 'Society/1.6470588235294117']","['Cultural', 'Material_Physical', 'Society']",12.032925734396322,"['Language/4.746031746031746', 'Arts/1.5384615384615385', 'Time/0.875']","['Language', 'Arts', 'Time']",7.159493284493284,"['Cultural/18.94439759586819', 'Individual_Personal/18.462141779788848', 'Material_Physical/7.177777777777777']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Material_Physical']",44.58431715343481,"['Arts/7.516503267973855', 'Mind/7.374358974358975', 'Culture/4.047008547008547']","['Arts', 'Mind', 'Culture']",18.937870789341375,0.6666666666666666,0.3333333333333333
Hank Willis Thomas,"Like many of his other sculptural works, the source of I am the Greatest is actually a historical photograph of an identical button pin from the 1960s. I am the Greatest presents the famous quote by Mohammad Ali to think about his important presence in the African American community. In dialogue with the painting I am a Man, also in the Kadist collection, this assertion that begins the same way takes the line from the protest poster several steps further. Ali never asserted that he was the greatest boxer or athlete, but had the audacity to claim that he was THE GREATEST [human being] of all time. For a man who grew up in the segregated south to rise to Ali’s iconic status and to be able to confidently and proudly vocalize his superiority was one of the most powerful, symbolic, and memorable moments in the Civil Rights struggle. Monumentally inflating the scale of the button embodies the ‘larger than life’ presence of Ali as an icon for African Americans to stand up and not only assert their humanity, but to be confident in their ability to succeed and rise up against all obstacles society placed in front of them.","Employing the visual language and terminology of mass media, and appropriating symbols and images from popular culture, Hank Willis Thomas’ work seeks to question and subvert established definitions and positions with regards to personal identity and the narrative of race. It is concerned with history and identity, with the way race and ‘blackness’ has not only been informed but deliberately shaped and constructed by various forces – first through colonialism and slavery, and more recently through mass media and advertising – and reminds us of the financial and economic stakes that have always been involved in representations of race. Working across installation, photography, video, and media work, Thomas maintains his photo conceptualist roots, primarily taking source material from found photographs and archives. These images form the basis from which the artist seeks to uncover the fallacies that history claims as truth. His work illustrates how the way history is represented and consumed reinforces generalizations surrounding identity, gender, race and ethnicity, and that as an artist he has an opportunity to expose or to revise those histories from the points of view of the oppressed.",I am the Greatest,Americas,"['presence.n.01', 'protest.n.01', 'struggle.n.01', 'status.n.01', 'poster.n.01', 'dialogue.n.01', 'american.n.01', 'south.n.01', 'symbolic.a.01', 'sculptural.a.01', 'iconic.a.01', 'icon.n.01', 'community.n.01', 'scale.n.01', 'celebrated.s.01', 'moment.n.01', 'beginning.n.04', 'historical.a.01', 'society.n.01', 'human.a.01', 'life.n.01', 'time.n.01', 'photograph.n.01']","['african-american.n.01', 'motto.n.01', 'greatest.s.01', 'best.n.02', 'ali.n.01', 'button.n.04']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/hank_willis_i_am_the_greatest.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/hank_willis_i_am_the_greatest-300x238.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/i-am-the-greatest/,['Material_Physical/0.8'],['Material_Physical'],0.8,['Environmental/0.8'],['Environmental'],0.8,"['Material_Physical/15.632234432234434', 'Society/8.523076923076923', 'Politics/7.584090909090908']","['Material_Physical', 'Society', 'Politics']",31.739402264402262,"['Land/7.255311355311354', 'Materiality/6.038461538461538', 'Urbanization/4.153846153846154']","['Land', 'Materiality', 'Urbanization']",17.447619047619046,0.5,0.0

Jason Meadows,"Jason Meadows’s Do Not Pass Go (2011) depicts Richie Rich, “the poor little rich boy” of the 1950s comic strip. As his steel outline gleefully makes off with a bag of money and a stack of bills, another icon of affluent America, Uncle Pennybags (otherwise known as the Monopoly Man), is crushed underfoot between two heavy blocks. Behind them lies a broken piggy bank, depicted upside down with eyes X-ed out. The scene represents the collision of two fictional worlds—both geared toward children—in which being well moneyed is assumed to be a universal aspiration. With the free market unleashed, these two nostalgic, seemingly innocuous figures are made to compete against one another in a confrontation that begins to read as sinister.","The Los Angeles–based artist Jason Meadows uses found and manufactured objects to craft idiosyncratic assemblages.

Colter Jacobsen,"The title Untitled Passport II was first used by Felix Gonzalez-Torres in an unlimited edition of small booklets, each containing sequenced photographs of a soaring bird against an open sky. Stacked in the shape of a cube and available for visitors to take away, the passports did not offer citizenship, but rather invited participation in a sense of borderless “being.” Colter Jacobsen’s Untitled (Untitled Passport II) is a diptych showing two-page spreads from Gonzalez-Torres’s booklet. The perfect graphite renderings freeze the book with its pages splayed, wings perpetually open. But we cannot help feeling that the boundless generosity of Gonzalez-Torres’s piece finds a limit in Jacobsen’s unique, but copied, original.

His photographs, drawings, and installations are often evocative and possess a certain sublimity. The influence of artists from the Bay Area “Mission School” is manifest in Jacobsen’s predilection for creating installations and assemblages from materials bought in thrift stores, lost personal items found in the urban environment, and recycled packaging with unusual detail.

Among his many powerful and award-winning films are Fitzcarraldo (1982), Grizzly Man (2005), and Cave of Forgotten Dreams (2010).",Hearsay of the Soul,Europe,"['landscape.n.01', 'biennial.n.01', 'huge.s.01', 'digital.a.01', 'universe.n.01', 'music.n.01', 'projection.n.01', 'artwork.n.01', 'representation.n.01']","['pastiche.n.02', 'affectional.s.01', 'landscape.n.03', 'video_recording.n.01', 'projection.n.02', 'art_history.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/werner_herzog_hearsay_of_the_soul.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/werner_herzog_hearsay_of_the_soul-300x186.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/hearsay-of-the-soul/,"['Cultural/19.75137598899209', 'Individual_Personal/2.508771929824561', 'Material_Physical/1.7777777777777777']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Material_Physical']",24.03792569659443,"['Arts/13.262211902304783', 'Technology/3.202614379084967', 'Land/1.7777777777777777']","['Arts', 'Technology', 'Land']",18.24260405916753,"['Material_Physical/12.81794871794872', 'Individual_Personal/12.123529411764709', 'Cultural/8.573926073926074']","['Material_Physical', 'Individual_Personal', 'Cultural']",33.515404203639505,"['Space/6.679487179487179', 'Mind/5.751734539969834', 'Culture/4.038461538461538']","['Space', 'Mind', 'Culture']",16.469683257918554,1.0,0.0
Christopher Badger,"Drowned Wood Standing Coiled (2011) consists of two sculptures, inextricably linked. In each, pieces of driftwood are bundled together vertically and entwined with rope, which cascades to the floor in a tightly wound coil. Placed side by side on the ground, these sculptures anthropomorphize into partners who are literally and figuratively bound. Gracefully composed and energetically poised in relation to one another, they become symbolic of human relationships and our desire for connection.","Christopher Badger begins with a root fascination—a shape, a landscape, or a sound—and then pursues it methodically to its logical, and usually open-ended, conclusion. Though his work touches on timeless questions and engages with “forms as forms,” his process allows for unusual transparency. When he revisits a modernist form, he denies its singularity, pointing to the multiple threads that make it up and the myriad directions in which it could potentially go. Obstinate problems are met with an abundance of hypotheses, each seemingly equally compelling.",Drowned Wood Standing Coiled,Americas,"['sculpture.n.01', 'wood.n.01', 'associate.v.01', 'connection.n.01', 'symbolic.a.01', 'land.n.04', 'floor.n.01', 'relation.n.01', 'desire.n.01', 'relationship.n.01', 'compose.v.01', 'human.a.01', 'piece.n.01']","['bound.a.01', 'being.n.01', 'interconnection.n.01', 'coil.n.01', 'relationship.n.02', 'natural_phenomenon.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/christopher_badger_drowned_wood_standing_coiles_2.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/christopher_badger_drowned_wood_standing_coiles_2-200x300.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/drowned-wood-standing-coiled/,"['Material_Physical/7.456643356643356', 'Cultural/6.338461538461539', 'Individual_Personal/5.818181818181818']","['Material_Physical', 'Cultural', 'Individual_Personal']",19.613286713286712,"['Materiality/3.420745920745921', 'Physics/3.2025641025641027', 'Fantasy/3.2']","['Materiality', 'Physics', 'Fantasy']",9.823310023310025,"['Individual_Personal/12.381618381618384', 'Society/4.974969474969474', 'Cultural/4.920751633986928']","['Individual_Personal', 'Society', 'Cultural']",22.277339490574786,"['Emotion/12.381618381618384', 'Arts/4.14297385620915', 'Community/2.603174603174603']","['Emotion', 'Arts', 'Community']",19.127766841002135,0.6666666666666666,0.0

Daniel Joseph Martinez,"For I use to eat lemon meringue pie till I overloaded on my pancreas with sugar and passed out; It seemed to be a natural response to a society of abundance (1978), also known as the Bodybuilder series, Martinez asked male bodybuilding competitors to pose in whatever position felt “most natural.” They are obviously trained in presenting their ambitiously carved physiques, but their facial expressions seem comparatively unstudied. Against a bare white background, the men appear unexpectedly vulnerable, caught between performance and rehearsal, public and private. While they present themselves deliberately as exemplars of strength, they also inadvertently expose something about the value system that underlies their endeavors—whatever drove them to keep building by tearing tissue, and whatever makes flexing feel like the most honest pose possible.","For more than three decades, the Los Angeles–based artist Daniel Joseph Martinez has used every art medium at his disposal to investigate raw aspects of American culture, dipping adeptly into derangements of body and brain, individual and society. In one well-known piece that he produced for the 1993 Whitney Biennial, he replaced the text on the museum’s admission ticket with the phrase “I Can’t Ever Imagine Wanting to Be White.” Visitors held the sentiment in their hands and kept it in their pockets. In The House America Built (2004), he re-created in exacting detail the cabin in which the Unabomber penned his manifesto. While Martinez’s concepts are tight and concise, they leave ample space to implicate the viewer. His work prompts more than finger pointing; it catalyzes introspection, signaling the necessity of taking stock of one’s own role in perpetuating difficult yet ubiquitous images.",I used to eat lemon meringue pie till I overloaded on my pancreas with sugar and passed out; It seemed to be a natural response to a society of abundance,Americas,"['natural.a.01', 'airs.n.01', 'expression.n.01', 'private.a.01', 'position.n.01', 'background.n.01', 'public.a.01', 'society.n.01', 'white.a.01', 'building.n.01', 'performance.n.01', 'series.n.01']","['brawn.n.01', 'pose.n.02', 'vulnerability.n.01', 'performance.n.02', 'bodybuilder.n.01', 'countenance.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Daniel-Joseph-Martinez_I-use-to-eat-lemon-meringue_273_WEB.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Daniel-Joseph-Martinez_I-use-to-eat-lemon-meringue_273_WEB-206x300.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/i-used-to-eat-lemon-meringue-pie-till-i-overloaded-on-my-pancreas-with-sugar-and-passed-out-it-seemed-to-be-a-natural-response-to-a-society-of-abundance/,"['Politics/2.307692307692308', 'Material_Physical/1.6333333333333333', 'Cultural/0.8421052631578947']","['Politics', 'Material_Physical', 'Cultural']",4.783130904183536,"['Power/2.307692307692308', 'Media/0.8421052631578947', 'Time/0.8333333333333334']","['Power', 'Media', 'Time']",3.983130904183536,"['Cultural/5.368040293040293', 'Society/4.372405372405372', 'Individual_Personal/1.8']","['Cultural', 'Society', 'Individual_Personal']",11.540445665445667,"['Arts/5.368040293040293', 'History/1.746031746031746', 'Identity/1.0']","['Arts', 'History', 'Identity']",8.114072039072038,0.3333333333333333,0.0
Charles Gaines,"To make his series Shadows (1980), Gaines subjected 20 potted plants to a uniform procedure. Each is pictured four times: a photograph of the plant, a photograph of its shadow, a drawing of the plant, and a drawing of its shadow. Instead of lending structure to disparate entities, this system serves a counterintuitive purpose, dissolving the object. Just as meaning can be drained from a word through relentless repetition, Gaines’s thorough application of an invented representational system undermines the thing-ness of the simplest thing. Here, the artist effectively questions a concept as vast as objective truth by presenting an alternate theory of an object as ordinary as a houseplant","Charles Gaines orchestrates opportunities for aesthetic judgments, often turning mundane objects and spaces into newly indeterminate propositions. By adhering to self-defined processes, he explores the structures by which we make meaning, supplanting objective claims with the infinitely interpretable. Gaines is currently based in Los Angeles, where he teaches at California Institute of the Arts. He is influenced by John Cage, and like Cage’s, his work has served as a seminal guidepost for a younger generation of concept-oriented image makers.","Shadows V, Set of 3",Americas,"['shadow.n.01', 'drawing.n.01', 'object.n.01', 'ordinary.a.01', 'huge.s.01', 'times.n.01', 'repeat.n.01', 'purpose.n.01', 'concept.n.01', 'photograph.n.01', 'structure.n.01', 'meaning.n.01', 'question.n.01', 'procedure.n.01', 'series.n.01']","['representation.n.10', 'empty.s.02', 'everyday.s.03', 'language.n.01', 'houseplant.n.01', 'thing.n.12']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/charles_gaines_shadowsvset3.jpeg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/charles_gaines_shadowsvset3-300x118.jpeg,https://kadist.org/work/shadows-v-set-of-3/,"['Cultural/10.040165553400849', 'Society/6.514285714285713', 'Individual_Personal/4.114285714285715']","['Cultural', 'Society', 'Individual_Personal']",20.668736981972277,"['Arts/3.298529411764706', 'Spirituality/3.257142857142857', 'Language/2.658119658119658']","['Arts', 'Spirituality', 'Language']",9.213791927027222,"['Cultural/29.0177494074553', 'Individual_Personal/18.225030525030533', 'Society/12.334798534798537']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Society']",59.57757846728437,"['Arts/9.161080586080585', 'Culture/6.2725274725274724', 'Media/5.667399267399267']","['Arts', 'Culture', 'Media']",21.101007326007327,1.0,0.3333333333333333

Walid Raad,"“The Lebanese wars of the past three decades affected Lebanon’s residents physically and psychologically: from the hundred thousand plus who were killed; to the two hundred thousand plus who were wounded; to the million plus who were displaced; to the even more who were psychologically traumatized. Needless to say, the wars also affected Lebanese cities, buildings and institutions. It is clear to me today that these wars also affected colours, lines, shapes and forms. Some of these were affected in a material way and, like burned books or razed monuments, are physically destroyed and lost forever. Others, like looted treasure or politically compromised artworks, remain physically intact but are removed from view, possibly never to be seen again. And yet other colours, lines, shapes and forms, sensing the forthcoming danger, deploy defensive measures: they hide, take refuge, hibernate, camouflage and dissimulate. I expected them to do so in the artworks of past artists. I thought their paintings, sculptures, films, photographs, and drawings would be their most hospitable hosts. I was wrong. Instead, colours, lines, shapes and forms took refuge in unexpected places. They hid in Roman and Arabic letters and numbers; in circles, rectangles and squares; in yellow, blue and green. They dissimulated as typefaces, covers, titles and indexes; as the graphi  lines and footnotes of books; they camouflaged as letters, price lists, dissertations and catalogues; as diagrams and budgets. They hibernated not in, but around artworks.” Walid Raad in “Miraculous Beginnings”, Whitechapel Gallery, London, 2010, p.94.","Waalid Raad was born in 1967 in Chbanieh, Lebanon.

Her drawings spindle extremities into thin loops of line and her sculptures stack skulls on slabs of clay. The fragile twisting of the body is executed in luxuriously rich materials, which underscore the virtuosity of Piene’s hand and vision. Skeletons on vellum make physical mortality transcendently transparent, and beautiful charcoal lines mark out the uncanny grins of skull-faces.",Armless,Americas,"['line.n.01', 'nothingness.n.01', 'head.n.01', 'name.v.01', 'figure.n.01', 'drawing.n.01', 'form.n.01']","['armless.a.01', 'flesh.n.01', 'disintegrate.v.01', 'figure.n.04', 'inverted.s.01', 'headless.a.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/img-24.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/img-24-185x300.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/armless/,['Cultural/3.2540849673202614'],['Cultural'],3.2540849673202614,"['Design/1.5555555555555556', 'Media/0.875', 'Arts/0.8235294117647058']","['Design', 'Media', 'Arts']",3.254084967320261,"['Cultural/1.7692307692307692', 'Individual_Personal/0.7692307692307693']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal']",2.5384615384615383,"['Arts/1.7692307692307692', 'Identity/0.7692307692307693']","['Arts', 'Identity']",2.5384615384615383,0.6666666666666666,0.4

Pratchaya Phinthong,"Phinthong provided 5,000 Euros to exchange for Zimbabwean dollars, the most devalued and worthless currency in the world. The ZWD has no legal status outside Zimbabwe. The exchange took place through a network of contacts rather than direct with Zimbabweans. The notes he received range from 1 dollar to 50 trillion. Placing the dollars in stacks and the stacks within a square grid, Phinthong mimics serial minimal sculpture thus reworking an old theme while providing an ironic comment on the value of art. From worthless currency the artist makes valuable art. The currency is no good for anything else. Thus what was once valuable but became worthless becomes valuable again, like the phoenix rising from the ashes. The ephemeral nature of the currency is mirrored in the ephemeral substance of the sculpture which is vulnerable to disruption from movements of air. There is no particular order of placing the notes since the work grew over the course of the exhibition as more notes came in. The final sculpture was intended to be a cubic meter of notes. The sculpture questions not only the value of art but also systems of exchange and the degree to which they are reliable. Like other works in the show where this work was unveiled, What I learned … embraces the concept of time since it is a sculpture that was accrued over a long period. Phinthong thereby asserts that sculpture, like film, can be a time-based medium and even to some degree performative.","Pratchaya Phintong’s works often arise from the confrontation between different social, economic, or geographical systems.

Gabriel Orozco,"Gabriel Orozco comments: “In the exhibition [Documenta 11, Kassel, 2002], I tried to connect with the photographs I took in Mali in July. I traveled to Mali for three weeks and took some photographs related to my work. They are very different, but there are links as the graveyard of Timbuktu, which I discovered during the trip. I found the cemetery because I was interested in pottery and ceramics. Research traditions of ceramics were the reason for my trip to Africa in Mali, to understand, learn, appreciate what they did, because it is an important tradition in Mali. And then I discovered the cemetery in Timbuktu. It is interesting to see how the work will take you to discover places you would never have discovered if you did not work. So the link between what you do and what you find in a second time is very interesting. In this context, the exhibition presents one hand tables with ceramics. In addition, photographs of Mali are on the walls. There is no direct link. But it is obvious that the same person who is interested in these things. And there are many reasons for this.","Gabriel Orozco could be described as a traveler-artist, without a fixed studio.

Jean-Luc Moulène,"On a piece of paper, the artist has traced two loops in black crayon and placed two eyes where the lines intersect. Cut out of the same photograph, the eyes belong to the same gaze. The first asset of a slip knot is its simplicity, it basically requires a small length of rope. This collage is “apragmatic drawing, a kind of instructions manual” (« Paragraphes pour Jean-Luc Moulène”, ibid.) of Moulène’s work and photographs. Indeed, doesn’t one commonly speak of the photographer’s gaze? The slip knot could be a “a sort of vision’s hieroglyph”: the eye is the node of everything, the optic nerve is the common thread, the vector of information. This collage questions our gaze which cannot embrace both eyes at once (literally staring in the eyes), which is the point made in the series Les filles d’Amsterdam (photographs of prostitutes which place face and sex organs on the same level). In an interview, the artist analyzes his work by proposing a scenario that activates drawing: “in fact it is the question of the figure. Tracing is always a sharing act, something quite surprising occurs when the line loops back: this reflexivity produces the figure. Then one notices that by pulling the lines to separate the eyes, at a certain point they become stuck; and if one separates other lines then the two eyes end up stuck to one another. It is as if these eyes were rolling around in their own orbits. […] As such, I believe that thought is outside, that there is no room for it in the flesh. The other, social space, outside our bodies: that is what enables us to think”.","After training in literature and working in advertising, Jean-Luc Moulène became known in the 1990s for his ‘documentary’ photographic practice. His images could be considered as studies of natural and cultural phenomena; the Objets de grève ( Strike objects) series (1999) documents objects made in factories during social protests. Moulène uses the codes of media images and diverts them to liberate the gaze and produce a new imaginary. This poetic tactic is manifest in the series called Disjonctions, in which Moulène photographs still lives, portraits, daily urban scenes. The notion of disjunction, which can be interpreted in the grammatical sense (‘or’, ‘either… either…’) or in terms of logic (an alternative in a dilemma), is manifest in the image by the disunity of the elements in the composition. The artist is not just a photographer, he increasingly creates relations with drawing, sculpture, objects, texts and newspapers. As a counterpoint, when asked what unites his work, the artist responds that: “An absurd evidence, a horrible revelation,a burst of laughter…” (Interview with Briony Fer, « Chaque quelconque », ibidem.) His works tend towards evocation rather than fixed meaning, inviting the spectators to invent their own tales in this “community of storytellers and translators” (Jacques Rancière, The Emancipated Spectator).

She wears an expression of both pleasure and intensity as she points a gun at someone or something outside of the frame. Raven (gun) (1994) is not so much threatening as full of sexuality and potential energy. Opie often photographs her friends, of whom Raven is one, and here she captures Raven in the intimate act of role playing. Instead of keeping such activities behind closed doors, Opie brings sexuality fully into view in an effort to question and widen our definition of normalcy.","Since the 1990s, Catherine Opie has been recognized for her use of documentary photography to address issues of community and queerness, and the ways in which identity is shaped by architecture.

Shaun O'Dell,"Shaun O’Dell’s paintings, installations, videos, sculptures, and music explore the overlapping realities of human and natural structures. Whether abstract or figurative, they often read like hieroglyphics, in that they piece together a philosophical portrait of reality. Purple Brush 8 (2011) is a painting that details a meeting of geometric forms, and the optical play that results. The halves of two monochromatic sets of concentric squares meet in the center. The joining of two sides of the forms gives birth to a third image: a diamond shape that radiates outward from the canvas. The work is characteristic of O’Dell’s oeuvre in that a simple gesture results in a much more complex proposition, drawing us deeper into a higher order.","Shaun O’Dell’s drawings, videos, music, and occasional sculpture explore the intertwining realities of human and natural orders.",Purple Brush 8,Americas,"['world.n.03', 'figurative.a.01', 'form.n.01', 'square.n.01', 'set.n.01', 'center.n.01', 'music.n.01', 'complex.a.01', 'abstraction.n.01', 'details.n.01', 'installation.n.01', 'natural.a.01', 'portrayal.n.01', 'play.n.01', 'gesture.n.01', 'simple.a.01', 'shape.n.01', 'structure.n.01', 'sculpture.n.01', 'video.n.01', 'image.n.01']","['dimensionality.n.01', 'geometric.s.01', 'gesture.n.03', 'optical_illusion.n.01', 'symbology.n.01', 'monochrome.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/shaun_odell_purple_brush8.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/shaun_odell_purple_brush8-300x300.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/purple-brush-8/,"['Cultural/9.17905056759546', 'Material_Physical/2.6', 'Individual_Personal/1.5555555555555556']","['Cultural', 'Material_Physical', 'Individual_Personal']",13.334606123151016,"['Arts/5.920880632954937', 'Technology/1.6470588235294117', 'Mind/1.5555555555555556']","['Arts', 'Technology', 'Mind']",9.123495012039903,"['Cultural/28.193157006392315', 'Individual_Personal/13.982965237377005', 'Society/12.285817106869741']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Society']",54.461939350639064,"['Arts/11.567515980751278', 'Culture/6.931623931623932', 'Mind/5.648351648351648']","['Arts', 'Culture', 'Mind']",24.147491560726856,0.6666666666666666,0.6666666666666666

Gareth Moore,Uncertain Pilgrimage is an ongoing project in which Moore draws from his unplanned travels in recent years. Many of the pieces are found objects and discarded materials that he has transformed into tools and eccentric prop-like sculptures to help him on his journeys. Map (from Uncertain Pilgrimage) is one such object that could be a metaphor for the whole project: a simple empty paper map that has no location written on it.,"Gareth Moore’s practice—which explores ideas of journey and loss—combines performance, documentation, installation, and sculpture, as well as everyday activities. For the exhibition The Wizard of Oz at California College of the Arts’s Wattis Institute, Moore was blindfolded and deposited in an unknown location with only the clothes on his back, some pocket money, and a camera to find his own way back to the gallery.","Map (from Uncertain Pilgrimage), 2006-2009",Americas,"['map.n.01', 'undertaking.n.01', 'object.n.01', 'metaphor.n.01', 'write.v.01', 'location.n.01', 'journey.n.01', 'tool.n.01', 'simple.a.01', 'paper.n.01', 'sculpture.n.01', 'material.n.01', 'piece.n.01']","['empty.a.01', 'journey.n.01', 'map.n.01', 'uncertainty.n.01', 'tool.n.01', 'nowhere.r.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/gareth_moore_map_from_uncertain_pilgrimage_2006-2009.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/gareth_moore_map_from_uncertain_pilgrimage_2006-2009-300x201.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/map-from-uncertain-pilgrimage-2006-2009/,"['Cultural/5.855392156862745', 'Individual_Personal/3.155555555555556', 'Material_Physical/2.423529411764706']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Material_Physical']",11.434477124183006,"['Arts/2.475', 'Media/1.7333333333333334', 'Design/1.6470588235294117']","['Arts', 'Media', 'Design']",5.855392156862745,"['Cultural/13.376143790849676', 'Material_Physical/11.0164476046829', 'Politics/4.781787802840434']","['Cultural', 'Material_Physical', 'Politics']",29.17437919837301,"['Arts/6.617973856209151', 'Land/3.977777777777778', 'Economy/2.6223684210526317']","['Arts', 'Land', 'Economy']",13.21812005503956,0.6666666666666666,0.3333333333333333

Paul McCarthy,"To make Mickey Mouse (2010), Paul McCarthy altered a found photograph—not of the iconic cartoon, but of a man costumed as Mickey. On his shoulders he supports an enormous false head, Mickey’s familiar face grinning with glossy eyes. The artist has marked out in heavy black the background of Cinderella’s castle. Robbed of his context, the character becomes the sole focus of the image, a subject of unusual scrutiny. Under this close examination, his torso and legs begin to seem strange—too human for his extremities—and his friendly wave starts to look less like that of a childhood hero and more like that of a politician. With McCarthy’s intervention, the famous mouse is upstaged by his own artificiality.","Known for his transgressive performance art pieces that often challenge social conventions, Paul McCarthy is undoubtedly one of the main figures in the West Coast contemporary art scene. Using different forms from pop culture as source material, McCarthy casts a critical look at American society and consumerism.

Miri Segal,"The work BRB is a 30 min. journey in the new game world of Second Life (“SL”). Consistent with Segal’s work with the projected image, this video was shot using a virtual in-world camera, with the footage later being transformed by a software custom designed by the artist. The video explores the idea of masks we wear in SL and real life (“RL”), and the differences in communication within those two worlds. When somebody “speaks,” his or her avatar is seen typing, a mechanical ticking sound is heard, and words appear as text on the screen, strengthening the feeling that the conversation is taking place inside of our head. The video creates a new relation to the body and a new form of intimacy. We seem to engage this new form by chance, using the game’s search engine Segal’s avatar sometimes appears with a Google search page as a mask, perhaps as a salute to another icon of cyber culture. With BRB, roaming in SL is like wandering inside our collective sub-conscious.","Miri Segal’s work relates to questions concerning the nature of life, the role of images, and the relationship between the two, whilst systematically exposing the nuances of perception. Her work generally focuses on the video medium, though Segal claims not to be a video artist, rather as a scholar of phenomena, from the laws of math to those of awareness and consciousness. Her video installations incorporate playful tricks, diversions, or deceptions. Such is the case with Closed Circuit (2000), a work depicting a dancing woman hugging herself. Looking closer, images of the woman are shot from front and back and then projected from opposite sides of the room onto a sheet of glass, so that her two sides overlap, back turning into front, front turning into back. The effect is that the woman’s arms appear as if they encircle her own body. Another work, a more technically elaborate musing on illusion, Foreshadowing (2001), uses complex modeling software to create and operate a synthetic image of a spinning roulette wheel. Screened high above viewers’ heads, the wheel is intermittently overlaid by a seemingly random number, flashed so briefly as to be nearly subliminal, which none the less always reliably ‘predicts’ the winner. With each round the ostensibly chance-determined outcome of the game invariably fulfills the expectations of the tipped-off viewer.  Miri Segal was born in Haifa, Israel, in 1965 and currently lives and works in Tel Aviv.","BRB (""be right back"")",Middle East & Africa,"['embodiment.n.01', 'search.n.01', 'game.n.01', 'video.n.01', 'form.n.01', 'project.v.01', 'opportunity.n.01', 'life.n.01', 'virtual.s.01', 'feeling.n.01', 'head.n.01', 'footage.n.01', 'universe.n.01', 'shoot.v.01', 'journey.n.01', 'icon.n.01', 'relation.n.01', 'sound.n.01', 'screen.n.01', 'corporate.s.03', 'real.a.01', 'body.n.01', 'idea.n.01', 'culture.n.01', 'camera.n.01']","['closeness.n.01', 'virtual_reality.n.01', 'human_body.n.01', 'communication.n.01', 'conversation.n.01', 'subconscious.s.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/img-371.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/img-371-300x208.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/brb-be-right-back/,"['Cultural/12.747124220808432', 'Politics/6.923076923076923', 'Individual_Personal/5.857142857142858']","['Cultural', 'Politics', 'Individual_Personal']",25.527344001028215,"['Media/4.208662682346893', 'Language/4.076923076923077', 'Power/3.076923076923077']","['Media', 'Language', 'Power']",11.362508836193047,"['Individual_Personal/46.67657897657896', 'Material_Physical/27.59650937297997', 'Society/21.63661251029672']","['Individual_Personal', 'Material_Physical', 'Society']",95.90970085985566,"['Emotion/16.20979020979021', 'Space/13.849170437405732', 'Spirituality/11.193772893772895']","['Emotion', 'Space', 'Spirituality']",41.25273354096883,0.3333333333333333,0.0
Fikret Atay,"In the video Rebels of the Dance, two boys are filmed dancing to traditional Kurdish songs inside of the confined space of an ATM. Shy, proud and joyful, the two boys appear to be influenced by a third person – the artist and his camera. Their play of eyes creates an atmosphere reminding one of the close scrutiny and state control of the Kurdish population. While Atay films, the music grows and intensifies, and the ATM machine becomes a simple decor for the scene, losing its proper function. As if in a state of triumph, music and dance take on the role of a new language of power, juxtaposing local identity with an international dimension of the city and country. This simple performance gives meaning to the geographical and political situation of Batman, whose oil resources are rich, although its citizens rarely reap benefit from its natural wealth.  *This title is a variation of a televised transmission representing 90 folk dancers “Sultans of the Dance” which was a big success in Turkey.","It is said that the artist Fikret Atay secretly stole his parent’s camera to film the city of Batman and its citizens in East Turkey. His first experiments later transformed themselves into his first videos such as Fast and Best (2002) and Rebels of the Dance (2002). The city of Batman is a mid-sized Turkish city situated on the border with Irak. Its geographical and political situation inevitably contextualizes the work of Atay and inside of this context is Atay’s focus on the city’s citizens, its communities and traditions, whether linguistic, family orientated, musical or religious. Camera in hand, Atay makes short videos of everyday life. Despite the fact that they are direct and spontaneous, the images conserve an ambiguity, at times mysterious from a outsider’s point of view. In this regard, Atay translates reality while adhering to a larger grain of complexity. Fikret Atay was born in Batman, Turkey in 1976.

Eleanor Antin,"Comprised of fifty-one photographic postcards, Antin’s 100 Boots is an epic visual narrative in which 100 black rubber boots stand in for a fictional “hero” making a “trip” from California to New York City. Over two-and-a-half years, Antin photographed the boots against different backdrops across the U.S., and then turned the pictures into postcards, which she then mailed to approximately 1,000 people around the world. In conjunction with the boots’ “arrival” in New York City, the postcards were exhibited at the Museum of Modern Art. The project speaks not only to the reproduction and dissemination of images, but also about how the material reality of the images—their settings and their existence in mailboxes—was in stark contrast to the everyday lives of the people who received the cards. As with all “mail art” which had begun with the Fluxus movement in the late 1950s and was on the rise in the late 1960s, using the postal service enabled artists to completely bypass the traditional art-world distribution system, and allowed Antin to expand or compress time as the narrative required.","Over a roughly thirty-year period, conceptual and multidisciplinary artist Eleanor Antin has been creating narrative images in photography, video, film, performance, and installation. Her practices blur fiction and history, often with humorous wit, theatrical sensibility, and allegorical impulse. During her early career, Antin was associated with a group of artists who were recognized for returning the element of narrative to contemporary art, which until the 1970s had been dominated by highly abstract, purist work.",100 Boots,Americas,"['new_york.n.01', 'york.n.01', 'people.n.01', 'narrative.n.01', 'city.n.01', 'material.s.01', 'trip.n.01', 'fictional.a.01', 'contrast.n.01', 'california.n.01', 'traditional.a.01', 'museum.n.01', 'picture.n.01', 'artist.n.01', 'everyday.s.01', 'motion.n.03', 'black.a.01', 'photographic.a.01', 'world.n.03', 'undertaking.n.01', 'ocular.a.02', 'life.n.01', 'time.n.01']","['hero.n.02', 'distribution.n.03', 'journey.n.01', 'materiality.n.02', 'bypass.v.01', 'stand-in.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/img-560.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/img-560-235x300.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/100-boots/,"['Politics/9.32708694813958', 'Cultural/6.323676323676323', 'Society/4.793522267206478']","['Politics', 'Cultural', 'Society']",20.44428553902238,"['Power/3.076923076923077', 'Activism/3.0695970695970693', 'Arts/2.3493173493173494']","['Power', 'Activism', 'Arts']",8.495837495837495,"['Society/19.7148725887116', 'Material_Physical/14.688084464555057', 'Cultural/13.464935554641439']","['Society', 'Material_Physical', 'Cultural']",47.867892607908104,"['Urbanization/8.796898732502447', 'Geopolitics/7.254715219421101', 'Land/7.224836601307189']","['Urbanization', 'Geopolitics', 'Land']",23.276450553230738,0.6666666666666666,0.0
Joe Scanlan,"Spring Line is a piece shown for the first time in his solo exhibition at the Institut d’Art Contemporain in Villeurbanne in 2007. It pays homage to the work of the famous conceptual artist Sol LeWitt, who had died on 8 April that year. Scanlan aims to guide the spectator to gage the level of influence Sol LeWitt has had on his work with regards the conversion of potential ideas into sculpture. Forsythia stems, a theme in his work of the last 7 years, are seen as concrete drawings where each stem is a line in space and each flower a mark. Taking the concept of Sol LeWitt’s instructions in which the artwork exists first as an idea before realization, Spring Line applies the same principle by which an artwork exists first of all as a mobile box prior to installation. The way in which the drawings are exhibited in space can vary: in Villeurbanne they were dispersed, during the Armory Show the stems all stayed in the box, in Amsterdam only 5 drawings were created, the other stems stayed in the box. Thus Spring Line is a variable image which is adaptable to any space and reinvented each time. The forsythia motif resonates with this idea, since it is a flower that renews itself constantly in the cycle of seasons – eternal and forever new.","Joe Scanlan became known in the 1990s due to his very particular appropriation of Conceptual art, exploiting two main registers: display on one hand, designating the artwork as a consumable product, DIY on the other, advocating the mobility and adaptability of objects, even their reversibility depending on contexts and usages. Scanlan’s work turns out to be reversible. A shelf can appear to be a minimal construction and be used as a shelf, as implied by functional logic. The technical simplicity of Scanlan’s realizations purposely leaning towards low-tech, with subsidiary possibilities for most of them to be de-installed and stored with no difficulty, convey something practical (art can be concretely useful) and aesthetic (each one of the artist’s creations carries a specific function but also has its own plastic qualities) in the work. Thus Joe Scanlan’s practice involves strategies that question the market and the value of a work of art. Extremely surprised by the attitude of students who are already wooed by galleries while they are still training, he invents Donnelle Woolford, a fictional artist he launches in the art world (with exhibitions, press articles, CV, facebook page, etc.). Beyond the conceptual aspect of his work, his approach focuses on the ephemeral nature of things, objects, lives. The artist’s recent research, into the production of snowflakes or reconstituted forsythias, reveal his constant interest in what is transitory or ephemeral. This poetic tendency is becoming more and more present in Scanlan’s work which always combines critical and independent standpoints.",Spring Line,Americas,"['box.n.01', 'idea.n.01', 'drawing.n.01', 'artwork.n.01', 'space.n.01', 'mark.n.01', 'potential.a.01', 'time.n.01', 'motif.n.01', 'conceptual.s.01', 'ageless.s.01', 'solo.n.01', 'concept.n.01', 'degree.n.01', 'celebrated.s.01', 'subject.n.01', 'make.v.03', 'sculpture.n.01', 'spectator.n.01', 'piece.n.01']","['adaptation.n.02', 'influence.n.04', 'idea.n.01', 'stalk.n.02', 'flower.n.01', 'variation.n.07']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/img-684.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/img-684-232x300.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/spring-line/,"['Individual_Personal/13.314285714285717', 'Cultural/5.728937728937728', 'Material_Physical/3.228937728937729']","['Individual_Personal', 'Cultural', 'Material_Physical']",22.272161172161177,"['Values/5.12967032967033', 'Mind/5.107692307692307', 'Culture/3.269230769230769']","['Values', 'Mind', 'Culture']",13.506593406593407,"['Cultural/29.445313346783944', 'Individual_Personal/25.322344322344332', 'Material_Physical/7.112820512820512']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Material_Physical']",61.88047818194879,"['Culture/8.811843711843713', 'Values/8.577289377289377', 'Arts/8.45206476530006']","['Culture', 'Values', 'Arts']",25.841197854433148,1.0,0.6666666666666666
Harun Farocki,"For Immersion, Harun Farocki went to visit a research centre near Seattle specialized in the development of virtual realities and computer simulations. One of their projects consists in using virtual reality (environments created to simulate this world) for therapeutic reasons for soldiers suffering traumas after the Iraq war. The double projection creates a parallel between animations and testimonies by soldiers reliving their mission, the explosions, gunshots and ambushes, their fears and their guilt. The chosen direct rendering and simplicity of the edit places us like the voyeur of a personal and difficult experience. The end is disconcerting since the last soldier, who one minute had been pleading his therapist to stop the program, looks at his audience and smiles with a detachment that sheds doubt on the authenticity of his account. The Virtual Iraq program is closer to a virtual game than a therapeutic program. Immersion continues to explore the impact of new technologies on society, the relations between virtual reality and the military world and how the scenarios developed as video games are used as training tools as much as a therapy. (Read Artslant)","In the 1970s and 80s, the feature films Harun Farocki made contributed to theorizing essay-films, a cinema genre that juxtaposes archival images of different sources (news, film industry) with voiceover commentaries. More specifically it is a critical and political approach to the image that has characterized his oeuvre since the start, a point of view on the connections between war, technology and capitalism. In 1969, he makes one of his first films in 16mm called Inextinguishable Fire in which he appears as a TV presenter reading out the testimony of a Vietnamese victim of a Napalm attack. The subsequent images are like an educational documentary, an austere thesis on the origins of napalm production and the involvement of workers, students and engineers in what was largely used as a weapon against civilians. Years later, for the trilogy Eye/Machine (2001-2003), Farocki collects sequences filmed during the Gulf War, like images from projectiles, juxtaposed with images produced by machines made for surveillance, recognition and localization. The art historian Hal Foster describes Farocki’s work like a genealogy of ‘visual instrumentalization’ following the evolution of image technologies and their roles in power struggles and the exercise of control. At the beginning of the 1990s he begins to imagine double projections that were presented in cinemas and soon in galleries and institutions that could easily adapt to this mode of projection. The evolution of the forms of presentation and distribution of his work explains his presence in various economies and most recently that of the art market.  Harun Farocki was born in 1944 in Neutitschein, Czech Republic. He lived and worked in Berlin where he passed away in 2014.","Serious Games 3, Immersion",Europe,"['virtual.s.01', 'soldier.n.01', 'plan.n.01', 'world.n.03', 'game.n.01', 'technology.n.01', 'rendition.n.01', 'development.n.01', 'impact.n.01', 'audience.n.01', 'scenario.n.01', 'direct.a.01', 'research.v.02', 'military.a.01', 'tool.n.01', 'environment.n.01', 'projection.n.01', 'personal.a.01', 'war.n.01', 'society.n.01', 'undertaking.n.01', 'experience.n.01', 'make.v.03']","['posttraumatic_stress_disorder.n.01', 'voyeurism.n.01', 'virtual_reality.n.01', 'testimony.n.02', 'computer_game.n.01', 'therapy.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/img-649.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/img-649-300x168.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/immersion/,"['Cultural/6.273821809425524', 'Society/1.0', 'Individual_Personal/1.0']","['Cultural', 'Society', 'Individual_Personal']",8.273821809425524,"['Media/3.548675610595115', 'Technology/1.9473684210526314', 'Body/1.0']","['Media', 'Technology', 'Body']",6.496044031647747,"['Cultural/26.237082525317824', 'Society/20.95160133983664', 'Individual_Personal/18.17528058456851']","['Cultural', 'Society', 'Individual_Personal']",65.36396444972297,"['Culture/9.534065934065936', 'Arts/5.845751633986929', 'Mind/5.746606334841629']","['Culture', 'Arts', 'Mind']",21.126423902894494,1.0,0.0
Thea Djordjadze,"The sculpture And Shadows Will Follow is an angle piece that articulates a space since its appearance highly changes depending on the point of view.

Mathilde Rosier,"Rosier’s body of films, gleam with that indeterminate in-between glow of twilight. Things hardly move at all in her films. They are, quite simply, often without plot, without spoken voice and without narrative elements. Such is the case of Far from Honolulu (2003), a film exploring the plight of intuition and emotion inside the idea of the sea journey. In the film, a pensive and reflective man is depicted playing guitar at sea as well as from inside a boat looking outward. Airy and divine-like, he is shown sleeping, in a trance state, staring out to the ocean, waiting for the journey to pass, progress, in order to arrive somewhere, but where? There is mention of Recife, Brazil, but one gets the sense that figure and place is almost other-worldly or mythic. This is further highlighted by the repetitious sound of the ocean’s waves. The ending of the film is quite arbitrary, expressing a clear desire to not illustrate an end or a narrative, but another kind of vacant agency close to immediacy and the present.","Mathilde Rosier’s oeuvre arguably skirts the line between real and fiction. Not in the sense of plausible but fake alternative histories or but rather, hers are theatrical renderings in film, performance, painting or sculpture. The cultivation of illusion and ambiguity, as a counter to the concrete veracity of factual things, is one of Mathilde Rosier’s persistent concerns. The artworks that result seem decidedly uncontemporary; without attempting to be nostalgic per se, they appear out of our time or quaint. Pastel-colored watercolors of birds attached to hats, melodic musical scores, videos permeated with the haze of twilight: the artist would tell you that her art sits at the limit of the “acceptable,” as it is at times too charmingly pretty and too apparently inoffensive to fit in an art world that often privileges other qualities. But behind the apparent naivety of her fantastical world is a force that deceives or, indeed, that makes deception the very thread that binds her work together.

Nathaniel Dorsky,"Dorsky’s pieces included in the Kadist Collection are small still photographs from twelve of his most important films. Here, the still images function in the same way as his cinematographic work: Highly aesthetic, they allow for the appearance of intricate visual patterns and layers of meaning that take scenes of everyday life as its source material.

Bjorn Copeland,"Sign #1, Sign #2, Sign #3 were included in “Found Object Assembly”, Copeland’s 2009 solo show at Jack Hanley Gallery, San Francisco. These rather austere collages were created by simply cutting and inverting the text from existing information signs. In Sign #2, for example, the original image that presumably carried the message “NO RIDERS” was placed upside down. By cutting out some of the syllables and inverting and rearranging them, the message was rendered unreadable. By maintaining the overall integrity of the signs and their most legible visual characteristics (luminescent color, bold font, size and rectangular format), Copeland’s collages obscure language in favor of a “delirious optical disorientation.”","Bjorn Copeland (along with his brother Eric) is an original member of Black Dice, an experimental/noise band associated with the thriving musical movement around the Rhode Island School of Design (RISD) in the late 1990s. Not surprisingly, Copeland’s visual practice is connected to that music scene, most obviously in his use of psychedelic designs associated with concert flyers which deploy hypnotic, almost acid-driven pop referents in a certain “op” manner. In many of his recent assemblages and collages, Copeland reuses discarded products, accumulated and found debris, as well as product packaging. As with his music, he rearranges and re-composes these preexisting structures, building complicated and intricate abstract patterns that aim to disorient and play with the viewer’s perception.","Sign series, #1, #2, #3",Americas,"['sign.n.01', 'message.n.01', 'size.n.01', 'render.v.01', 'solo.n.01', 'format.n.01', 'include.v.01', 'language.n.01', 'collage.n.01', 'color.n.01', 'original.s.01', 'ocular.a.02', 'make.v.03', 'object.n.01', 'image.n.01']","['street_sign.n.01', 'disorient.v.01', 'language.n.01', 'text.n.01', 'cut.v.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/bjorn_copeland_sign_1.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/bjorn_copeland_sign_1-300x225.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/sign-series-123/,['Cultural/7.0537240537240535'],['Cultural'],7.0537240537240535,"['Language/4.746031746031746', 'Arts/1.5384615384615385', 'Culture/0.7692307692307693']","['Language', 'Arts', 'Culture']",7.0537240537240535,"['Cultural/15.626490339725637', 'Individual_Personal/8.978368999421631', 'Society/7.2835164835164825']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Society']",31.88837582266375,"['Culture/3.964835164835165', 'Media/3.4552197802197804', 'Spirituality/3.257142857142857']","['Culture', 'Media', 'Spirituality']",10.677197802197803,0.5,0.3333333333333333

Judy Chicago,"Domes #1 represents a significant moment in Chicago’s career when her art began to change from a New York-influenced Abstract Expressionist style to one that reflected the pop-inflected art being made in Los Angeles. By 1968, the year she began creating Domes, the twenty-nine-year-old artist had moved from Chicago to Los Angeles, graduated from UCLA, and was part of a generation of artists whose work was characterized by of the masculine overtones of Southern California’s flourishing car culture. Inspired by new technologies in the auto manufacturing, these “Finish Fetish” artists appropriated industrial materials such as car paint or lacquer to create artwork with pristine finishes. Chicago too was interested in using industrial technologies and enrolled in auto body and boat building school. While the geometric forms, meticulously applied finish, and luminous, gradated hues of color in Domes speak to Chicago’s interest in the prevailing artistic themes of 1960s Southern California, its intimate scale, round shape, and triangular formation belie her career-long interest in using “feminine” forms to promote feminist issues.","In the 1970s Judy Chicago and Miriam Schapiro founded the Feminist Art Program at CSU Fresno, which later moved to CalArts in Los Angeles. As a result of her art work and pedagogy, Chicago is the most recognizable feminist artist who gave an authentic voice to women’s experiences and their important contributions to human society and culture. In addition to expanding women’s rights to encompass a greater freedom of artistic expression, Chicago expanded the definition of art and the role of all artists. Her earliest forays into the art world coincided with the rise of Minimalism, and the Los Angeles-based Finish Fetish movement, which she eventually abandoned in favor of an art practice believed to have greater content and relevance.","Domes, #1",Americas,"['technology.n.01', 'car.n.01', 'los_angeles.n.01', 'industrial.a.01', 'california.n.01', 'artist.n.01', 'form.n.01', 'school.n.01', 'change.v.01', 'coevals.n.01', 'geometric.s.01', 'paint.n.01', 'abstraction.n.01', 'issue.n.01', 'scale.n.01', 'inspire.v.01', 'artwork.n.01', 'color.n.01', 'shape.n.01', 'moment.n.01', 'body.n.01', 'building.n.01', 'subject.n.01', 'manner.n.01', 'culture.n.01']","['femininity.n.01', 'fabrication.n.04', 'polish.n.02', 'closeness.n.01', 'hue.n.01', 'feminism.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/judy_chicago_domes.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/judy_chicago_domes-300x267.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/domes-1/,"['Individual_Personal/9.124903038138333', 'Cultural/2.42483660130719', 'Society/1.0']","['Individual_Personal', 'Cultural', 'Society']",12.549739639445523,"['Emotion/2.6263736263736264', 'Mind/2.423529411764706', 'Spirituality/1.6']","['Emotion', 'Mind', 'Spirituality']",6.649903038138332,"['Individual_Personal/20.11749084249085', 'Material_Physical/17.536752136752146', 'Cultural/17.093090406325704']","['Individual_Personal', 'Material_Physical', 'Cultural']",54.747333385568695,"['Mind/6.488644688644689', 'Space/6.346153846153846', 'Arts/6.1324066456419395']","['Mind', 'Space', 'Arts']",18.967205180440473,0.6666666666666666,0.3333333333333333
Jiang Zhi,"In the video installation Tremble, Jiang projected the life-size images of seven naked men and women onto seven individual screens. Each person displays a different facial expression and body position such as reading a book, arms open for a hug, holding a knife, raising a fist to take an oath. Each gesture reflects some essential social aspect of everyday life: hugging is about caring, taking oath has to do with politics, reading relates to acquiring knowledge, and raising a knife indicates violence. As a result of a hidden vibration machine, the images’ projection screens oscillate vigorously and the contradiction between the shaking screens and the static human figures creates an absurd effect. Through this imposed trembling, Jiang suggests the invisible power that controls modern human behavior. These seemly “out-of-control” actions are often ironically conceived as the most adaptable and mutually-agreed upon tenets of social activity.","Jiang Zhi represents a generation of artists whose practice developed against the backdrop of experimental art in China in the 1990s, during which a series of social and cultural transformation occurred in the country. His work actively deals with issues such as body, gender, identity, consumerism, conflict, fear, power, and temporality, and often involves recent social events. Jiang attended the China Academy of Art and has long been engaged with writing and video art. From 1995 to 2005, Jiang was also an active journalist, which had him on the frontlines of his country’s the social transformation, and all of his experiences have deeply influenced the language and context of his practice.

Qing Zhang,"603 Football Field presents a soccer game played inside a small student apartment in Shanghai. Installed like monitors fed by surveillance cameras, the videos present a voyeuristic entry into a private space, where two teams of men are scurrying around a bed, a desk, and some shelves in to score a goal, represented by a kitchen at one end and bathroom at the other. The game is furnished with complete uniforms, a referee, and a midfield line. Initially, the game appears as a whimsical solution to urban ennui. Yet, as the players shuffle the ball around, recklessly knocking down items in the apartment, the viewer begins to wonder if the indoor game marks the increase of air pollution, and the erasure of green space by real estate development has forced all leisure activity to be conducted in the prison of one’s apartment under surveillance.","Zhang Qing is a conceptual artist living and working in Shanghai after graduating from the Changzhou Institute of Technology. Zhang’s works deploy a variety of motifs and styles, at times dabbling in gender-bending photography and engaging in endurance-performances. Particularly, Zhang uses humor as an access point to expose the darker sides of capitalism in works such as Don’t Go So Fast (2009), social commentary on the state of economic disparity among social classes.

Etel Adnan,"Adnan’s paintings are simple images with bold contrasting colors and rich textures. This particular work has an iconic feel and a strong physical presence in spite of its diminutive size. All of her paintings are small but, like Howard Hodgkin’s work, their intensity gains from their diminutive size. However small they are, they are large in scale and impact. This painting may recall the sunset in Beirut just as it refers to a small confined but defined mass within a larger sea, perhaps in itself some kind of political statement. It is stark in its contrasts but rich in color. The central pattern of horizontal bands may recall national flags, however without referring to any one in particular. Unlike Albers’s work, there is no sense of gradation of color nor forms increasing or decreasing in size but, like Albers, Adnan is manifestly interested in the way in which one color may influence and impact another. A tension between the expansive and the restricted and between the horizontal and the vertical make this a very satisfying and dynamic image.","Etel Adnan was born on February 24,1925 in Beirut. Lebanese American artist and writer, she presently lives and works in Paris. Since the 1960s, Etel Adnan has been making accordion-fold books, or leporellos, that meld visual and verbal observation, fusing the artist’s parallel practices in painting and writing as she transcribes poems and records unfolding landscapes and urban spaces.",Untitled (Beirut),Middle East & Africa,"['size.n.01', 'color.n.01', 'vertical.a.01', 'strong.a.01', 'statement.n.01', 'flag.n.01', 'form.n.03', 'sea.n.01', 'impact.n.01', 'iconic.a.01', 'contrast.n.01', 'tension.n.01', 'colors.n.01', 'scale.n.01', 'physical.a.01', 'simple.a.01', 'presence.n.01', 'cardinal.s.01', 'sense.n.01', 'image.n.01', 'political.a.01', 'form.n.01']","['tension.n.03', 'abstraction.n.04', 'color.n.01', 'horizontal.n.01', 'bayrut.n.01', 'vertical.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/adnan_137-untitled_beirut_2010_oil_on_canvas_24x30cm.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/adnan_137-untitled_beirut_2010_oil_on_canvas_24x30cm-300x200.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/untitled-beirut/,"['Cultural/3.4960440316477466', 'Material_Physical/2.7333333333333334', 'Society/1.8']","['Cultural', 'Material_Physical', 'Society']",8.02937736498108,"['Arts/3.4960440316477466', 'Materiality/1.8333333333333335', 'Urbanization/1.8']","['Arts', 'Materiality', 'Urbanization']",7.12937736498108,"['Cultural/12.507620320855617', 'Material_Physical/7.688644688644688', 'Individual_Personal/7.288644688644688']","['Cultural', 'Material_Physical', 'Individual_Personal']",27.484909698144993,"['Materiality/5.293040293040293', 'Fantasy/4.175757575757576', 'Mind/3.195604395604396']","['Materiality', 'Fantasy', 'Mind']",12.664402264402263,0.6666666666666666,0.3333333333333333

Taus Makhacheva,"For Taus Makhacheva, the wild, untamed side of human nature is often the foundation of many of her formal investigations. A leading voice of the younger generation based in Moscow, Makhacheva works with sculpture and installation while her preferred medium remains video. Her Dagestani (Northern Caucasian) roots draw her to this rugged land as her site of choice for many of her works. She digs into the cultural shifts and changes that overwhelmed this land during a state of post-soviet disorientation. While turning to a lost past, the sense of nostalgia in her work is often overcome by an urgency to invent new traditions and rituals. Tackling head on issues of assimilation, morphing customs and gender politics, her performances and video installations reveal a strong sense of human dignity and pride.  A seminal work in her long line of investigations of the Dagestani identity, the three-channel video installation Let me be part of a narrative looks at the all-male dog fighting championship set up alongside a Soviet documentary of Ali Aliev, the five-time world wrestling champion from Dagestan. Seemingly disparate at first, both games expose a need to diffuse aggression, revealing a strict code of play and conduct such as ‘not showing teeth’ or ‘not hiding the tail’. The training of the Caucasian sheep dogs based on raising them to stand up to wolves, a strong force of nature they must face within themselves. For the dog breeders, the fight becomes a form of self-validation and assertion within the group. A girl breeder expands the narrative with her own search for respect, arguing that the winning characteristics are carried through the maternal line.","Born 1983 in Moscow, Russia Lives and works between Makhachkala, Dagestan and Moscow, Russia",Let Me Be Part of a Narrative,Europe,"['land.n.01', 'probe.n.01', 'strong.a.01', 'narrative.s.01', 'nature.n.01', 'establish.v.08', 'sense.n.01', 'human.a.01', 'video.n.01', 'white.n.01', 'girl.n.01', 'voice.n.01', 'search.n.01', 'ritual.n.01', 'head.n.01', 'shift.n.01', 'put.v.01', 'documentary.n.01', 'coevals.n.01', 'politics.n.01', 'battle.n.01', 'lose.v.01', 'issue.n.01', 'game.n.01', 'installation.n.01']","['sex.n.04', 'dignity.n.01', 'fight.n.02', 'soviet.a.01', 'game.n.01', 'culture.n.06']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/3_taus_makhacheva_let_me_be_part_of_a_narrative.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/3_taus_makhacheva_let_me_be_part_of_a_narrative-300x169.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/let-me-be-part-narrative/,"['Individual_Personal/13.132234432234435', 'Society/9.216849816849816', 'Cultural/7.595604395604395']","['Individual_Personal', 'Society', 'Cultural']",29.944688644688647,"['Emotion/6.217948717948718', 'Spirituality/3.257142857142857', 'Power/2.6654761904761903']","['Emotion', 'Spirituality', 'Power']",12.140567765567766,"['Society/25.266409897292252', 'Cultural/23.965244559362212', 'Individual_Personal/21.58885297708828']","['Society', 'Cultural', 'Individual_Personal']",70.82050743374275,"['Culture/9.240379228614524', 'Spirituality/8.052747252747254', 'Media/6.706765783236371']","['Culture', 'Spirituality', 'Media']",23.99989226459815,1.0,0.3333333333333333
Tim Lee,"Tim Lee’s two-channel video installation Party for Your Right to Fight, Public Enemy, 1988 (2006) combines the strategies of two very different artists: Bruce Nauman and Public Enemy. The side-by-side monitors (which are disorientingly out of sync) play a video of a close-up of Lee’s head reciting Public Enemy lyrics. In a further spin, Lee’s head is upside down and revolving—counterclockwise on one screen and clockwise on the other—like a pair of malfunctioning record turntables. In this, Lee is referencing Bruce Nauman’s multichannel installation Anthro-Socio (1992), which features a man’s head rotating as he calls out commands to the viewer. By resampling and conflating the works of these two artists, Lee momentarily conjoins conceptual video art and radical hip-hop, leading the viewer to search (perhaps in vain, perhaps not) for similarities between them.","Vancouver-based artist Tim Lee employs a wide range of media, including photography, video, installation, and performance to revisit and reinterpret—often humorously—particular historical moments through a constellation of references.","Party for your right to fight, public enemy, 1988",Americas,"['head.n.01', 'populace.n.01', 'artist.n.01', 'video.n.01', 'spectator.n.01', 'record.n.01', 'pair.n.01', 'search.n.01', 'scheme.n.01', 'conceptual.s.01', 'play.v.01', 'battle.n.01', 'screen.n.01']","['impersonation.n.03', 'hip-hop.n.01', 'art_history.n.01', 'video_recording.n.01', 'discordance.n.01', 'referential.s.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/tim_lee_untitled_party_for_your_right_to_fight_public_enemy.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/tim_lee_untitled_party_for_your_right_to_fight_public_enemy-300x237.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/party-for-your-right-to-fight-public-enemy-1988/,"['Cultural/18.17261290481105', 'Individual_Personal/5.670676691729323', 'Society/4.907070707070707']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Society']",28.75036030361108,"['Arts/9.988210722885645', 'History/3.3070707070707073', 'Technology/3.202614379084967']","['Arts', 'History', 'Technology']",16.49789580904132,"['Society/12.899692954104719', 'Cultural/8.902650290885585', 'Individual_Personal/7.547619047619047']","['Society', 'Cultural', 'Individual_Personal']",29.34996229260935,"['War/3.675', 'Spirituality/3.257142857142857', 'Mind/2.6']","['War', 'Spirituality', 'Mind']",9.532142857142857,1.0,0.0

Cultural history, as Lee emphasizes, is not stable and fixed; it is in a state of perpetual flux, “constantly shifting and changing, continually, repeatedly and endlessly.”","Vancouver-based artist Tim Lee employs a wide range of media, including photography, video, installation, and performance to revisit and reinterpret—often humorously—particular historical moments through a constellation of references.","Untitled (Alexander Rodchenko, 1928)",Americas,"['camera.n.01', 'history.n.01', 'scheme.n.01', 'ageless.s.01', 'background.n.01', 'formal.a.01', 'inspire.v.01', 'identity.n.01', 'model.n.01', 'cultural.a.01', 'title.n.01', 'series.n.01', 'image.n.01']","['pastiche.n.02', 'self-portrait.n.01', 'fluctuation.n.03', 'optics.n.02', 'reflection.n.05', 'art_history.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/tim_lee_-_untitled_alexander_rodchenko_1928_2008.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/tim_lee_-_untitled_alexander_rodchenko_1928_2008-300x260.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/untitled-alexander-rodchenko-1928/,"['Cultural/17.30693154454765', 'Individual_Personal/5.103258145363408', 'Society/1.6888888888888889']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Society']",24.099078578799947,"['Arts/10.053878568971449', 'Identity/1.794486215538847', 'History/1.6888888888888889']","['Arts', 'Identity', 'History']",13.537253673399183,"['Individual_Personal/13.074256462491759', 'Cultural/7.5013574660633475', 'Material_Physical/4.246906035141329']","['Individual_Personal', 'Cultural', 'Material_Physical']",24.822519963696436,"['Identity/5.797979797979798', 'Mind/5.595604395604395', 'Culture/3.3076923076923075']","['Identity', 'Mind', 'Culture']",14.7012765012765,0.6666666666666666,0.3333333333333333
Luisa Lambri,"Custom-built for a silent film star in 1934 in Santa Monica, the Sten-Frenke House is an idiosyncratic icon. Designed by the architect Richard Neutra, its gray glass, white expanses, and simple forms exude austerity. Luisa Lambri’s photograph Untitled (Sten-Frenke House #04) (2007)recalls the unembellished elegance of the structure while also alluding to modernist painting; the image is less a picture than an abstract expanse that conveys its own flatness. Whereas avant-garde paintings strove to suggest nothing but their own essence, Lambri inverts this aim, using the two-dimensionality of the photographic print to point elsewhere.","Rudolph Schindler’s designs, part of a practice he called “Space Architecture,” marry interior with exterior and space with light. The architect’s longtime studio and residence, which he built in Los Angeles in 1922, exemplifies this philosophy, and has since become an influential part of the modernist architectural canon. In Untitled (Schindler House #01) (2007), Luisa Lambri describes Schindler’s studio by capturing its aftereffects—the play of light and shadow cast through branches onto a surface.

Luisa Lambri,"Lambri’s careful framing in Untitled (Miller House, #02) redefines our understanding of this iconic mid-century modernist building located in Columbus, Indiana. Commissioned by industrialist J. Irwin Miller and his wife Xenia Simons Miller, and built by Eero Saarinen in 1953, the Miller house’s open and flowing layout expands upon modernist architectural traditions. It features a flat roof, stone and glass walls, with rooms configured beneath a grid pattern of skylights and supporting cruciform steel columns. Rather than a distanced view of the overall structure—favored by modernist architectural photographers like Julius Shulman—Lambri instead works from the inside, focusing on Saarinen’s windows and the soft, even light. The resulting image is a poetic abstraction, an architectural photograph that yields not only a picture of a building, but suggests what it actually feels like to be in that architectural space.","Rudolph Schindler’s designs, part of a practice he called “Space Architecture,” marry interior with exterior and space with light.

Mike Kelley,"Towhead n’Ganga, enclosed in darkness, lorded over by the sexualized folded high priestless form reflects many of Kelley’s works, in both its compositional and semantic qualities. The drawing on wood, the popcorn mixture, and the title all manifest a bumpy fullness, a “more-is-more” conflation between supposedly eternal spirituality and everyday stuff. The work’s title points to a serious timelessness completely belied by the materials. While the composition is attractive, the objects themselves efface a potentially straightforward meaning. This is underscored by the label left on the outer bucket, which keeps it tethered to everyday life and away from the free-floating and romantic mysticism associated with the installations of Joseph Beuys.","Mike Kelley’s sculptures, collages, performances, and videos often rework the artifacts of suburban culture into new forms: bodies, carpets, and less-distinct masses. Kelley laces the mess of erotics and death into the material stuff of the American imaginary, such as movies, country music, and stuffed animals.

Jordan Kantor,"Lens Flare and the series Untitled Basel Lens Flare (6168, 5950, 7497) were part of a solo project by the artist presented at ArtBasel in 2009. Included in the Kadist Collection, these works continue to explore the ontology of the image to investigate the relationship between painting, photography, and a new time-based variable: film. Reduced here to the essential function of recording the exposure of light through the apparatus of a lens, Kantor then translated these film stills into painted colored canvases that retain the 3:4 aspect ratio of the 16mm film as well as the exact size of the projected image. The resulting paintings depict the “lens flares” in the film—the fleeting reflective glare inside the camera apparatus that results from when its lens is pointed directly at a bright light source.","Jordan Kantor is considered to be an academic artist whose intellectual depth privileges the process of making art.

Rodney Graham,"Dance!!!!! continues Graham’s long-standing fascination with the myth of the American West, an idea he investigates through its prevalence in movies, music, and legends. Here, the artist recreates the familiar, hackneyed saloon scene from Hollywood Westerns in which a man—played by Graham himself—is forced to “dance” because bullets are being shot at his feet. Considered a “staged photograph,” Dance!!! reenacts and isolates a culturally repetitive “event.” In doing so, Graham is able to falsify personal experience thus questioning the “true” origin of every Western scene held in our collective cultural memory.","Conceptual artist Rodney Graham’s oeuvre is highly versatile and intellectual. By incorporating fictional narratives and alternative interpretations into an existing context, Graham creates visual puns that layer historical reference to examine social and philosophical systems. Not only is Graham the behind-the-scenes sculptor, photographer, filmmaker, inventor, scholar, writer and singer in his projects, he also literally appears in the finished works, impersonating various fictional characters.",Dance!!!,Americas,"['dance.n.01', 'scene.n.01', 'west.n.01', 'hollywood.n.01', 'keep.v.01', 'see.v.05', 'shoot.v.01', 'music.n.01', 'corporate.s.03', 'american.a.01', 'personal.a.01', 'event.n.01', 'beginning.n.04', 'memory.n.01', 'cultural.a.01', 'experience.n.01', 'idea.n.01', 'movie.n.01', 'photograph.n.01']","['western.a.02', 'parody.n.02', 'mythologization.n.01', 'stagy.s.01', 'mythology.n.01', 'american.a.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/rodney_graham_dance_2008.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/rodney_graham_dance_2008-300x229.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/dance/,"['Cultural/3.149317349317349', 'Politics/0.8', 'Individual_Personal/0.8']","['Cultural', 'Politics', 'Individual_Personal']",4.749317349317349,"['Arts/1.5800865800865802', 'Values/0.8', 'Technology/0.8']","['Arts', 'Values', 'Technology']",3.18008658008658,"['Cultural/34.6274707318825', 'Individual_Personal/19.02612942612943', 'Material_Physical/17.113883502118796']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Material_Physical']",70.76748366013072,"['Culture/10.631221719457017', 'Arts/9.736064425770309', 'Media/9.355982905982906']","['Culture', 'Arts', 'Media']",29.72326905121023,0.6666666666666666,0.3333333333333333
Tina Modotti,"Modotti’s Diego Rivera Mural: Billionaires Club; Ministry of Education, Mexico D.F., Third Gallery is a photograph of a section of a mural by Diego Rivera in the Ministry of Education in Mexico City. Rivera painted over a hundred frescoes throughout the courtyard of the building, an early mural series that helped revive and popularize the art of mural painting. Modotti, a friend of Rivera’s, took hundreds of photographs of the frescoes which depict divisions of labor in Mexican society. This particular photograph focuses on Rivera’s rendering of a dinner of the elite, feasting and reading a stock ticker.","Tina Modotti was an Italian film actress and photographer. As a photographer, she collaborated with Edward Weston and extensively documented the Mexican mural movement. In addition to her photography of Diego Rivera’s murals, she is also depicted in five of them. Modotti was involved in both the artistic and political avant-gardes of Mexico City, befriending members of and eventually joining the Mexican Communist party. Political repression forced her to move back to Europe, and she eventually lived in Moscow before moving to Spain when the Civil war began in 1936. In 1939, she returned to Mexico, where she died in 1942.","Diego Rivera Mural: Billionaires Club; Ministry of Education, Mexico D.F., Third Gallery",Americas,"['mexico.n.01', 'photograph.n.01', 'rendition.n.01', 'society.n.01', 'building.n.01', 'city.n.01', 'series.n.01']","['labor_movement.n.01', 'capitalism.n.01', 'fresco.n.01', 'industrialization.n.01', 'mural.n.01', 'marxism.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/tina_modotti_diego_rivera_mural_billionaries_club_ministry_of_education_1927.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/tina_modotti_diego_rivera_mural_billionaries_club_ministry_of_education_1927-230x300.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/diego-rivera-mural-billionaires-club-ministry-of-education-mexico-d-f-third-gallery/,"['Society/9.381979458450047', 'Cultural/6.0738218094255245', 'Material_Physical/4.347619047619048']","['Society', 'Cultural', 'Material_Physical']",19.80342031549462,"['Economy/7.701307189542483', 'Arts/6.0738218094255245', 'Politics/3.4117647058823524']","['Economy', 'Arts', 'Politics']",17.18689370485036,"['Cultural/9.499622926093515', 'Society/7.884823673058967', 'Material_Physical/6.613950411473631']","['Cultural', 'Society', 'Material_Physical']",23.998397010626114,"['Arts/6.9192307692307695', 'Land/5.844719642242862', 'Urbanization/5.258450046685341']","['Arts', 'Land', 'Urbanization']",18.022400458158973,1.0,0.3333333333333333
Piero Golia,"Golia’s Untitled 3 is an installation in which a mechanical device is programmed to shoot clay pigeons that are thrown up in front of a white wall. More than a simple reference to the sport, the work has the disconcerting effect of creating a danger zone in the gallery space. The reference to direct aggression or violence is reinforced by the piece’s rapid pace. But on another level, Untitled 3’s steady rhythm seems to constitute an alternate way of measuring time, an idea explored in other works in the Kadist Collection, like Mungo Thomson’s Untitled (TIME), Geoffrey Farmer’s Ongoing Time Stabbed with a Dagger, and William E. Jones’s Killed, in which the rapid succession of images also points towards the passing of time in the historical sense.","Italian-born and Los Angeles-based Piero Giolia’s work assumes the form of actions, sculptures, and installations often characterized as being extreme yet poetic. With a particular love for mischief, Golia takes everyday gestures and pushes them to the limit in order to cast an ironic look at contemporary society. Following the steps of legendary artists such as Bas Jan Ader, some of Golia’s works have taken the form of adventurous trips, like Going to Tirana (2000), in which he rowed across the Adriatic Sea, moving in the direction opposite from migrants trying to leave Albania.",Untitled #1 #2 #3,Europe,"['time.n.01', 'mention.n.01', 'rhythm.n.01', 'violence.n.01', 'shoot.v.01', 'research.v.02', 'degree.n.01', 'simple.a.01', 'historical.a.01', 'white.a.01', 'sense.n.01', 'idea.n.01', 'wall.n.01', 'piece.n.01', 'space.n.01', 'image.n.01']","['temporal.a.02', 'aggression.n.03', 'assembly.n.01', 'machine.n.01', 'passage.n.01', 'disorienting.a.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/piero_golia_untitled3.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/piero_golia_untitled3-199x300.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/untitled-1-2-3/,"['Cultural/12.817383107088991', 'Society/8.153333087621014', 'Material_Physical/4.374248120300752']","['Cultural', 'Society', 'Material_Physical']",25.34496431501076,"['Technology/9.670374560080441', 'Time/2.732142857142857', 'Violence/2.5702380952380954']","['Technology', 'Time', 'Violence']",14.972755512461394,"['Individual_Personal/18.167032967032974', 'Cultural/10.52893772893773', 'Material_Physical/8.84932844932845']","['Individual_Personal', 'Cultural', 'Material_Physical']",37.545299145299154,"['Mind/7.503296703296703', 'Values/5.92967032967033', 'Culture/5.5769230769230775']","['Mind', 'Values', 'Culture']",19.00989010989011,0.6666666666666666,0.0
Rachel Foster,"Rachel E. Foster uses printmaking, sculpture, and photography to illuminate the nearly invisible. For her source material she combs the digital world for bits of strange information that seep into our daily reality. These clues, be they coded sequences or simple phrases, become part of her puzzle; by reframing information she makes us reconsider it through a different lens. Language is embedded in Foster’s work, but it is subject to play, often becoming obscured or reoriented. In Ghost I (2009) the word “ghost” becomes ghosted, rendered ominously in white chalk on black paper so that it resembles an apparition. Average Lifespan (2009) calculates the average lifespan of eight famous poets. This seemingly random equation reveals to us the age at which the poets died and forges a posthumous relationship among them.","Rachel Foster is concerned with showing the unseen. Her prints and letterpress pieces humorously play with language, sight, and tactility. Ghost I and Ghost II work as a pair to conjure reflection and its “haunting” quality. Other prints, such as Dyslexia, deploy similar letters of the alphabet—b, d, q, p—to create a different kind of confusion and disorientation. In This is print, embossed Braille dots communicate: “This print is depicting another way a single idea can be communicated.” Through the use of very simple mechanisms, humor, and tautology, Foster pushes our understanding of the relationship between signs, senses, meanings, and readings.",Editioned Screenprints,Americas,"['ghost.n.01', 'phrase.n.01', 'digital.a.01', 'play.v.01', 'capable.s.02', 'age.n.01', 'strange.a.01', 'daily.s.01', 'sequence.n.01', 'language.n.01', 'celebrated.s.01', 'relationship.n.01', 'photography.n.01', 'simple.a.01', 'beginning.n.04', 'black.a.01', 'paper.n.01', 'white.a.01', 'world.n.03', 'sculpture.n.01', 'material.n.01']","['communication.n.01', 'code.v.02', 'imperceptible.a.01', 'language.n.01', 'information.n.02', 'invisible.a.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/rachel_foster_editioned_screenprints_the_collection.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/rachel_foster_editioned_screenprints_the_collection-240x300.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/editioned-screenprints/,"['Cultural/10.433943833943834', 'Politics/6.923076923076923', 'Individual_Personal/6.335042735042736']","['Cultural', 'Politics', 'Individual_Personal']",23.69206349206349,"['Language/4.488888888888889', 'Power/3.076923076923077', 'Mind/2.488888888888889']","['Language', 'Power', 'Mind']",10.054700854700855,"['Cultural/12.722820909740417', 'Individual_Personal/4.395604395604396', 'Material_Physical/4.391330891330892']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Material_Physical']",21.509756196675706,"['Arts/6.090342277261781', 'Culture/3.0854700854700856', 'Language/1.8888888888888888']","['Arts', 'Culture', 'Language']",11.064701251620756,0.6666666666666666,0.3333333333333333

Harrell Fletcher,"The American War, which takes its title from the Vietnamese term for what Americans call the Vietnam War, has toured the United States extensively with the goal of presenting a Vietnamese perspective of that history. The project began in 2005 when Fletcher visited the War Remnants Museum in Ho Chi Minh City. He was shocked by images that depicted the lasting effects of the war and the atrocities committed by the United States. Fletcher felt it important that these images be seen and discussed within an American context and, using a handheld digital camera, he photographed all of the museum’s images and labels. At that moment, Fletcher’s project resonated directly with the American intervention in Iraq and Afghanistan. The artist took extreme care in shooting the pictures from an angle that would diminish the flash reflection on the surfaces, and paid attention to capture the wall colors and the explanatory labels. In this sense, Fletcher’s re-creation of the Vietnamese installation not only shares important information but also recontextualizes it in a way that comments on the subjective and constructed nature of representation, both artistic and historic.","Harrell Fletcher’s socially-engaged, interdisciplinary projects reflect his keen critique of socio-political phenomena that involves the United States.",The American War,Americas,"['war.n.01', 'american.a.01', 'museum.n.01', 'undertaking.n.01', 'capture.v.01', 'angle.n.01', 'digital.a.01', 'american.n.01', 'intervention.n.01', 'effects.n.01', 'image.n.01', 'contemplation.n.02', 'colors.n.01', 'attention.n.01', 'surface.n.01', 'moment.n.01', 'representation.n.01', 'picture.n.01', 'nature.n.01', 'sense.n.01', 'context.n.01', 'position.n.03', 'wall.n.01', 'camera.n.01', 'city.n.01']","['war.n.01', 'recreate.v.04', 'position.n.03', 'photograph.n.01', 'reflection.n.02', 'vietnamese.a.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/harrell_fletcher_the_american_way_2005.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/harrell_fletcher_the_american_way_2005-300x235.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/the-american-war/,"['Society/6.048529411764706', 'Cultural/5.024622926093515', 'Politics/3.2']","['Society', 'Cultural', 'Politics']",14.273152337858221,"['Politics/3.2', 'War/2.75', 'Violence/1.6985294117647058']","['Politics', 'War', 'Violence']",7.648529411764706,"['Cultural/26.339843103233207', 'Individual_Personal/22.099150118886968', 'Society/19.332315233785824']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Society']",67.771308455906,"['Mind/10.003320802005014', 'Culture/8.946153846153848', 'Media/5.964102564102564']","['Mind', 'Culture', 'Media']",24.913577212261426,0.6666666666666666,0.0

Here, the imagined photographer captures a group of men gambling in a scene that appears to be illuminated by the photographer’s flash, an illusion that challenges the notion of the camera as the all-seeing and revealing.","Stan Douglas makes videos and photographs that draw on the legacy of modernism to explore the cultural, social, and political history of the twentieth century.

Pedro Reyes,"In Reyes’s words, “We should be able to extract the technological nutrients before we excrete our waste. There is a missing organ in our social metabolism which would work as a stomach or intestines. The Recyclone is a device made of plastic containers that fit into each other. (The plastic boxes are the equivalent to the ‘vellum,’ which are the tiny hairs that stick out from the intestinal wall to absorb nutrients). The permutation of this plastic bins could be customized to satisfy anyone’s recycling needs.” This work offers the possibility of a more visually appealing and adaptable recycling mechanism, assisting in the conscientious extraction of reusable material from industrial products.","Pedro Reyes’s works traverse the worlds of art, film, architecture, design, social criticism, and pedagogy. Educated as an architect, Reyes draws on this training to engage with utopian aspirations and the ongoing legacy of Modernism, often focusing on issues of scale and space while questioning pressing social issues through the incitement of individual or collective interaction. Although only a few of his works are directly located within the practice of building, almost all involve some kind of construction, whether they are objects, models, interiors, or social spaces. Reyes also makes use of strategies developed for communication or education, as well as everyday humor, to engage his audiences. Many of his works either allow large-scale public engagement or suggest a possible use: weapons turned to shovels, multilevel parks in old modernist buildings, and small spherical rooms. Like many avant-garde thinkers of the past, Reyes constructs new forms of architecture necessary for new ways of life.",Study for a Recycling Device,Unspecified,"['plastic.n.01', 'hair.n.01', 'industrial.a.01', 'box.n.01', 'possibility.n.01', 'wall.n.01', 'social.a.01', 'material.n.01']","['aesthetics.n.01', 'adaptability.n.01', 'recycling.n.01', 'garbage.n.03', 'arrangement.n.03', 'receptacle.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/pedro_reyes_study_for_a_recycling_device1.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/pedro_reyes_study_for_a_recycling_device1-300x179.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/study-for-a-recycling-device/,"['Cultural/12.243412452700381', 'Individual_Personal/4.247368421052632', 'Society/3.2040100250626566']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Society']",19.694790898815672,"['Arts/5.730994152046783', 'Technology/2.3790849673202614', 'Mind/1.7473684210526317']","['Arts', 'Technology', 'Mind']",9.857447540419678,"['Individual_Personal/4.0', 'Society/2.6', 'Cultural/1.6']","['Individual_Personal', 'Society', 'Cultural']",8.2,"['Mind/1.6', 'Spirituality/1.6', 'Community/1.0']","['Mind', 'Spirituality', 'Community']",4.2,1.0,0.3333333333333333

Alexandre da Cunha,"In Laissez-Faire (Rainbow Flag) da Cunha has turned a beach towel into both a painting and a flag.

Johanna Calle,"Calle’s drawings all inhabit received forms but alter them to call attention to specific qualities. A newspaper is both reproduced and modified to call attention to the newspaper as a means of information transmission. This also emphasizes the effect of various seemingly unimportant support mechanisms: the role of visual layout and images. In other drawings Calle explores systems: the unfurling of suburban streets, resembling text and the veins on a leaf. These congruences point to the unity of Calle’s thematic interests: the circulation of information, human energies, and lives.","Johanna Calle’s drawings use pre-existing systems to explore issues of built space, cultural identity, and language. Her work often departs from common lines of handwriting, altering them with energy and pattern.

Chris Johanson,"Apartment on Cardboard (2000) is an exterior view of an abstracted apartment building.

While their thoughts are specific, the painting captures a universal urban activity: looking across to the building next door and wondering about its residents, all the while knowing that they have probably looked over and wondered about us, as well.","The prolific Chris Johanson produces paintings, zines, installations, and sculptures that are notable for their earnest, almost childlike abstraction.

Julian Hoeber,"Every work in Hoeber’s 2011 series Execution Changes is titled in alphanumeric code. The geometric pattern that composes each acrylic-on-panel painting is determined by a preordained ratio of 2 to 3. But even though a formulaic system determines the image’s structure, its surface is full of painterly effects. While the minimalist appearance of these works references similarly striped paintings by Frank Stella, Hoeber does not emphasize the painting’s underlying structure but instead tugs it apart and obscures it. Layers of paint betray the image not as surface-and-support, but as presence with depth.","Using a variety of media, the Los Angeles–based artist Julian Hoeber produces fastidiously ordered compositions. His paintings, constructions, and installations emphasize concept and materiality even-handedly, resulting in works evocative of both intangible theory and concrete spatial relationships. His immersive environment Demon Hill (2010-2011) used gravity as its primary tool, while undermining everything certain about it; inside the space, the most predictable force on Earth operated at an unexpected and deeply disorienting angle. Uncommon sensation is a thread that runs through much of Hoeber’s work. The otherworldly springs from the readily available, unusually arranged. His paintings are situated somewhere between Modernism’s emphasis on the physical reality of the painting, Postmodernism’s fraying of that reality, and Op art’s insistence on playing perceptual tricks.",Execution Changes #22,Americas,"['structure.n.01', 'layer.n.01', 'form.n.03', 'effects.n.01', 'geometric.s.01', 'paint.n.01', 'appearance.n.01', 'surface.n.01', 'presence.n.01', 'mention.n.01', 'image.n.01', 'series.n.01']","['dimensionality.n.01', 'painterly.s.01', 'formulaic.s.01', 'materiality.n.02', 'stella.n.01', 'minimalism.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/julian_hoeber_execution_changes.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/julian_hoeber_execution_changes-200x300.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/execution-changes-22/,"['Material_Physical/2.709090909090909', 'Individual_Personal/1.6', 'Cultural/0.8333333333333334']","['Material_Physical', 'Individual_Personal', 'Cultural']",5.142424242424242,"['Materiality/1.9090909090909092', 'Design/0.8333333333333334', 'Identity/0.8']","['Materiality', 'Design', 'Identity']",3.542424242424243,"['Cultural/26.96813186813187', 'Society/12.80769230769231', 'Material_Physical/10.306593406593407']","['Cultural', 'Society', 'Material_Physical']",50.08241758241759,"['Arts/9.629670329670331', 'Design/7.923076923076923', 'Economy/7.115384615384617']","['Arts', 'Design', 'Economy']",24.66813186813187,0.6666666666666666,0.3333333333333333

Tres cadencias in English is “three cadences.” This 2005 work is an installation comprised of three strings of small felt flags that can be hung in variable configurations. Whereas these kinds of flags often represent professional or amateur sports affiliations, here Cruzvillegas turns such signs of team loyalty into a visual metaphor for a linguistic or musical structure by combining two simple, common objects. As the banners sag from the chords they create a visual harmony that represents falling inflections, musical chords, and individual notes that comprise a piece of music or a spoken phrase.","Abraham Cruzvillegas is known for his intricate and elaborate sculptures and installations made from found and scavenged materials. He often fashions useful objects out of repurposed parts and urban detritus. Cruzvillegas is inspired by the resourcefulness he has witnessed in impoverished rural and urban areas, where people build houses and necessary objects out of recycled materials such as cars and bottles.",Tres cadencias,Unspecified,"['flag.n.01', 'note.n.01', 'common.a.01', 'ocular.a.02', 'phrase.n.01', 'kind.n.01', 'address.n.03', 'metaphor.n.01', 'music.n.01', 'function.n.01', 'construction.n.01', 'sign.n.01', 'individual.a.01', 'simple.a.01', 'structure.n.01', 'object.n.01', 'piece.n.01']","['chord.v.01', 'reclaim.v.02', 'flag.n.01', 'linguistic.a.01', 'felt.n.01', 'harmony.n.05']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Tres_cadencias.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Tres_cadencias-300x200.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/tres-cadencias/,"['Cultural/1.7980769230769231', 'Society/0.7692307692307693', 'Material_Physical/0.7692307692307693']","['Cultural', 'Society', 'Material_Physical']",3.3365384615384617,"['Arts/0.9230769230769231', 'Design/0.875', 'Economy/0.7692307692307693']","['Arts', 'Design', 'Economy']",2.5673076923076925,"['Cultural/21.306856318775832', 'Society/5.051282051282051', 'Individual_Personal/4.049903038138332']","['Cultural', 'Society', 'Individual_Personal']",30.408041408196215,"['Arts/9.820721108956404', 'Design/5.764981363665574', 'Language/2.644230769230769']","['Arts', 'Design', 'Language']",18.22993324185275,0.6666666666666666,0.6666666666666666
James Welling,"Welling employs simple materials like crumpled aluminum foil, wrinkled fabric and pastry dough and directly exposes them as photograms, playing with the image in the process of revealing it. Although Welling’s approach to photography is more conceptually oriented than poetic, the resulting image in Stowe (a direct photogram of a crumpled piece of cloth) somehow resembles a curtain, perhaps suggesting that an artificial even fictive component in photographic representation.

James Welling,"#17 Pink is a photogram, a photographic image produced without the use of a camera. Here, the artist placed plumbago blossoms on a sheet of eight-by-ten-inch film and exposed it to light. The negative was then projected onto Kodak Metallic Endura paper through a color mural enlarger and cooler filters to produce the multicolored print.

Ian Wallace,"Wallace says of his Heroes in the Street series, “The street is the site, metaphorically as well as in actuality, of all the forces of society and economics imploded upon the individual, who, moving within the dense forest of symbols of the modern city, can achieve the status of the heroic.” The hero in Study for my Heroes in the Street (Stan) is the photoconceptual artist Stan Douglas, who is depicted here (and also included in the Kadist Collection) as an archetypal figure restlessly drifting the streets of the modern world. Patches of canvas cover parts of this otherwise representational photograph and ask the viewer to consider the role that editing and play in our perception of the urban landscape and modernity.","British-born and Vancouver-based, Ian Wallace is known for his conceptual art practice and critical writings.

Conrad Ruiz,"It may take a minute to recognize the background of New Fall Lineup – the colors are tweaked into a world of cartoon and candy, and it is covered by leaping energetic figures and flying squirrels. One realizes, though, that the image is of the World Trade Center exploding into flame, creating a strange contrast with the painting’s colors and the other images. The combination is peculiar because the role the explosion serves here is non-specific. The image loses its totemic weight, as it seems to not matter what particular explosion this is. The picture exists in a strange cultural subconscious of flight, candy, blockbuster movies, and the news, tied together by delicate tight painting.","Conrad Ruiz makes watercolor paintings of fantastic scenes. Bursts of color and energy sit behind flying figures and animals. Images become painted patterns, as rows of repeated objects and buildings’ striations verge on geometric abstraction. Ruiz’ identifies his work with the “ultimate boy zone”, and the connection is clear. His paintings are populated by explosions, giant sharks, and athletes.

Alain Séchas,"“To me, art equals responsibility”.  That is probably why Alain Séchas creates works according to the human scale, immediately evoking the human body. But rather than using the human figure, he chose that of the cat: a round-eyed feline which never smiles. ” Doing cats becomes like a trap, so that we identify a lot with it (…) and all the imagery of the cat reappears: the Egyptian cat, comics, caricature etc”.  Chosen as our anthropological equivalent, the cat plays various characters, often provocative, and becomes the intermediary between the artist and the viewer. More than a mere sculpture, he is a drawing with volume, a motif which endlessly changes: ” I have always said that my work was about drawing; a small drawing is as important as a large sculpture and its making is as difficult for me. » Falsely naive, the work of Alain Séchas stands out and opens our eyes, like his cat: « Forcing the viewer to see is to me the very definition of art », he says. With no complacency whatsoever.  Peace and Love shows a family with children who embody some of the typical calamities of society written on their T-shirt: “murder”, “suicide”, “gore” thus criticising the values of the generation of May 1968.","Alain Séchas was born in 1955 in Colombes, France.

Roman Ondak,"This work needs to be considered in relation to one of his performances during which people were made to queue in front of the Kunsthalle of Frankfurt in 2003 (Tate Collection). In this instance Ondak collected images of people queuing in front of all sorts of buildings in various newspapers. He then inserted these in a Slovakian newspaper without trying to give any coherence with the information in the text on the same page. The result is a fictional space with the potential for the invention of different scenarios. The theme of people queuing encourages the consideration of the relation between interior and exterior but also of exclusion. It can also be a reference to deprivation during periods of war or economic depression. In the manner of works by Felix Gonzales-Torres, the audience can take a copy of the newspaper which therefore leaves the exhibition space. The fact that the message or the artwork circulates is an integral part of the artistic gesture. People lining up behind one another also formally becomes a living sculpture. The refusal to allow the object to be recouped by the flux of liberal economy echoes the refusal of any monumentality which was used so often by authoritarian regimes.","In 2009, Roman Ondák won the Golden Lion at the Venice Biennale for Loop, the Pavilion of the Czech and Slovak Republics, for which he brought the same plant-life and trees growing outside inside. This highly considered installation epitomizes Ondák’s work. With often discreet, tongue-in-cheek, conceptual, participatory modes, he succeeds in profoundly questioning the art world and its established quirks, exhibition spaces, behaviors like queuing, labeling or various pedagogical approaches, visitor experience, any misplaced preciousness about authenticity or authorship. Various tactics (asking friends for drawings) or forms (shoelaces for instance) recur in his photographs, performances, installations, videos.

Roman Ondak,"As the caption purposely admits, these drawings were made by friends of Ondák’s at home in Slovakia asked to interpret places he has journeyed to. The description of the blond artist wearing the same outfit and bag in places of transit like airports, stations or streets are faithful in straightforward (verging on naïve) styles. His own skill as artist is displaced and delegated to others with no particular gift in draftsmanship. Taking the role of a commissioner recurs regularly in Ondák’s work, other examples include Common Trip (2000) constituted with 128 elements, I’m Just Acting in It (2007) with 24 drawings, for instance.  These eight drawings were placed in variegated simple home decoration frames to create a sort of storyboard for the artist’s life. For political, personal or economic reasons, not everyone has similar possibilities for mobility. Ondák’s act of sharing his memories expands the potential impact of art for a different public, made actors on these occasions. The interpretations give different viewpoints but maintain a certain continuity, as if it is the artist’s travelogue once removed. The repetitive descriptions of a walking man have interesting parallels with Francis Alys’s two-dimensional work.","In 2009, Roman Ondák won the Golden Lion at the Venice Biennale for Loop, the Pavilion of the Czech and Slovak Republics, for which he brought the same plant-life and trees growing outside inside. This highly considered installation epitomizes Ondák’s work. With often discreet, tongue-in-cheek, conceptual, participatory modes, he succeeds in profoundly questioning the art world and its established quirks, exhibition spaces, behaviors like queuing, labeling or various pedagogical approaches, visitor experience, any misplaced preciousness about authenticity or authorship. Various tactics (asking friends for drawings) or forms (shoelaces for instance) recur in his photographs, performances, installations, videos.

Roman Ondak,"“A man wanders near the windows of a gallery, situated adjacent to the street. He occasionally gazes through windows into the gallery but never enters.” Passersby are numerous since these windows are by a tram stop on a busy street. It is surprising to note how few of them take any notice of this man peering repeatedly through the slightly tinted glass into an empty meeting room with no distinctive signs to be seen. It turns out this was a performance at the Kunsthaus in Graz. A annunciating drawing with the same title was shown in Ondák’s solo show More Silent Than Even at gb agency in Paris the same year; this show also included an invisible eavesdropping device. The uncomfortable connotations of surveillance, whether visual or aural, in everyday situations or art galleries, were in focus.  The camera shots following this strange act of insistent staring and squinting vary from different perspectives outdoors or from inside the space looking at him, with consequent shifts in soundscapes.  In The Stray Man‘s exercise in curiosity, nothing happens. This action in the public sphere could appear useless. But this extended, seemingly trivial, gesture is a contemporary poetic take of the act of looking, on its meaning today, its possibilities and difficulties applicable to the art world as much as to human and socio-political permissiveness or constraints at large.","In 2009, Roman Ondák won the Golden Lion at the Venice Biennale for Loop, the Pavilion of the Czech and Slovak Republics, for which he brought the same plant-life and trees growing outside inside.

Anthony McCall,"The film Line Describing a Cone was made in 1973 and it was projected for the first time at Fylkingen (Stockholm) on 30 August of the same year. This piece, which was initially screened in independent film contexts, it soon began to be shown at art museums and ended up becoming one of the key works of the artistic movement that opened up the visual arts towards cinema. With a duration of 30 minutes, the film shows the creation of a white curve being projected onto an empty space. A thin mist is introduced into the projection area, therefore the viewer can progressively see (more than a circle reflected on the wall) a large cone of light which simultaneously becomes a light sculpture into which he is invited to circulate. By allowing the viewer to immerse himself in it, and play with this strange substance, Line Describing a Cone becomes not only something made to be seen, but also something to be experienced since the viewer is absorbed into the scene and becomes part of the action. In this way, McCall recreates an inversion: by placing the public facing the projector, he reveals the entire process of kinematics and, at the same time, he destroys any possibility of illusionism, in order to create another, that of magic, poetry and wonder.","Since the 70s, the British artist Anthony McCall has continued to push the boundaries of art. Exploring the boundaries between cinema and sculpture, he uses light and time as his signature materials. His work spans across drawing, installation, and performance, one of his preferred mediums.  McCall is a key figure of British avant-garde film from the 70s. His first films retrace his outdoor performances. Experimental film in 16mm is one of his main mediums that he uses in confrontation with sculpture and performance.

Anthony McCall,"This score is a graphic record of the detailed choreography of one of Anthony McCall’s Landscape for Fire performances. These took place between 1972-74 in the UK at the Museum of Modern Art in Oxford, Colchester School of Art, in Reading and in North Weald as well as in Sweden at Fylkingen Society of Contemporary Music and Arts, Stockholm, and in the USA at the William Patterson University, Wayne, New Jersey. Many of these events were photographed by David Kilburn and Carolee Schneemann, only one in 1972 was filmed. Dressed entirely in white, the artist and his collaborators lit braziers outdoors at nightfall, to the sound of foghorns. According to printed documentation, Subcycle 10 lasted 144 minutes between 4.42pm-7.06pm.  If one refers to another drawing dated March 1973 in the Getty Research Institute, the numbering from 0-148 are the minutes and the columns with the numbers “12, 8, 4” indicate  the time sequence. The geometric precision of these diagrams documents McCall’s specifically imagined spatial plan of interaction with unpredictable elements of fire, air and environmental conditions to create a near ritualistic event harking back to age-old traditions. The grid system formalizes the pacing or staging of this earthwork. McCall had begun his body of works drawing with light with the ‘Fire Event’ series of performances in his studio in London in 1971.","Since the 70s, the British artist Anthony McCall has continued to push the boundaries of art.

Akram Zaatari,"“In the 1980s I started using coloured paper backdrops, one of which was yellow. You can see they never reached the floor. I used them for colour and black-and-white photography.” Hashem El Madani.  Hashem El Madani, a studio photographer in Saida, began working in 1948. Like all studio photographers his subjects came to him. The studio was a constant flux of visitors. It was perceived as a safe haven, where the subjects of his photographs could act out their fantasies within the conventional format of portrait photography.  Madani records the poses, clothes and behaviour of his clients reflecting the social and political context in which they lived as well as the norms and the taboos. He portrays anonymous personages, people who normally fall below the radar of public interest.","Zaatari combines the skills of a historian, a curator and an artist. He is interested in salvaging and preserving the past, in challenging the perceived norms of history. ‘Diversity is the most important factor in resisting misrepresentation’ he stated. ‘Focusing on iniduality thus becomes a political mission.’  Akram Zaatari was born in 1966 in Saida, Lebanon.

Pavel Wolberg,"A young settler girl, dressed in a bridal outfit for Purim, stands in a street in Hebron waiting, perhaps for her parents or other children to join her. In the background three soldiers scan the buildings and the rooftops for threatening presences. Turning her back to the soldiers, the little girl pays no attention to what surrounds her. Her gaze is directed beyond the picture’s frame. The soldiers do not seem to protect the child either, their eyes and guns are pointed in different directions. Two of them seem to be looking at the camera, which brings the picture back to a certain reality. In this photograph, as in the one with the disguised boy, there is a palpable tension and the contradictory representation of two realties: the war and childhood innocence. Moreover, in both photographs, the costume implies fiction and may suggest that feelings are hidden. Wolberg’s images portray violence, but very differently than what you expect from war reportage, for example the terrible images of children during the Vietnam war like the famous photograph by Kim Phuc. Pavel Wolberg observes the incongruities of life in Israel, where trying to carry on a « normal » life can sometime create absurd situations.","Pavel Wolberg studied photography at the Camera Obscura School of Art in Tel Aviv. Since graduating he has pursued two careers simultaneously: that of a field photographer for newspapers and as an artist. This duality is reflected in his work, but it is also at the heart of much of the most interesting photography being made now. Like artists such as Wolfgang Tillmans, Wolberg blurs the boundaries between fine art photography, reportage and fashion photography. Living in a theatre of conflict, Pavel Wolberg records the tensions, absurdities and insecurities of daily life in both Israel and the Occupied territories. His work (re)presents the complex times in which we live and, although rooted in the Israeli situation, his images represent incongruities the world over.Pavel Wolberg was born in Leningrad in 1966 and he immigrated to Israel in 1973.

Kelley Walker,"The triptych Black Star Press is part of the series ‘The Black Star Press project’ initiated in 2004 by the American artist Kelley Walker. The images in this series are taken from a photo essay on the struggle for civil rights in Alabama, directed by Charles Moore in 1962 (and published by the magazine ‘Life’) which showed the repression of the black population and persistent inequalities in the southern United States. The title “Black Star Press” is taken from the name of the news agency where Charles Moore worked, and it refers to the young black man shot fighting for the rights of his community. Of those recovered images, scanned and screen printed, Walker poured dark chocolate, white and milk chocolate in the manner of a dripping. This symbolic gesture breaks down the documentary nature of the image and expresses heightened subjectivity of Abstract Expressionism, which opposes the action a cold mechanical representation of the image. Reactivating the potential opened up by Andy Warhol’s artistic offerings in the series ‘Race Riot’, “Black Star Press” echoes the entire tradition of image appropriation, from Pop Art and Appropriationism itself.","While the pop art movement and the appropriationist movement essentially concerned the iconography of popular media, like newspapers to TV commercials, Kelley Walker is interested in the media system as a whole. Her work frequently questions the notions of author and audience, originality and authenticity, reproduction and the circulation of images. The artist plays with the usual distribution system of the work of art.  The image contained therein can indeed be reproduced endlessly and printed in various formats according to wishes of the buyer, as exemplified in the work Shema (2003). Demonstrating that there is more ways than one to escape the rehearsal process, Untitled (2003) is a steel plate of the recycling logo superimposed over an image. For Walker, it is no longer necessary to appropriate ideas, objects, images but to recycle them: the perpetual recycling of codes and systems inherent in advertising.

Colectivo Tercerunquinto,"BF15 is a preparatory study for the collective’s intervention at the BF15 gallery in Mexico, near Monterrey. It includes a photograph, a collage, sketches and notes. The intervention consists in the seamless extension of the wall of the BF15 gallery beyond the property boundaries, invading the sidewalk and the street, entering public space. The artists highlight the permeability between public, professional and private space. Through these actions, they question the definition of those notions, and become involved in negotiations, making connections and exchanges. Interrogating the role of each space and its function is central to their work.","Tercerunquinto develops work related to the urban, the boundaries between public and private space. By introducing simple signs or gestures – the construction of a concrete slab, displacement of a portion of bitumen on the side of the road, encroachement of grass on a parking, the three artists interrogate public space as the place of possibilities. Their interventions give users an active status with the power to decide on their own environment. For the Hong Kong architecture biennale, the collective intervened in the exhibition spaces. The intervention consisted in constructing a wall which integrated the word ‘Anarchitecture’ (anarchy + architecture) by omitting certain bricks. Therefore it was as if the word had perforated the wall. Through the wall, the spectator could see the city and its transformations. Thus the spectator was invited to develop his critical outlook on the environment.The collective – formed in 1998 – is composed by Julio Castro, born in 1976, Gabriel Cazares, born in 1978, and Rolando Flores, born in 1975.

Christiane Baumgartner,"Baumgartner’s own excursion into war imagery is the diptych Formation. She was watching a television documentary on the Second World War, was struck by the extraordinary nature of the colour film and decided to video it. The two frames she isolated depict the shadows the planes cast on the ground and the sun glinting off their steel fuselages. Of course the next few frames showed the destruction they wrought as they strafed a target in Germany but Baumgartner was not interested in that aspect. It was the beauty of the images she found compelling: the tones, the shapes and the speed.  Images from World War Two, when seen from the distance of years and the safety of the home, have become mythical. They depict stories handed down with which a younger generation feels little personal connection. They no longer have the power to shock and have entered the realm of the aesthetic. […] The images we see through the refractive television screen are aestheticised and their meaning is somewhat neutralised. [The artist] disarms them even further by means of Photoshop and, then, by translating the image into woodcut. The final image is far removed from feeling, from experiencing the destructive capacity of the war machines. »  Excerpt from Jeremy Lewison, « At the Still Point of the Turning World », in Christiane Baumgartner, edited by Johan Deumens, 2007, p. 43","Christiane Baumgartner’s practice is related to her origins. Born in Germany’s historic capital of book publishing, she trained as a printmaker and has also made books. Woodcut is her preferred medium.In her works she travels backwards in the history of image technologies, first by making videos or photographs that she transfers herself onto large-framed boards, then by carving and printing them. The topics depicted are often transport infrastructures (roads, tunnels, airports…) which evoke traveling, circulation in space, and also play a major role in armed conflicts; these urban landscapes in which concrete predominates, evince the alienation of the modern environment, the boredom of long journeys and embody the fanaticism for speed accompanying the development of transport in the contemporary era. Her motifs contrast with her use of a primitive handicraft. The slowness of this technique makes an ironic contrast with her subjects.Christiane Baumgartner’s artistic approach thereby weaves a complex relationship to time, combining a return toward the past, a contemporary fascination for speed, and the deliberate choice of a painstaking technique.Christiane Baumgartner was born in Leipzig, Germany, in 1967.

Michel Auder,"The Town consists of footage taken from Auder’s studio of the skyline of New York, tracking planes as they fly across the sky and pass tall buildings. At the time of recording, like all of this films, there was no particular intent. However, in the aftermath of 9/11, this film becomes prescient and ominously prophetic. Planes fly by and through buildings, including the World Trade Centre and while the film begins with a soundtrack, the final footage of fog swirling around the WTC is silent. Although never made as a memorial to the destruction of the WTC this film cannot help but become one. It is the most extraordinary piece of serendipity and a tribute to Auder’s methods of filming random moments that retrospectively acquire meaning.","Michel Auder was born in 1945 in Soissons, France.

Michel Auder,"Talking Head is a short film in black and white of Auder’s daughter Alexandra, hidden behind a hemp plant, playing with a plastic wrapper and babbling in an imaginative way. The viewer is uncertain whether Alexandra knows she is being filmed but given that Auder was constantly filming she was probably oblivious to it. Her statements make little sense to the outsider : ‘The thing never came back again. It wasn’t the same thing. That thing. Was nice.’ But to her it seems to represent some imaginative narrative connected to the peeling back of the plastic wrapper. The viewer of the film feels as though he has been admitted to her innermost mind, the unconscious. The informal documentary nature of Auder’s films has had wide repercussions in terms of contemporary film making. This kind of low-tech practice informs the work of such artists as Steve McQueen and Gillian Wearing and ran parallel to the fly on the wall practices of documentary filmmakers in the 1970s such as Ken Loach. The acquisition of works by Auder provides a reference point for a number of works in the Kadist collection (Laumann, McAlpine, Menick etc).","Michel Auder was born in 1945 in Soissons, France.

Yto Barrada,"In this photographic series, Yto Barrada was interested in the logos of the buses that travel between North Africa and Europe. They become like abstract paintings that recall Modernist formal experimentation. They are somehow symptomatic of the circulation of goods and people that is made to sound so abstract. The commentaries of two Moroccan children that accompany the images reminds us about the fact that everyday candidates to emigration try to spot these buses that will cross the Strait. Many children hide there and undertake long illicit journeys. As is often the case in her photographs, Yto Barrada chose a square format that conveys immobility despite the reference to transport. They are flat, without perspective, like the numerous walls visible in her work. The loss of depth in things ensures that any pain consciously stays separate from the beauty of the images.","Yto Barrada is an artist of Morrocan origin who has worked for many years in Tangier, a urbanized border town influenced by the West. Her work is articulated around Tangier’s territory and raises questions on the city’s rapid infrastructural changes associated with economical development and real-estate speculation.  Tangier, in a sense, is at the point of becoming a Moroccan Costa del Sol. “Le project du détroit,” a work that has granted her international visibility, consists of videos and series of photographs, in attempt to describe a city of transit and in transition. For a considerable amount of time, Tangier was the gate to Europe that Schengen closed in 1991. A meeting point between Europe and Africa, the strait of Gibraltar became a “larger Morrocan cemetary” that refugees and asylum seekers used to cross from Tangier. Her work reminds one of documentary reporting, yet with a poetic vision, far from exoticism and spectacle. In her work, the city’s inhabitants, or their traces, find themselves at the heart of her images.   Yto Barrada was born in Tangier in 1971.

Jochen Lempert,"A Trip to the North Sea is composed of 6 parts. The images show a rough sea, with huge waves. The waves foam, swell and collapse. The large size of the images, like posters, engulf the spectator’s body, as if captured by the wave which becomes sonorous in its surge, rolling from one image to the other. The clear horizon traces a line, a continuity between each image. The waves are rendered like an all over. Their massiveness accentuates the sculptural aspect of the subject. In the printing process, the artist has recomposed the image, aligning the horizon so all aspects coincide. The process remains simple and contributes to the construction of a mental and archetypal image. The vision Lempert proposes is that of an intact and virgin world. All his work has an ephemeral, ungraspable, touching feel.","Trained as a biologist, Lempert’s subjects are nature and its inhabitants while also being very influenced by the art of his time: seriality, archiving, abstraction, all-over painting. His approach to reality is empirical. At all times one is aware of his wonder and profound amazement with the world. He records traces, the natural geometries of the world, and thus defines his place between photography, drawing, abstraction and the object. His work in subtle. This is not to do with the definition of his images, but on the contrary with their absence of clarity, the choice made between the reality of the shot and the work in the lab. A double process occurs: what is captured and becoming in the presumed images is modified by the printing. There is some sort of loss, an incomplete image. The materiality of the paper plays a role in this approximate definition introducing a poor patina, entertaining the attitude of unlearning and starting again. Therefore the question can be posed differently: making visible something that is escaping, decomposing and going elsewhere.Jochen Lempert was born in Moers, Germany, in 1958. he lives and works in Hamburg.",Un voyage en Mer du Nord ( A trip to the North Sea),Europe,"['wave.n.01', 'horizon.n.01', 'sea.n.01', 'aspect.n.01', 'image.n.01', 'procedure.n.01', 'trip.n.01', 'size.n.01', 'render.v.01', 'capture.v.01', 'poster.n.01', 'huge.s.01', 'ephemeral.s.01', 'vision.n.01', 'sculptural.a.01', 'construction.n.01', 'compose.v.01', 'simple.a.01', 'body.n.01', 'subject.n.01', 'spectator.n.01']","['horizon.n.01', 'pure.s.04', 'wave.n.01', 'archetypal.s.01', 'ephemeral.s.01', 'continuity.n.03']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/img-683.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/img-683-300x219.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/un-voyage-en-mer-du-nord-a-trip-to-the-north-sea/,['Material_Physical/4.292307692307692'],['Material_Physical'],4.292307692307692,"['Time/2.3692307692307697', 'Immaterial/1.0', 'Physics/0.9230769230769231']","['Time', 'Immaterial', 'Physics']",4.292307692307693,"['Cultural/15.995934784170084', 'Material_Physical/14.668986568986574', 'Individual_Personal/10.833699633699636']","['Cultural', 'Material_Physical', 'Individual_Personal']",41.498620986856295,"['Space/6.346153846153846', 'Arts/5.534640522875817', 'Time/4.004151404151404']","['Space', 'Arts', 'Time']",15.884945773181066,0.5,0.3333333333333333
Bruno Serralongue,"The half-length portrait of Joe Shirley presents a man with a great presence, wearing several items that point to ancestral Native American culture. In this photograph, which is relatively poor in information, the projection screen in the background acts as a clue about the event: Bruno Serralongue went to the second phase of the ‘Sommet Mondial sur la Société de l’Information’ (or SMSI, World Summit on Information Society, in Tunis in November 2005). This portrait echoes another picture in the same series (Native Peoples Claim Their Right to Participate in the Information Society) in which Joe Shirley is just a silhouette amongst the speakers, whereas here he occupies the entire frame. The strange impression that the model is posing for press photographers – and not for an artist making a portrait – reveals the staging of the event along the lines of the ‘discourse of order’ (Michel Foucault). In addition, the painting format introduces a different reading to that of a press photo. The artist questions the point of view and the space: “What distance should be adopted to face an event ? […] In my view, when using a different tool like a photographic chamber, there is necessarily a greater distance. […] In documentary photography, there is this idea of adjusting the distance, so that one cannot see too much or too little. One needs to find a distance within which the photographed person or event can ‘speak’”.","Bruno Serralongue integrates his practice into the processes of production and distribution of information via images. He attends very diverse events such as regional festivities (Les fêtes, 1994), the universal exhibition in Hanover (Expo 2000), a neoliberal meeting in Chiapas (Encuentro, Chiapas, 1996), with a rhythm which is different to that of a press photo-journalist. With no specific accreditation and by using a camera that requires very long exposures, his standpoint is of course different. The artist questions commissions and working methods – he then integrates these as modalities for producing  images by instatinga distance between the subject and the personal stylistic signature. According to his protocol for the Faits divers series (1993- 1995), the photographer works on very allusive information extracted from t miscellaneous news item section of the ‘Nice-Matin’ newspaper; Serralongue goes to the place mentioned two days after the event. As if emptied, the images create a space for representation that did not exist before. In the context of a crisis of representation and the scripting of reality by press images, “the document is a response to the world of images on the actual territory of the images, it is perhaps the only way to oppose the monopoly of spectacle”, according to Michel Poivert (in his analysis of the documentary style in “La photographie contemporaine”,  2002), “the photographer and the spectator are reconciled by the adoption of the ordinary man’s viewpoint”.","Mr Joe Shrigley Jr, président de la nation Navajo",Europe,"['distance.n.01', 'event.n.01', 'portrayal.n.01', 'imperativeness.n.01', 'society.n.01', 'position.n.03', 'reading.n.01', 'documentary.a.01', 'entire.s.01', 'phase.n.01', 'format.n.01', 'strange.a.01', 'line.n.01', 'tool.n.01', 'photograph.n.01', 'background.n.01', 'screen.n.01', 'projection.n.01', 'american.a.01', 'person.n.01', 'photography.n.01', 'photographer.n.01', 'model.n.01', 'picture.n.01', 'presence.n.01']","['navaho.n.01', 'portraiture.n.02', 'stagy.s.01', 'pose.n.02', 'frame.v.02', 'conference.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/img-365.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/img-365-232x300.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/mr-joe-shrigley-jr-president-de-la-nation-navajo/,"['Cultural/1.6421052631578947', 'Society/0.7692307692307693']","['Cultural', 'Society']",2.411336032388664,"['Arts/1.6421052631578947', 'Community/0.7692307692307693']","['Arts', 'Community']",2.411336032388664,"['Cultural/15.196614273239662', 'Individual_Personal/13.059879336349928', 'Society/11.399145299145301']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Society']",39.65563890873489,"['Arts/6.8665991902834005', 'Politics/4.0', 'Materiality/3.5256410256410255']","['Arts', 'Politics', 'Materiality']",14.392240215924426,0.8,0.4
Peter Friedl,"Map 1969-2005, a poster glued on the wall, questions space in its relation to geography. On a red background, a free-hand drawing in white refers to the aesthetics of maps. Map 1969-2005 is not an accurate map of the United States, but one that combines mapping, overlaps and merges diverse elements: Oregon, Lake Superior, San Francisco, Cheyenne, Missouri, Zuni, Navajo, Texas, Shawee, Colorado, Piegan, Canada, Miami, etc. In the same space the map’s original design and representation is also shown, yet each requires a specific reading, and each reading is different. Map 1969-2005 is a critical image which by introducing geographical and identity shifts plays out exploration myths of the United States territory.","Many of the projects of Peter Friedl, in their heterogeneous medium and style, function as intersection points between countless lines of thought and reference, creating a vast didactic network where dialogues simultaneously merge with critical logic and narrative.

Peter Friedl,"Peter Friedl’s projects place aesthetic questions within an expanded field that takes into account the social, political and philosophical context. This textile piece quotes and diverts a flag with a red background and the central star of the Kurdistan National Liberation Front (ERNK, a military organization linked to PKK, founded in 1985 and disbanded in 2000), and not the national flag of Kurdistan. The artist became interested as from 1994, when the town of Lice was destroyed by the Turkish army and the PKK was expelled from Germany. This flag got a lot of visibility in the media at the time.  The artist has lightened the red and emptied the central circle to question the role of the emblem as a representative sign for a group. Lightening and cutting out are ways of reclaiming all the complexities. New Kurdish Flag 01 considers the status of the flag as an object of propaganda which was activated in the streets during different performances, before being ‘museified’ and placed in a frame in 2005, in a semantic slip.

Guillaume Leblon,"Puits (“Wells”) is a circle made ??of raw earth elements, at the scale of Leblon’s hands. In this work, Guillaume Leblon reclaims the tactility of clay, as a classical material of sculpture, which we can also see in his other works like Raum (2006), National Monument (2006), and Notes (2007). Puits (“Wells”) suggests a universe of the past, like the 700 wells of Mohenjo-daro, the thriving Indus city from the second millennium BC (Pakistan, cf. Link). In the case of Guillaume Leblon, this form is a reminiscencence, as developed by Aby Warburg, whose forms survive and reappear through the ages and places. This work points toward the idea of wells, mimicking their shapes, while questioning their use. This well is not functional and resists to water. Its hole is replaced by a space enclosed with brick. Maybe the well is a metaphor of the opening artist’s studio to the world? The artist introduces a sense of fragility between unstable equilibrium and the threat of collapse.","Guillaume Leblon is a sculptor, who questions the vocabulary of forms – he uses material encompassing  copper alloy of tin and zinc, flows like water, lightning, smoke, and space to express notions of landscape and weightlessness. During an exhibition at Sonsbeek in the Netherlands, Leblon proposed the work “Temps libre” (Free Time) (2001), a jump from three floors of the tallest building in Arnhem. His works function as indices, in form, references or emotions, creating a very special atmosphere which reflects his interest in modernism that he defines as “a total art that includes a real time.” In Leblon’s work, perception of space by the viewer is often precarious and ambiguous due to subtle alterations.

Allen Ruppersberg,"Untitled (City Limits) is a series of five black-and-white photographs of road signs, specifically the signs demarcating city limits of several small towns in California. Taken outside Palmdale, Littlerock, Pearlblossom, Victorville, and Barstow, towns where the population does not exceed 20,000, Ruppersberg’s trip follows the outskirts of Los Angeles. As with many of his other photographic series, the artist here inserted into each view a constant element that disturbs the otherwise quiet scenes: a hand holding an open magazine. By pairing each road sign with magazines as diverse as Playboy, Look, Hulk comics, Arizona Highways or Rona Barrett’s Hollywood, Ruppersberg teases the viewer to find a connection between the two.","Like many of his peers in the 1960s, Allen Ruppersberg recognized art as existing not in the isolated realm of aesthetics, but as a practice with a clear political and critical potential, one inextricably immersed in an economic system. Ruppersberg took as source material diverse items stemming from a distinct American form of popular culture of the mid-twentieth century. However, it was perhaps his particular use of everyday rituals to explore different cultural mythologies and narratives that separated him from many conceptual artists of his generation. For a period between the late 1960s and early 1970s, Ruppersberg developed several series of photographs that privileged a certain kind of neutrality, stillness, and emptiness that resembled the seemingly authorless images of mass-produced postcards or calendars. But in his works the artist often hid distinct clues, like an unopened newspaper left on an unmade bed in a hotel room. In this series Ruppersberg was also interested in the suggestion of narrative or uncanny storytelling through the juxtaposition or sequential arrangement of images.",Untitled (City Limits),Americas,"['sign.n.01', 'magazine.n.01', 'city.n.01', 'trip.n.01', 'population.n.01', 'hollywood.n.01', 'comic_strip.n.01', 'los_angeles.n.01', 'town.n.01', 'connection.n.01', 'changeless.s.02', 'component.n.01', 'california.n.01', 'series.n.01', 'hand.n.01', 'photographic.a.01', 'position.n.03', 'scene.n.01', 'spectator.n.01', 'photograph.n.01']","['popular.s.04', 'sign.n.02', 'juxtaposition.n.01', 'photography.n.01', 'hand.n.01', 'los_angeles.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/allen_ruppersberg_-_untitled_city_limits_1970.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/allen_ruppersberg_-_untitled_city_limits_1970-300x81.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/untitled-city-limits/,"['Society/4.272514619883041', 'Cultural/3.5473684210526315', 'Politics/2.377777777777778']","['Society', 'Cultural', 'Politics']",10.197660818713452,"['Urbanization/2.672514619883041', 'Arts/1.9473684210526314', 'Land/1.5555555555555556']","['Urbanization', 'Arts', 'Land']",6.175438596491228,"['Society/17.979280403119414', 'Cultural/15.949627039104092', 'Material_Physical/15.236730589671769']","['Society', 'Cultural', 'Material_Physical']",49.16563803189527,"['Land/12.668476621417799', 'Urbanization/12.044359768198778', 'Media/7.959786721706227']","['Land', 'Urbanization', 'Media']",32.67262311132281,0.6666666666666666,0.6666666666666666
Alexis Smith,"In 8 Ball Surfboard (1995),Alexis Smith combines her long-term interests in California culture and conceptual assemblage. The surfboard, an emblem of Southern California, emblazoned with the image of an eight-ball, references numerous tropes and clichés of American popular culture, specifically subcultures related to pool halls, surfing, and beaches. Indeed, this model-scale surfboard may be a future pop-culture relic, referencing a particular surfer or era of board design.","At a moment when Minimalism and Conceptual Art collided, Southern California-based Alexis Smith began working with discarded street signs, matchbooks, movie posters, and other detritus to become one of the pioneers of conceptual assemblage. Her cryptic comments on the cloudy morality of American culture are derived from pop cultural references including political figures like Richard Nixon, Hollywood films, and pop musicians.

Raphaël Zarka,"This photograph seems to be awaiting meaning, it more or less evokes known elements without really identifying with them completely: a motorway interchange, a bridge, an electric pylon… In fact this is the end of the tracks of the Aérotrain, a wheelless monorail invented by Jean Bertin in the 1970s, which acts like ‘a fossil of movement on landscape scale’, as explained by the artist. This fragmentary place is meant to activate physical movement. It also activates the spectator’s imagination.  The series Les formes du repos is a photographic collection of concrete geometric objects, in undefinable spaces, set aside or in waiting. The photographic document allows the display of these ‘involuntary sculptures’. Paired down geometric forms (whether modernist or futurist) appear tensely in their decor (a field, several buildings on the horizon). This photograph is key in the series, since the tracks are no longer an object but a space. The positioning of the shot emphasises the fragmentary character, the tracks only lead to an empty decor. Observing this defunct functionality, the artist, with Vincent Lamouroux, created Pentacycle (a mono terrain vehicle, 2002) in order to reactivate movement on this ruin.","Raphaël Zarka presents himself as a sculptor and artist-collector. He scrutinises the contemporary world to draw up a genealogy of geometric forms. He is constantly noticing Plato’s polyhedrons (speculative geometric forms) materialized in concrete breakwaters (Les formes du repos series/The Forms of Rest). His work highlights the fact that the ‘survival of forms’ (Aby Warburg) takes place in today’s world in functional and concrete environments. The artist acts with the curiosity of the Renaissance humanists in their studio (Studiolo, 2008), but he has adopted a thinking structure where dichotomies and the methodological boundaries of Art History are banned. With his typical transversal approach, the artist has started theoretical research into the urban practice that is skateboard by publishing essays and realizing artistic projects. In Riding modern art  (Lyon Biennale, 2007), he confronts photographs of the skaters performing on public sculptures with a sculpture by Katarzyna Kobro. The confrontation underlines that the movement is either of aesthetic potential for modern sculpture or a mechanical realization for skating. “It’s almost an insult to the mysteries of the world to think that we could invent anything or that we needed to invent anything”; this quote by Borgès has become the artist’s motto.Raphaël Zarka was born in 1957 in Montpellier, France.

Placing one’s hand on a stable surface helps position the shoulders and the general posture of the body.” Hashem El Madani.  Hashem El Madani, a studio photographer in Saida, began working in 1948. Like all studio photographers his subjects came to him. The studio was a constant flux of visitors. It was perceived as a safe haven, where the subjects of his photographs could act out their fantasies within the conventional format of portrait photography.  Madani records the poses, clothes and behaviour of his clients reflecting the social and political context in which they lived as well as the norms and the taboos. He portrays anonymous personages, people who normally fall below the radar of public interest.","Zaatari combines the skills of a historian, a curator and an artist.

Akram Zaatari,"“Films inspired people a lot. they came to perform kissing in front of a camera. In a conservative society such as Saida, people were willing to play the kiss between two people of the same sex, but very rarely between a man and a woman.I remember only one couple who came to the studio and kissed in front of the camera, and they were not married. The rest of them were people of the same sex. One of them plays the woman, while the other plays the man.” Hashem El Madani.  Hashem El Madani, a studio photographer in Saida, began working in 1948. Like all studio photographers his subjects came to him. The studio was a constant flux of visitors. It was perceived as a safe haven, where the subjects of his photographs could act out their fantasies within the conventional format of portrait photography.  Madani records the poses, clothes and behaviour of his clients reflecting the social and political context in which they lived as well as the norms and the taboos. He portrays anonymous personages, people who normally fall below the radar of public interest.","Zaatari combines the skills of a historian, a curator and an artist. He is interested in salvaging and preserving the past, in challenging the perceived norms of history. ‘Diversity is the most important factor in resisting misrepresentation’ he stated. ‘Focusing on iniduality thus becomes a political mission.’  Akram Zaatari was born in 1966 in Saida, Lebanon.

John Houck,"John Houck’s multi-layered photographic compositions immortalize nostalgic objects from the artist’s childhood, manipulated in the studio and in post-production into unreal still-life arrangements. Stamp -X, Stamp -Y consists of a careful collage of uneven scraps of paper. On their versos, these fragments of blue, white, and manila papers hold the artist’s childhood stamp collection; turned as they are, these shards of envelope become planes of colors that Houck manipulates in a vaguely grid-like fashion.","An MFA graduate from UCLA, John Houck works primarily in the medium of photography and specializes in still-life vignettes. To make his works, Houck arranges an object on a sheet of paper, photographs, and prints it, then places that print back into a new composition, repeating the process again and again until arriving at an aggregate image. The layers appear to be digitally altered, but he does not utilize any postproduction interventions. But Houck is not a purist by any means; he is significantly influenced by his professional experience as a computer programmer, and his artistic methodology mirrors a kind of algorithmic code. By referencing a conventional artistic genre through an iterative and contingent process, Houck offers up photography as a mode of thought.","Stamp -X, Stamp -Y",Americas,"['childhood.n.01', 'fragment.n.01', 'airplane.n.01', 'agreement.n.04', 'document.n.01', 'colors.n.01', 'studio.n.01', 'composition.n.01', 'collage.n.01', 'paper.n.01', 'white.a.01', 'photographic.a.01', 'manner.n.01', 'object.n.01']","['scrap.n.03', 'childhood.n.01', 'collection.n.01', 'unreal.a.02', 'postage.n.02', 'layered.s.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/john_houck_stampx_stampy_web.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/john_houck_stampx_stampy_web-217x300.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/stamp-x-stamp-y/,"['Individual_Personal/4.372405372405373', 'Material_Physical/2.427350427350427', 'Society/1.7692307692307692']","['Individual_Personal', 'Material_Physical', 'Society']",8.56898656898657,"['Familial/1.8571428571428572', 'Body/1.6263736263736264', 'Time/1.5384615384615385']","['Familial', 'Body', 'Time']",5.021978021978022,"['Cultural/9.654537456008045', 'Individual_Personal/6.000621746674379', 'Material_Physical/5.83052503052503']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Material_Physical']",21.485684233207454,"['Time/3.1162393162393167', 'Arts/2.4901960784313726', 'Body/2.4263736263736266']","['Time', 'Arts', 'Body']",8.032809021044315,0.6666666666666666,0.6666666666666666

Shahzia Sikander,"The Last Post was inspired by Sikander’s ongoing interest in the colonial history of the sub-continent and the British opium trade with China. In this animation, layers of images, abstract forms, meaning, and metaphorical associations slowly unfold at the same time that more visual myths are created. The identity of the protagonist, a red-coated official, is indeterminate and suggestive of both the mercantilist policies that led to the Opium Wars with China and the cultural authority claimed by the Company school of painting over colonial India. Though situated in a particular historical context, The Last Post remains an open-ended narrative with infinite possible  interpretations. The work’s scope and complexity is expanded further by its sound element, which was created by Du Yun, an artist and composer based in New York City.","Shahzia Sikander is known for her richly layered and intricately detailed graphite, ink, and gouache paintings. She studied miniature painting in the late 1980s at the National College of Art in Lahore, Pakistan, with the forms and techniques of Indo-Persian miniatures heavily influencing her approach. Sikander’s practice explores the concepts of “East” and “West,” using traditional strategies of storytelling and themes of popular mythology to deconstruct the postcolonial legacy of the Indo-Persian region. In 2001, Sikander began to employ digital animation to create video works based on her drawings.

Chen Shaoxiong,"After engaging primarily with video and photography for more than a decade, Chen turned to painting to explore the issue of urban change and memories—both personal and collective. This “return to origin” reveals an interesting critical reflection on the interactive relation between outside change and internal reflection, and the possibility for more experimental approaches that revive “traditional media.” For Ink Diary, Chen recorded his daily life and impressions within a rapidly-changing urban setting in ink wash paintings which he then turned into an animated film. The complex result of this simple process is both highly innovative and reflective of modernization.","Chen Shaoxiong, was a founding member—along with Lin Yilin and Liang Juhui (and later Xu Tan)—of the well-known artist collective “Big Tail Elephant” which arose in response to the rapid urbanization od Guangzhou in the early 1990s. The group created a large body of multimedia work including performance, photography, video, installation, and paintings. In his solo work, Chen focuses his efforts on the new forms of perception of urban visions and life imposed by the age of information and global travel. Using both new media, like photography and video, and more traditional forms like painting, he produces ironic and uncanny images of a new reality and its constant negotiation between reality and fiction, memory and imagination, past, present and future.",Ink Diary,Asia,"['contemplation.n.02', 'urban.a.01', 'daily.s.01 life.n.01', 'daily.s.01', 'approach.n.01', 'critical.a.01', 'research.v.02', 'traditional.a.01', 'complex.a.01', 'possibility.n.01', 'issue.n.01', 'relation.n.01', 'corporate.s.03', 'personal.a.01', 'consequence.n.01', 'photography.n.01', 'simple.a.01', 'impression.n.01', 'medium.n.01', 'procedure.n.01', 'life.n.01', 'video.n.01', 'movie.n.01']","['memory.n.01', 'urbanization.n.02', 'revival.n.01', 'everyday.s.03', 'china.n.01', 'traditional.a.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/chen_shaoxiong_ink_dairy_2006.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/chen_shaoxiong_ink_dairy_2006-240x300.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/ink-diary/,"['Material_Physical/6.27702589807853', 'Cultural/4.0307692307692315', 'Individual_Personal/3.3956043956043955']","['Material_Physical', 'Cultural', 'Individual_Personal']",13.703399524452157,"['Time/2.8', 'Land/2.6198830409356724', 'Mind/2.5384615384615383']","['Time', 'Land', 'Mind']",7.9583445793972105,"['Cultural/41.83589942049692', 'Individual_Personal/27.06559186427608', 'Society/10.920879120879121']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Society']",79.82237040565212,"['Media/17.59856891474539', 'Mind/10.042881241565452', 'Arts/9.541996015680228']","['Media', 'Mind', 'Arts']",37.183446171991065,0.6666666666666666,0.3333333333333333
Jiang Pengyi,"Unregistered City is a series of eight photographs depicting different scenes of a vacant, apparently post-apocalyptic city: Some are covered by dust and others are submerged by water. Yet, ambiguous lights blink from buildings and yachts still sail on the water, and further observation reveals these structures to be miniatures manipulated by the artist through Photoshop and other postproduction image tools. The model city’s surroundings are themselves real abandoned spaces, perhaps an empty room, a wait-to-be demolished building, or a discarded bathtub. In this way, Unregistered City is a double play on a dystopia vision of urbanization: It is an imagined city built upon the actual ruins of cities and human life. Through a dark and entropic undertone and estranged urban arrangements, the artist does not just critique, but poses fundamental questions.","Jiang Pengyi is a photographer who observes cities through the lens of his camera. His photographs have a dispassionate attitude towards the unprecedentedly fast urbanization of China. Through long-term exposure—sometimes over fifty minutes—and image manipulation, Jiang creates surreal and apocalyptic scenarios that suggest a disastrous future. For Jiang, skyscrapers are spectacles that evidence the mythologization of modern urban life. And by virtue of his technical strategies, the illuminated skyscrapers in Illuminant—a hotel, a government building, a news agency—appear bizarrely alive as if creatures from outer space.

Ho Tzu Nyen,"The Cloud of Unknowing (2011) is titled after a 14th-century medieval treatise on faith, in which “the cloud of unknowing” that stands between the aspirant and God can only be evoked by the senses, rather than the rational mind. In the video, eight protagonists act out their daily lives. The setting is a soon-to-be-demolished public housing facility in Singapore, a country in transition from a mindset of Eastern collectivism to global neoliberalism. These individuals have lived hermetically and absurdly in their apartment space until this moment, when a magical and mysterious cloud appears, connecting their seemingly disjointed lives. It is a story about the tension between solitude and togetherness, privacy and communal experiences. The symbolic cloud embodies both divine illumination and hallucination.","Drawing from historical events, documentary footage, art history, music videos, and mythical stories, Ho Tzu Nyen’s films investigate the construction of history, the narrative of myth, and the plurality of identities. Nyen often collaborates with theater professionals, and the lighting in his films is meticulously orchestrated, the compositions highly aesthetic. Ho also practices painting, performance, and writing, exploring the many possible relationships between stills, painted images, and moving images. His first feature film, HERE, premiered at the 41st Director’s Fortnight at the Cannes Film Festival in 2009. He has exhibited widely, including at the Bienal de São Paulo (2004), the Fukuoka Asian Art Triennale (2005), the Singapore Biennale (2006), the Dojima River Biennale (2009), and the Singapore Pavilion of the Venice Biennale (2011).",The Cloud of Unknowing,Unspecified,"['cloud.n.01', 'apartment.n.01', 'life.n.01', 'daily.s.01 life.n.01', 'supporter.n.01', 'daily.s.01', 'symbolic.a.01', 'passage.n.01', 'global.s.01', 'state.n.04', 'tension.n.01', 'person.n.01', 'public.a.01', 'moment.n.01', 'sense.n.01', 'experience.n.01', 'narrative.n.01', 'space.n.01', 'video.n.01']","['light.n.06', 'collectivism.n.02', 'solitude.n.01', 'transition.n.03', 'westernization.n.01', 'east.n.02']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/ho_tzu_nyen_film_still_from_the_cloud_of_unknowing.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/ho_tzu_nyen_film_still_from_the_cloud_of_unknowing-300x169.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/the-cloud-of-unknowing/,"['Politics/8.307692307692307', 'Society/5.745324283559578', 'Material_Physical/4.0']","['Politics', 'Society', 'Material_Physical']",18.053016591251883,"['Politics/3.5', 'Power/3.269230769230769', 'Environmental/2.307692307692308']","['Politics', 'Power', 'Environmental']",9.076923076923077,"['Material_Physical/10.356177302229934', 'Cultural/10.166844266844267', 'Society/9.800102821155452']","['Material_Physical', 'Cultural', 'Society']",30.323124390229655,"['Media/5.018437118437118', 'Urbanization/2.6183150183150183', 'Geopolitics/2.5555555555555554']","['Media', 'Urbanization', 'Geopolitics']",10.192307692307692,0.6666666666666666,0.0
Eric Baudelaire,"In a society saturated by images, Eric Baudelaire is interested in political events that have not found their representation.  For the film The Anabasis of May and Fusako Shigenobu, Masao Adachi and 27 Years without Images, Baudelaire conducted research on 1970s Japanese cinema and more specifically on Wakamatsu and Masao Adachi’s filmography. In 1971, as the two legendary filmmakers of Japanese Nouvelle Vague were on their way home from a presentation at the Cannes festival, they stopped in Beirut, where their thinking concerning the image took the form of political activism. They made a documentary on the Palestinian struggle. Three years later, Masao Adachi became the writer for the Japanese Red Army Faction, which was linked to the PFLP (Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine).  In this film, the 30 year-long journey of the Japanese Red Army is told by two of its protagonists. As the daughter of the founder of the group, May Shigenobu was a close witness. She was born in hiding in Lebanon and only experienced being in Japan from the age of 27, after the arrest of her mother. Adachi was the theorist of fûkeiron, themovement of filmmakers who shot landscape in order to reveal the omnipresent structures of power. There are no images of his 27 years of voluntary exile since what he filmed in Lebanon was destroyed during the war on three occasions. Therefore The Anabasis of May and Fusako Shigenobu, Masao Adachi and 27 Years without Images is structured through speech, witness accounts and memory (or false memories). The stories are intertwined and reveal complex rapports between militancy, terrorism and cinema.  Thus one wonders whether, once Adachi sided with the armed struggle, he might have continued to think like a director, planning the airplane highjacking or hostage-taking as scripts where actors would be the militants and where television cameras replaced those of the filmmaker.  More broadly, this film considers the role of art and the powerlessness that could lead to the shift from an artistic practice to armed struggle. It follows the shift from a cinematographic image to that of propaganda, and armed propaganda, before concentrating on the reconstruction of missing images.","Eric Baudelaire (b. 1973, Salt Lake City, Utah, United States), currently based in Paris, has developed an oeuvre primarily composed of film, but includes photography, silkscreen prints, performance, publications and installations. In his research-based practice, the artist examines the relationship between images, past events and their documentation. Interested in the role of the cinematographic image as an index marker, Baudelaire creates narratives in which recorded facts serve as a starting point for an exploration of the unknown. In examining the changes in human behavior though interrogating the great political structures that govern the global, national and micro-communities, Baudelaire’s practice could be read through a bio-political perspective. Navigating the experience of urban living, the global, technical and economic dependencies of war, movement and the contemporary paradigm of geographical proximity and distance, Baudelaire’s practice evokes a hauntingly provocative perspective on the current political climate.","The Anabasis of May and Fusako Shigenobu, Masao Adachi, and 27 Years without Images.",Europe,"['japanese.a.01', 'struggle.n.01', 'red.n.01', 'film.n.02', 'shift.n.01', 'uncover.v.01', 'memory.n.01', 'image.n.01', 'political.a.01', 'movie.n.01', 'mother.n.01', 'television.n.01', 'destroy.v.01', 'associate.v.01', 'airplane.n.01', 'reconstruction.n.01', 'militant.n.01', 'address.n.03', 'documentary.n.01', 'age.n.01', 'writer.n.01', 'supporter.n.01', 'presentation.n.01', 'actor.n.01', 'journey.n.01']","['reconstruction.n.03', 'undepicted.s.01', 'activism.n.01', 'memory.n.02', 'testimony.n.02', 'absence.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/lanabase_eric_baudelaire.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/lanabase_eric_baudelaire-300x223.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/the-anabasis-of-may-and-fusako-shigenobu-masao-adachi-and-27-years-without-images/,"['Cultural/2.3555555555555556', 'Material_Physical/2.0', 'Politics/1.0']","['Cultural', 'Material_Physical', 'Politics']",5.355555555555556,"['Mind/1.0', 'Activism/1.0', 'Immaterial/1.0']","['Mind', 'Activism', 'Immaterial']",3.0,"['Cultural/34.88410364145658', 'Individual_Personal/13.549206349206349', 'Politics/8.861152882205515']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Politics']",57.29446287286845,"['Media/16.790271493212668', 'Arts/6.97609710550887', 'Culture/6.2153846153846155']","['Media', 'Arts', 'Culture']",29.981753214106153,0.6666666666666666,0.0
Charles Avery,"Since 2005, Charles Avery has devoted his practice to the perpetual description of a fictional island. Replete with its own population and constantly shifting topography, Avery’s intricately conceived project amounts to an ever-expanding body of drawings, sculptures, installations and texts which evince the island. Exhibited incrementally these heterogeneous elements serve as terms within the unifying structure of the island – as multiple emissions of an imaginary state, and as a meditation on the central themes of philosophy and the problems of art-making. The ultimate destination of Avery’s epic venture is the documentation of this ‘heterotopia’ in a book of many volumes. Avery is one of a number of artists who have promoted a return to narrative. The Kadist Foundation Collection also owns a fictive map by Avery.  This drawing is a medium-sized work in which Avery depicts an event taking place on the island close to the Labour Exchange down by the port. In essence he depicts a dance-off between waiters and itinerant workers who are looking for work on the island. The idea comes from his own experience as a 16 year-old in Italy where he met a Spaniard who had danced his way from Spain to Italy, earning money in the street by doing so. Avery teamed up with him and became the hat carrier, money collector. Avery sees this kind of drawing as a companion to the large architectural views that show the principal buildings on the island and distant views of people. It is as though he is zooming in on a particular incident caught at the edge of a camera lens. The island is of course fictional but it is nevertheless a credible place, a little like Second Life, where characters act out their lives. In fact people are beginning to use the scenarios in their teaching work as though they were real and exemplary of certain true life situations. If there is a fantastical element at all it is redolent of Jabberwocky, Lewis Carroll’s celebrated poem, which has been an important text for Avery. Avery is creating a world which could well be a place on this planet, an island off the coast of his native Scotland, for example, which can be visited by tourists (essentially the role of the viewer) or by those who want to stay there indefinitely (the role of the characters in the drawings).","Charles Avery was born in 1973 in Oban, Isle of Mull, Scotland.

LaToya Ruby Frazier,"LaToya Ruby Frazier is an artist and a militant; her photos combine intimate views of her relation with her parents and grandparents with the history of the Afro-American community of Braddock, Pennsylvania, where she grew up and where her family still live.  She reports upon the decline of this steel-producing town, which was once prosperous and where the local population today is devastated by poverty, unemployment and health problems linked to pollution.  The town has currently closed the hospital which increases unemployment and makes access to treatment complicated for the residents of one of the most polluted towns in the USA.  Through this documentary work with ties to the intimate, she goes beyond the basic information to touch upon the human consequences of these tragedies.  Frazier’s images are embedded in the history of the United States of America and they highlight what is unspoken in the social landscape. Her work is focused on the tragedy of Braddock, a town hit by a slow decay and increasing poverty (steel factories closing, crack epidemic, community debacle, disappearance of shops and urban equipment).  The captioned photographs of protests and advertising are printed with a textured effect, burnt-looking, recalling the “Rusty Belt” nickname for the steel factories of this region.  The portfolio reports on a new wave of devastation, that of a workers’ culture in the process of disappearing.  In 2009, the Levi’s brand chose the town as the backdrop of its new advertising campaign, focusing on the figure of the “new pioneer”.  Frazier mixes photographs of this campaign with others of the town and its protests against the closure and destruction of the hospital in a form of critique of the utilization of this town and its population by Levi’s.

Goshka Macuga,"In this anti-collage, which comes from a series of 4, Macuga takes a photo she found in the archives of Zacheta National Gallery in Warsaw. The series was made on the occasion of her exhibition there in 2011. In 2000, Harald Szeemann curated an exhibition at Zacheta called ‘Beware of Exiting your Dreams: You May Find Yourself in Somebody Else’s.’ The exhibition provoked a violent response as a result of his inclusion of Maurizio Cattelan’s La nona ora, where the figure of the Pope is struck down by a meteor. The work was vandalized by an MP; Anda Rottenberg, the director of the museum received a stream of abusive letters, many of them anti-semitic. Rottenberg organized a series of shows that were regarded by right wing Poles as scandalous and eventually she was forced to leave her post in 2001. In Anti-Collage, Rottenberg, depicted at a ceremony celebrating the centenary of Zacheta at the Presidential Palace, has been silhouetted out of the image. The void represents not only a dark period of Polish cultural history but also reflects upon the way in which history is rewritten in fascistic societies, particularly in former Soviet-style countries where inconvenient memories are erased. Ironically of course she stands between two Polish flags. After destroying Cattelan’s work, the MP, Witold Tomczak, wrote to the Prime Minister not only demanding Rottenberg’s dismissal but also suggesting she should curate in Israel rather than in Poland. Macuga’s image is a timely reminder of cultural vandalism and censorship as well anti-semitism in Poland, alongside the work of Yael Bartana.","She works with archival materials she finds in libraries and museums. Her work often begins with the history of the sites in which she is working, researching the collections of the institutions she works with, the work of artists she is interested in. Sometimes she recreates works by other artists, blurring the boundaries between artist and curator. For example at the Kunsthalle Basel, she recreated a 1971 exhibition of sculptures by Robert Morris that took place at the Tate Gallery in London which was closed by Tate authorities after 4 days as a result of safety scares. Macuga’s recreation allowed the public to experience the danger as well as the avant-garde nature of that exhibition. Her Basel show also engaged with issues relating to Neocolonialism, the arms race and US militancy, bringing together photographs taken by Aby Warburg during his exploration of the Hopi tribe in Arizona in the mid 19th century, a video of her own journey on the footsteps of Warburg and snapshots taken by a Vietnam war veteran that Makuga acquired on the Internet. She juxtaposed these with images of contemporary events relating to Afghanistan and Iraq and the economic crisis. More recently she brought a tapestry of Guernica that normally hangs at the United Nations in New York, to the Whitechapel Gallery in London and used it as a backdrop for public meetings. At documenta in Kassel, she exhibited a tapestry that brought together photographic images of the artists in documenta and a view of people in Kabul. Macuga’s work is engaged with political issues of her times.     Goshka Macuga was born in 1967 in Warsaw (Poland).

Adrian Wong,"Untitled (Grate I/II: Shan Mei Playground/ Grand Fortune Mansion) is part of a series drawn from architectural objects that mark the boundary of public and private spaces Wong encountered while strolling in Hong Kong. Intrigued by the accidental preservation of historical building material by renovations and rebuilding, Wong began paying attention to the experience conveyed by layered forms accreted to affect the visual historicity of a space. The geometric forms in the piece are welded together as a composite replica of a metal grate from a children’s playground next to Wong’s studio, a security grate door from his apartment complex, and the latticework that holds an air conditioner from an electronic store, and a front grate from an elementary school on his bus route. This melding is a recognition of objects that normally recedes into the background of one’s experience in the city by recognizing their role as partitions that break visual fields into parallax spaces or planes of movement.","Born and raised in Chicago, Adrian Wong was originally trained in research psychology at Stanford University. He began making and exhibiting work in San Francisco while concurrently conducting experiments on young children for his Masters degree. Wong’s training in psychology made him aware of the limitation of research methodology, which ultimately redirected his interest to other aspects of his research subjects: “I’m not looking for universal facts; I’m looking for more subjective and affective entry points.” He has been based in Hong Kong, S.A.R. since 2005, where he is the co-founder and director of Embassy Projects, an arts consultancy and independent production studio. His installations, videos, and sculptures draw from varied subjects and explore the intricacies of his relationship to his environment. These relationships, often relying on collaboration with subjects, take on modes of the experiential, historical, and cultural, at times, filtered by fantastical or fictionalized narratives.",Untitled (Grate I/II: Shan Mei Playground/ Grand Fortune Mansion),Asia,"['space.n.01', 'experience.n.01', 'ocular.a.02', 'object.n.01', 'apartment.n.01', 'form.n.01', 'metallic_element.n.01', 'airplane.n.01', 'air.n.01', 'school.n.01', 'shop.n.01', 'geometric.s.01', 'architectural.a.01', 'private.a.01', 'child.n.01', 'background.n.01', 'studio.n.01', 'attention.n.01', 'public.a.01', 'historical.a.01', 'motion.n.03', 'function.n.03', 'city.n.01', 'material.n.01', 'piece.n.01']","['amalgam.n.02', 'division.n.12', 'foreground.v.01', 'history.n.01', 'average.s.02', 'layer.v.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/untitled-grate-iii-shan-mei-playground-grand-fortune-mansion.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/untitled-grate-iii-shan-mei-playground-grand-fortune-mansion-300x198.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/untitled-grate-iii-shan-mei-playground-grand-fortune-mansion/,"['Material_Physical/2.5326203208556146', 'Society/1.0', 'Cultural/0.8421052631578947']","['Material_Physical', 'Society', 'Cultural']",4.374725584013509,"['Time/2.5326203208556146', 'History/1.0', 'Language/0.8421052631578947']","['Time', 'History', 'Language']",4.374725584013509,"['Society/11.377658942364825', 'Material_Physical/8.605056381526968', 'Individual_Personal/8.439835164835165']","['Society', 'Material_Physical', 'Individual_Personal']",28.422550488726955,"['Urbanization/4.556862745098039', 'Geopolitics/4.026143790849673', 'Culture/3.2615384615384615']","['Urbanization', 'Geopolitics', 'Culture']",11.844544997486175,0.6666666666666666,0.0
Sriwhana Spong,"Inspired by the 1934 novella Duo by the French writer Colette, Spong’s film Beach Study (2012)explores ideas of disappearance and the ephemeral, both physically and psychologically. In the film, a female body conducts abstract dance movements on a beach, responding to the environment that surrounds her. This particular beach was one the artist loved as a child, but today it is hardly accessible because it is in the hands of a private landowner. Shot on 16-millimeter film through colored filters, the film has intense flashes of magenta, violet, and amber, and other flickering “light leak” effects. The female body appears and disappears intermittently, creating a surreal and mysterious presence. The overall effect suggests a precarious relationship between memory and experience, transience and monumentality.","Sriwhana Spong, who lives and works in Auckland, New Zealand, is interested in notions of transition, memory, and translation. Her works investigate the relationships between public and private, the intuitive and the cerebral, the body and its surroundings; often her artworks look at the meaningful dialogues and communications that different art forms “in conversation” can generate. She has a background in dance and choreography, and by manipulating sequences of gestures with the traditions and techniques of filmmaking, Spong investigates how dance movements can register particular events in our collective memories. For Spong, the medium of film is an anthropological tool of inquiry in the search for history, narratives, and constructions of time and space.",Beach Study,Asia,"['beach.n.01', 'movie.n.01', 'body.n.01', 'ephemeral.s.01', 'effects.n.01', 'writer.n.01', 'dance.n.01', 'survey.n.01', 'private.a.01', 'child.n.01', 'light.a.01', 'environment.n.01', 'shooting.n.01', 'inspire.v.01', 'relationship.n.01', 'abstract.a.01', 'presence.n.01', 'motion.n.03', 'memory.n.01', 'experience.n.01', 'idea.n.01']","['transience.n.01', 'bodied.s.02', 'dance.n.01', 'memory.n.02', 'retrieval.n.02', 'embodiment.n.03']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/sriwhana_spong_beach_study_5_6.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/sriwhana_spong_beach_study_5_6-300x169.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/beach-study/,"['Cultural/7.6274509803921555', 'Material_Physical/5.169561157796452', 'Individual_Personal/1.9333333333333333']","['Cultural', 'Material_Physical', 'Individual_Personal']",14.730345471521941,"['Arts/4.40392156862745', 'Time/2.7904761904761903', 'Mind/1.9333333333333333']","['Arts', 'Time', 'Mind']",9.127731092436974,"['Cultural/27.36483875601523', 'Individual_Personal/23.638095238095243', 'Material_Physical/22.476276664511964']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Material_Physical']",73.47921065862243,"['Mind/9.184615384615386', 'Culture/8.861990950226247', 'Media/7.422649572649573']","['Mind', 'Culture', 'Media']",25.469255907491206,1.0,0.3333333333333333

Jennifer Bornstein,"Collectors’ Favorites is an episode of local cable program from the mid-1990s in which ordinary people were invited to present their personal collections—a concept that in many ways anticipates current reality TV shows and internet videos. When it comes her turn to “perform,” Bornstein displays mundane and disposable—but elaborately archived or framed—consumer objects such as coffee lids, plastic straws, candy wrappers, and product labels. Through the medium of public broadcasting, then, she makes visual the frequently overlooked but massive cultural penetration of advertising, and its proliferation of “throwaway culture” via images. Further, Bornstein suggests that within a massive and mercurial social network that often places value arbitrarily, any worthless mass-market products can be turned into coveted objects via absurd relations and vice versa.","Jennifer Bornstein’s works range from performance, conceptual photography, film, drawing, and  etchings to curatorial practice.

The literal production of a photograph—the process of photo developing and printing—is the work’s subject, and Beshty slyly points to the ways in which these material processes possess their own aesthetic appeal and content.","Walead Beshty explores photography’s ability to capture contemporary social and political conditions. Often striking in their visual presence, his work reflects the circulation of images both in a general sense and in the literal movement of photographs and objects. They also convey another narrative: the history and the processes that construct both the world and his art.","Black Curl (CMY/Five Magnet: Irvine, California, March 25, 2010, Fujicolor Cyrstal Archive Super Type C, EM No 165-021, 05910)",Americas,"['type.n.01', 'black.n.01', 'rhythm.n.01', 'production.n.01', 'california.n.01', 'aesthetic.a.01', 'photograph.n.01', 'compose.v.01', 'abstract.a.01', 'shape.n.01', 'subject.n.01', 'procedure.n.01', 'make.v.03', 'material.n.01', 'time.n.01', 'image.n.01']","['materiality.n.02', 'development.n.08', 'abstraction.n.04', 'color.n.08', 'geometric.s.01', 'rhythm.n.02']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/walead_besthy_black_curl.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/walead_besthy_black_curl-155x300.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/black-curl-cmyfive-magnet-irvine-california-march-25-2010-fujicolor-cyrstal-archive-super-type-c-em-no-165-021-05910/,"['Material_Physical/4.609090909090909', 'Cultural/3.4960440316477466', 'Individual_Personal/1.6']","['Material_Physical', 'Cultural', 'Individual_Personal']",9.705134940738656,"['Arts/3.4960440316477466', 'Materiality/2.909090909090909', 'Land/0.9']","['Arts', 'Materiality', 'Land']",7.305134940738656,"['Cultural/23.857823059293654', 'Individual_Personal/12.030280830280832', 'Society/11.138217338217341']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Society']",47.026321227791826,"['Culture/5.503296703296703', 'Arts/4.901373626373626', 'Design/4.36524064171123']","['Culture', 'Arts', 'Design']",14.76991097138156,0.6666666666666666,0.3333333333333333
Wallace Berman,"While Untitled (Shuffle) presents the same formal characteristics as the rest of Berman’s verifax collages, this constellation of specific images inside the radio’s frames—the Star of David, Hebrew characters, biblical animals—have Jewish symbolism and attest to the artist’s lasting obsession with the kabala. The piece’s sub-title, “Shuffle,” suggests the presence of chance and randomness in any given organization of elements.","Wallace Berman was one of San Francisco’s more important avant-garde artists and is considered by many to have been the father of the Californian assemblage movement (a title he could probably dispute with Edward Kienholz). Characteristically unruly, Berman was an active member of the San Francisco and Los Angeles Beat communities in the mid-1950s. In 1963 he settled in Topanga Canyon and started to develop the body of work for which he would become most famous. The verifax machine, a precursor of the photocopy machine, lent the name to the series of collages with which Berman experimented until his death in 1976. The structural compositional element that unifies the series is the image, appropriated from a magazine, of a hand holding a transistor radio. By photocopying and reproducing the image in sequential form on top of the canvas, Berman mimics the pattern produced by an old film reel. Inside the frame of each radio, the artist superimposed imagery—people, objects and symbols, often taken from pop culture—pertinent to that particular sequence of the work.",Untitled (Shuffle),Americas,"['opportunity.n.01', 'star.n.01', 'specific.a.01', 'formal.a.01', 'collage.n.01', 'presence.n.01', 'elements.n.01', 'fictional_character.n.01', 'piece.n.01', 'image.n.01']","['randomness.n.02', 'collage.n.01', 'spirituality.n.02', 'appropriation.n.03', 'photocopy.n.01', 'superimpose.v.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/wallace_berman_shuffle_1969.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/wallace_berman_shuffle_1969-300x275.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/untitled-shuffle/,"['Cultural/9.046631473102062', 'Individual_Personal/1.8421052631578947', 'Society/0.8']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Society']",11.688736736259958,"['Design/3.111111111111111', 'Media/1.75', 'Arts/1.6470588235294117']","['Design', 'Media', 'Arts']",6.508169934640522,"['Material_Physical/14.520859841912475', 'Individual_Personal/11.27182586934909', 'Cultural/9.761161387631976']","['Material_Physical', 'Individual_Personal', 'Cultural']",35.55384709889354,"['Space/8.665548486601118', 'Materiality/4.998168498168498', 'Mind/4.042663219133807']","['Space', 'Materiality', 'Mind']",17.70638020390342,0.6666666666666666,0.0

Arseniy Zhilyaev,"Arseniy Zhilyaev (born 1984 in Voronezh, Russia) is an artist, writer and political activist who lives and works in Moscow and Voronezh. Zhilyaev’s artistic practice poses questions about the ?ultural production in the postsoviet condition.  To trace Arseniy Zhilyaev’s work, one should span from the avant-garde of the 1920’s to the ‘shock therapy’ of the 1990’s in Russia. As a member of the young generation of Russian artists, Zhilyaev looks at the changes of his country through the 20th century to compose his works. With a specific attention of art’s relations to politics, education and pedagogy, Arseniy Zhilyaev reflects on the different roles of the museum and exhibition making. Despite the current use of art as entertainment, Zhilaev wants to rethink the museum as an educational institution connecting art and history. His references include soviet museology, architecture and design of the avant-garde or experimental exhibition making of the late 1920.  ?????? ??? (delay sam) or “do it yourself” is a work in progress descried by the artist as a research in the tradition of the Soviet and post-Soviet culture of non-professional worker’s folk art. “Usually ordinary people in the Soviet Union had no opportunity to frequently change the furniture according to their taste. But they could do it by themselves! It was during that period that workers’ amateur creativity flourished, exemplified in techniques such as woodcarving, hammered ironwork or amateur furniture design. It was part of free time, type of creative hobby. It was called ‘creative relaxation’. The strict division between work and leisure during the era of late socialism made this creativity possible. It was an extremely democratic art and this is what still inspires me today.”","Arseniy Zhilyaev (born 1984 in Voronezh, Russia) is an artist, writer and political activist who lives and works in Moscow and Voronezh.

He graduated from the school of Fine Arts of Saint-Etienne, and he now lives and works in Paris while expanding his carrier internationally.  Like On Kawara, Stanley Brouwn or Roman Opalka, Bernard Piffaretti is also a “protocol artist”. He has imposed a few restrictions on his work, resulting in a protocol set as of 1986, which the artist has followed from then on. It is called the “Piffaretti System.”  Piffaretti’s work is based on a system of duplication on a single canvas. The painter starts painting indifferently on the left or right side of the canvas, and reproduces the result from memory on the other side, separating both sides by a central vertical line.  An image is produced – which is neither the model, nor the copy. It is impossible to perceive which one of the two patterns was the first one. They are both similar like approximate clones. There is no first time. The story stutters as of the beginning.  Without any stylistic unit, Bernard Piffaretti’s paintings are very different from one another. The protocol suspends time. The opposition copy/original disappears.","Bernard Piffaretti was born in 1955 in Saint-Etienne.

Adrien Missika,"Adrien Missika follows in the footsteps of the Brazilian landscape architect and artist Roberto Burle Marx (1909-1994), a designer of gardens, parks and promenades  who introduced modern landscape architecture to Brazil. Marx’s work is characterized by the use of native tropical vegetation as a structural element of design. He worked with Oscar Niemeyer and Lucio Costa, the architects of Brazilia, and with them, the tropical plant became a motif in urban architecture. His garden in Guaratiba or the Copacabana mosaic walk in Rio, are some of his well-known interventions.  Like the Brazilian landscape architect and artist Roberto Burle Marx who, sensitive to the temporal and ephemeral nature of architecture and civilizations, readily recycled architectural elements for his creations, Adrien Missika recovered the windows of a 60s Geneva building to be demolished and used them in a new context. On some of them, he placed images of palm, banana and pineapple leaves were placed, which the artist had scanned with a hand scanner, as a radical hyper-technological and manual way to record the reality and to bring back images from his travels. Using the figure of the 19th century explorer and scientist, the leaf isn’t kept for a collection but recorded to become an architectural motif. Here, the window doesn’t offer a perspective on a landscape but is only serves as memorabilia of what Nature was.","Adrien Missika (1981, Paris, France) studied and developed his career in Lausanne where he founded 1m3 artspace. Adrien Missika uses a wide range of media (photography, video, installation) to share his findings from travels in the USA, Hawaii, Turkmenistan, India, Lebanon, Brazil, to name a few. Missika portrays himself as a ‘professional tourist’ and his work plays on the idea of an exotic representation of these localities. There, he would look for natural elements (rocks, plants, lava) as much as iconic architecture such as Niemeyer’s dome in Tripoli (Lebanon), that he sometimes activates, records and transforms for the mediated experience of the gallery space.",Botanical Frottage (Lauren),Europe,"['architecture.n.01', 'tropical.s.01', 'garden.n.01', 'motif.n.01', 'landscape.n.01', 'architectural.a.01', 'nature.n.01', 'windows.n.01', 'window.n.01', 'creation.n.01', 'bring.v.01', 'intervention.n.01', 'ephemeral.s.01', 'century.n.01', 'design.n.01', 'component.n.01', 'modern.a.01', 'hand.n.01', 'urban.a.01', 'image.n.01', 'building.n.01', 'context.n.01', 'elements.n.01', 'world.n.03', 'position.n.03']","['architecture.n.02', 'leaf.n.01', 'window.n.01', 'nature.n.03', 'explorer.n.01', 'tropical.s.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/missika_botanical_frottage_lauren_web.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/missika_botanical_frottage_lauren_web-200x300.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/botanical-frottage-lauren/,"['Cultural/12.493412452700381', 'Material_Physical/5.970940170940171', 'Individual_Personal/3.23486544415337']","['Cultural', 'Material_Physical', 'Individual_Personal']",21.69921806779392,"['Arts/5.230994152046784', 'Technology/4.083333333333333', 'Space/2.6153846153846154']","['Arts', 'Technology', 'Space']",11.929712100764732,"['Cultural/34.20429325576385', 'Individual_Personal/19.265653953889252', 'Society/16.46703296703297']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Society']",69.93698017668606,"['Arts/15.377400703871295', 'Culture/7.041758241758242', 'Mind/5.534065934065934']","['Arts', 'Culture', 'Mind']",27.95322487969547,0.6666666666666666,0.3333333333333333
Pablo Pijnappel,"In Felicitas, we follow the converging routes of three characters: Felicitas, Michael and Andrew (the artist’s father-in-law who also features elsewhere). Felicitas is thedaughter of a German industrialist who immigrated to Rio after the Second World War. She is the one visible with a toucan in several images. In his work, Pablo Pijnappel privileges pre-existing images – the slides presented here are photographs found in his family archives or from other sources (media, photographs of film sets…). Sometimes, the same image is used several times with a different caption, thus encapsulating other meanings. Presented in the form of an installation with three synchronized slide projectors, Felicitas offers a complex scenario, where text and images can simultaneously be descriptive, intermingled or completely autonomous. Disjunctions and repetitions create the pace: the captioned images appear one after the other, with no regular order, sometimes on the left, in the centre or on the right. Even though the story follows a certain chronology, it is not linear and looks more like a complex collage of images and anecdotes which overlap. The text does not illustrate the images but functions as a complement that allows for the creation of multiple readings of the characters, of their lives, their trips and encounters. These collages are a mixture of real and fictional stories that enable Pijnappel to play with the notion of the documentary. The subtitles are in an informative tone, but they are mostly subjective and imagined commentaries thus creating what can be called a documentary fiction. This artwork has cinematographic qualities while deconstructing those conventions. Chris Marker’s film La jetée in which the relation between voice-over and still images creates a space for free interpretation was a likely direct influence.","Pablo Pijnappel’s work is foremost highly constructed. He builds narrations based on anecdotes and everyday events, perhaps souvenirs, family legends or plain fictions. The non-linear use of different archives and film extracts highlights this uncertainty and contributes to the loss of these stories over time. The works only offer pauses and silent moments, allowing the investment of our imagination.

Jonathan Monk,"Untitled (rolled up), is an abstract portrait of Owen Monk, the artist’s father and features an aluminum ring of 56.6 cm in diameter measuring 1.77 cm in circumference, the size of his father. Jonathan Monk bridges a conceptual art and his family privacy, and ironically ensures that there is “no difference between Sol Lewitt and my mother, he does not know more than she do not know. ” What is the status of the O-backed chair rail to the white cube? Monk gives us some clues. The O is an initial, the letter contains the first letter of Owen. The O is also a sign, the letter contains the restaurant sign Owen. The O of Untitled (rolled up) is thought of as an encrypted letter. The work, while it appears as a joke (?), plays upon everything. Monk questions the meaning of a work through non-conventional logic.","To enter an exhibition by Jonathan Monk is like taking part of a treasure hunt, made up by digressions and space-time manipulations. In his “Meeting pieces” (a wall text in the exhibition space indicating an appointment in the distant future), the meeting is uncertain. The amount and variety of his works, poses the question of what supports them. Monk’s art does not follow any style, there is no characteristic that could help to identify his work at first glance. Monk’s reading of the myth of contemporary art is through the prism of humor, irony, and anecdote. Jonathan Monk was born in 1969 in Leicester, UK.

Dora Garcia,"Dora Garcia’s work is a result of institutional critique and more generally that of language, following the conceptual artists of the 1960s like Weiner and Kosuth and Fraser from the 1980s and 1990s. What a fucking wonderful audience (2008) is positioned conveniently at the crossroads of several trends identified in the work of the artist.  The performance from which it is derived, was made at the Biennale of Sydney in 2008, taking the form of a guided tour at the Museum of Modern Art in Sydney and focuses on artworks that were not physically present. A performer acts as a traditional museum guide and offers visitors a guided tour that comments on several controversial works from art and film history like “Cosmococa” by Oiticica, “Kunst Kick “by Chris Burden, “The Society of Spectacle” by Guy Debord.  In the script of the tour guide, Garcia makes connections between these works and various authors whose approach was to question the position of the viewer and the artist within the institution. Included in the work are annotated framed index cards originating from the performance in Sydney.  The printed text includes text written entirely by Dora Garcia, while the annotations stem from the performer, who clarifies or contradicts the discourse of the artist and uses it for his tour. The framed photograph documents the performance. Garcia never carries out personal performances, rather, she commissions professional actors. Being in relative distance to the viewer, she establishes a distinct relationship between performer and audience. This performance matches up to projects like The Beggar’s Opera, presented at the Skulptur Projekte de Münster for which the artist spoiled the expectations of the visitors. For those who continued to search for a sculpture by Dora Garcia, they found instead an actor playing the role of a beggar whose adventures were recorded on a blog.","Dora Garcia was born in 1965 in Valladolid, Spain.

Lars Laumann,"Eija Riitta was born in 1954 in Liden, Sweden, and is “objectum-sexual.” Since June 17, 1979, her name is Eija Riitta Berliner Mauer taking the name of her husband, the Berlin Wall. In animism all elements of nature are considered as alive and have souls.  “Objectum-sexuality” is an extension of this belief. Eija’s blog explains the situation perfectly – her attraction to rectangular parallel lines, constructions such as bridges, fences or the Berlin Wall. Furthermore, this can be witnessed at her house, now the “Museum of models and guillotines,” a subject that she is equally passionate about. More than a documentary on the subject, Lars Laumann filmed the encounter between two lovers of the Berlin Wall. In the video, we come to realize that the first woman married the wall before the war, clinging to the memory of what it was, while the second fell in love with the Berlin Wall after its destruction. Surprisingly, these women do not consider the wall as a symbol of political history, but more as an independent object of history. The first woman fell love with the wall for its lines, its strength, its breadth, while the other for its colors, its fragmentation, and its fragility. In presenting this film in an artistic context, Laumann makes a surprising parallel between “objectum-sexuality” and art. To contemplate a work for its formal aspects, refers to Eija’s speech which considers the Berlin Wall as a free being, without any responsibility of which he is charged. Thus, the destruction of the wall, as Eija claims, is as an act of barbarism, of an innocent person.","The films of Lars Laumann incorporate codes of documentary, grappling with topics at the limits of fiction. This process of fictional documentary recalls the practices some artists in the Kadist collection like Omer Fast, Joachim Koester, John Menick, Akram Zaatari, Arthur Zmijewski. In 2007, Matthew Higgs presented, at White Columns Gallery (New York), Laumann’s first film, “Morrissey Foretelling the Death of Diana” which claims that the Smiths album “Queen is Dead” produced in 1986, announces the death of Princess Diana in 1997 in Paris. Illustrated in a film montage, the narrator’s discourse draws parallels between the surprising words belonging to pop culture and events that occurred years later. Lars Laumann’s analysis takes as a starting point the iconic figure of Diana, and develops a “conspiracy theory” by claiming extraterrestrial involvement in those events, thus offering a vision of a world entirely controlled.

Omer Fast,"In this work, Omer Fast probes the feelings experienced by young people involved in an acts of war. Four monitors installed in the form a chariot of war relay the words and faces of four young Israeli soldiers. The installation shows a young generation confronted by the reality of danger, whether being attacked or facing death. The external situation of war lies is in parallel with their inner thoughts of the soldiers who fear a possibility of error in their actions. The intensity of the situation is not revealed by disaster shots nor depictions of ruins, but rather is revealed through their expressions. Omer Fast questions the words used to translate this experience by tweaking lightly the subtitles of their testimonies, and therefore creates a shift of meaning and implied subtext.","In his videos and installations, Omer Fast links and merges personal stories, collective history reality and fiction as well as experience and one’s making of it. Fast is interested in different types of discourse carried out in contemporary political and social events. In the work CNN concatenated (2002), for instance, an American journalist’s speech is modified to deliver a different meaning. Omer Fast was born in 1972 in Jerusalem, Israel.

Maaike Schoorel,"This is one of the most important works Schoorel has made to date, a triptych that has as its subject matter a garden scene with what looks like a pond. One of her largest works, it seems highly suited to a Parisian collection where Monet’s Nympheas in the Orangerie represent the summit of treatments of such subjects. Typically for Schoorel, the painting is as much about absence as presence and examines the amount of information the viewer needs to construct meaning. Delicate stains and touches of paint describe the subject which is contingent and evanescent. These are paintings that require slow readings, allowing the eye to adjust and to assemble information. Time is an important theme in the work; not simply the time it takes to decipher it but time associated with memory, a faculty the painting appears to emblematize. Like all Schoorel’s work, the painting is based on a photograph and therefore a scene she experienced. The temporality of the work is not that of the camera from which the image is derived, but that of painting itself. The Garden was shown in “Visible Invisible : Against the Security of the Real” at Parasol Unit, London from November 2009 to February 2010.","Based on photographs and domestic environments, Schoorel’s paintings are charged with an atmosphere of melancholy and loss. In her paintings images emerge slowly. Her figurative paintings appear faded or bleached with brush strokes that suggest outlines and restrained marks that imply areas of colour or shadow. The viewer must participate in the paintings, employing a particular way of looking that allows the images to unravel slowly over time. The spaces they provide are not only physical, but also conceptual – the freedom to find pleasure in their beauty, or to find consolation in the way in which they transform memory from an image of yesterday into a fresh, present-day experience.

Dominique Petitgand,"A woman pronounces parts of sentences. Via rigorous editing, the artist creates  anticipation with the silences, rhythm by the repetitions, temporal ellipses with music. The recording is diffused by a loud speaker placed on a plinth which gives the whole an anthropomorphic status which reminds one of Box with the sound of its own making by Robert Morris. “For me this is an emblematic piece of work. In fact Le bout de la langue could be the generic title of a large part of my work. Seemingly […] everything is obvious: the mental process along the way, speech is captured by disfunctional memory”. (« Notes, voix, entretiens », page 97). This metalinguistic artwork questions language in its relation to memory (blanks or losses) via fixed expressions: “Don’t you see, I can’t remember […] I have it on the tip of my tongue and it annoys me, […] Don’t you see what I mean”. The density of the silences emphasizes the failing memory, the voice can only be quiet. Petitgand’s characters spend their time trying to make an inventory, to classify, to order. Somewhere between a soliloquy and a monologue, the spoken sequences reintroduce a certain communication with the spectator who can become emotionally involved or have their imagination stimulated.","Dominique Petitgand makes sound pieces.  “I can’t make audible the world in its entirety. Only what is in motion, in action, animated, agitated or touched. To capture the presence of a tree, I need wind or an announcement saying ‘tree’ (always in an indirect mode)”, as the artist explained (in his book The missing pieces).version anglaise p.21 Snippets of recorded conversations are assembled and edited with blanks in the dialogues, background sounds (surround sound, bodily sounds) and music. In some more abstract works like Exhalaisons (Exhalations), the human being becomes a fragment reduced to the noise of a mouth or to breathing – a presence remains. The artist uses different modes of listening depending on the exhibition context, from domestic distribution (records, books) to public diffusion (concerts, installations). In terms of propagation in space, sound has no limits whereas images can only exist within its own limits (the frame). Petitgand’s artworks embrace any architectural constraints for optimum deployment in space. Petitgand’s sound pieces are constructions of sensations and affects that produce alterations on the spectator who is immersed in an environment via different emission sources and echos; there is no escaping the sound.Dominique Petitgand was born in 1965 in Laxou, France.

Daria Martin,"Soft Materials is a curious, touching but also disturbing sequence of confrontations between two people: a man and a woman, and machines. Shot in the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory at the University of Zurich, the humans and the machines mirror each other’s actions. It is unclear which party takes the lead. Do the humans mimic the machines or are the machines following the humans? Each of the protagonists, whether human or mechanical, are vulnerable and naked –the humans stripped of clothing and the machines lacking protective covering. Like the celebrated film “Ballet Mechanique” by Leger, Martin’s film suggests the erotics of the mechanised world. The film evokes a history of modernist aspiration for utopia where man and machine would become bedfellows or at least entirely complimentary. The machines learn to think and act like humans echoing their appearance and actions. The work references both American body performance art of the 1960s and 1970s as well as Robert Morris’s work “Neoclassic” in which a naked dancer was filmed interacting with his sculptures at the Tate Gallery in 1971 in a series of peaceful, trancelike actions.","A number of Daria Martin’s films explore the relationship between humans and machines and make reference to modernist art, whether through the work of the Bauhuas (Schlemmer), Surrealism (Giacometti’s Palace at 4 AM) or American art of the 1960s and 1970s. Her films involve performance and many are shown as 16mm projections – assembling memories, reveries, scholarly research, and imported citations drawn from a wide range of sources including early twentieth century painting, sculpture, fashion, stage, and dance productions. “I came to the medium of film because of its open potential,” writes Daria Martin, “Its invitation to travel through time and space within an imagined world.” The artist values the contradictions of the medium of film, in particular the tension between the private fantasy it stimulates and the public physicality on which it depends.

Julius Koller,"Anti-Happening refers to Koller’s 1965 manifesto, ‘Anti-Happening (System of Subjective Objectivity)’. In opposition to the notion of a ‘happening’ as a way of actualising group identity, in his manifesto, Koller stated that his concept of the ‘anti-happening’ aimed at a ‘cultural reshaping of the subject, at awareness, at the surroundings and the real world’ [i]. Unlike happenings, these actions do not involve the staging of psychologically expressive performances.  As the art historian Piotr Petrowski has noted, it is part of ‘an attitude that aims to erase the boundaries between different art tendencies (art and anti-art, modernist and neo-avant-garde painting), between different forms of neo-avant-garde practice (performance, conceptual art, Fluxus) and, above all, between art and life’[ii].  [i] Kathrin Rhomberg and Roman Ondák (eds.), Julius Koller: Univerzálne Futurologické Operácie, Cologne 2003. p.126.    [ii] Piotr Piotrowski, In the Shadow of Yalta: Art and the Avant-Garde in Eastern Europe, 1945–1989, London 2009.","In its stringency, obsession and peculiarity, the oeuvre of Julius Koller is one of the most idiosyncratic and consistent in European art since the 1960s. Yet Koller is not only a seminal figure in the history of the neo- and post-avant-garde; his work has long been a critical inspiration for artists and intellectuals. In the most recent past, Koller’s concepts of the Anti-Happening, the Anti-Picture, the Universal-cultural Futurological Operation (U.F.O.), his actions, objects, texts and the enormous referential archive he built up, have attracted growing interest on the part of a broader art public.  From around 1960, in response to the modernist mainstream in Slovak art, Julius Koller began to develop his aesthetic position of the “antihappening.” His strategy consists in using real objects and everyday life as the predefined program for an aesthetic operation: from 1965, in texts rubberstamped on paper that refer to the context of the “anti-happening,” and then in 1967/1968 in pictures for which Koller used white latex paint instead of oils and which saw the first appearance of the question mark—the symbol of Koller’s brands of naming, or “making known,” that was later to undergo many mutations in various media and states of aggregation. The “invitation cards for an idea”—as Koller called the text works relating to the “anti-happenings”—and the palimpsests and serial arrangements of the “anti-pictures” set themselves apart from the academicism of Modernism in more than just formal terms. Koller foregoes every form of technical mastery. The “anti-pictures” are amateurish in style, ensuring that they fulfill their task, defined by Koller as “engaging rather than arranging.”Julius Koller was born in 1939 in Piestany, Slovakia.

Young-Hae Chang Heavy Industries,"Pacific Limn weaves together three narratives that comment on hyper-capitalism pan-Pacific cities that San Francisco exemplifies. Each of the large works comprise of moving images overlaid with giant text, all synched to a stealthy, up-tempo jazz soundtrack. In The Secret Life of Harumi, a Japanese woman fantasizes escaping her job and living a temporary dream life in San Francisco. Young-Hae Chang Heavy Industries (YHCHI) uses locally sourced virtual products such as Adobe Flash animation and Apple’s Monaco or Menlo typeface to create a whimsical and indirect commentary on the psychology of the working class in an information society within postindustrial imperialism. For two months, YHCHI inhabited the economically polarized South of Market neighborhood, where a variety of socioeconomic realities overlap and coexist, from Facebook employees to the homeless. The Flash animation is influenced by realist cinema and depicts the tediousness in commuting by air and ground combined with the kitsch of an “Asia-town” window display. Overlaid with text-like femslash prose in a semi-coherent style of karaoke lyrics, the sensory cacophony disrupts a viewer’s thoughts and alludes to a desensitized boredom mixed with the desires of the alternative persona of a fictional Japanese woman.","Young-Hae Chang Heavy Industries is a Seoul-based Web art group consisting of Young-hae Chang and Marc Voge formed in 1999. Chang is a Korean artist and translator with a Ph.D in aesthetics from Universite de Paris I, and Marc Voge is an American poet living in Seoul. Their work tends to combine text with jazz to create Flash animation pieces. This combination is a simple technique that shuns interactivity, graphics, photos, illustrations, banners, colors, but at the same time transgresses the boundaries between digital animation, motion graphics, experimental video, i-movies, and e-poetry.",PACIFIC LIMN,Asia,"['japanese.a.01', 'san_francisco.n.01', 'woman.n.01', 'window.n.01', 'film.n.02', 'life.n.01', 'virtual.s.01', 'air.n.01', 'market.n.01', 'display.n.01', 'south.n.01', 'dream.n.01', 'land.n.04', 'fictional.a.01', 'desire.n.01', 'society.n.01', 'manner.n.01', 'world.n.03', 'narrative.n.01', 'city.n.01', 'make.v.03', 'spectator.n.01']","['fantasy_life.n.01', 'gentrification.n.01', 'desensitization.n.01', 'line.n.05', 'animation.n.05', 'kitsch.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/japan_1_web.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/japan_1_web-300x169.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/pacific-limn/,"['Cultural/13.015452847805792', 'Individual_Personal/3.202614379084967', 'Material_Physical/2.3790849673202614']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Material_Physical']",18.59715219421102,"['Arts/6.131302521008403', 'Language/2.666666666666667', 'Fantasy/2.593954248366013']","['Arts', 'Language', 'Fantasy']",11.391923436041083,"['Individual_Personal/23.158175158175165', 'Cultural/19.75951287274817', 'Society/18.017289452893166']","['Individual_Personal', 'Cultural', 'Society']",60.9349774838165,"['Emotion/13.181618381618385', 'Land/11.20237017884077', 'Media/8.072125260360554']","['Emotion', 'Land', 'Media']",32.45611382081971,0.6666666666666666,0.0
Apichatpong Weerasethakul,"Haunted Houses is a video in which villagers near Weerasethakul’s hometown of Khon Kaen were re-enact scenes from the popular Thai soap opera Tong Prakaisad. By encouraging villagers to play dramatic characters whose fates they had followed intimately, the video comments on the manner in which real experience and fantasy mediate and feed back to each other. Weerasethakul calls this phenomenon ‘medium addiction,’ a term describing a continual Thai fascination with spirits that dwell in a world parallel to everyday life. Critically aware of the mediums of film and video, Weerasetahkul’s works capture the manner through which traditional ways of mediating and perceiving the world is transcoded into new forms through new media. With filmed subjects entering television fantasies as easily as the television characters’ entering the living rooms and families of the viewers, Haunted Houses reflects the multiple other-worlds haunting the contemporary Thai consciousness in light of new communication technologies brought on by modern infrastructures, urban planning, and modern medicine.","Born in Bangkok, Thailand in July 1970, Apichatpong Weerasethakul is an independent filmmaker initially trained in architecture at Khon Kaen University. After receiving a Masters degree in filmmaking from the Art Institute of Chicago in 1997, Weerasethakul commenced a prodigious career in experimental cinema that awarded him the Jury Prize and Palm d’Or at the Cannes International Film Festival for Uncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives in 2010.

Qiu Anxiong,"A Portrait: Covering and Cleaning is an installation of six black-and-white video projections. Each video depicts a portrait with features changing continuously and quickly into different persons, animals and symbols. Driven by the evolving contents of the screen itself, this piece showcases the form and material of Qiu Anxiong’s working method, which relies on precisely planned storyboard sketches drawn in pen on A4 paper. After the narrative is fully formed, Qiu transfers each image by painting it onto a small canvas with acrylic, which can be quickly wiped away to prepare for the subsequent image or element to be painted on top. Such process distills an aesthetics of over-painting that drives narrative development through changing logical relationships between material and form rather than plot elements.","Qiu Anxiong is part of a new generation of Chinese artists synthesizing Chinese culture and history with global contemporary art through addressing new utopias produced by real conditions of globalization. After studying at the Sichuan Art Academy in Chongqing, China and graduating with emphases in contemporary international art and traditional Chinese culture from University of Kassel’s College of Art in Germany, Qiu rose to international prominence in the 2006 Shanghai Biennial with a video work titled New Book of the Mountains and Seas.

Andrew Grassie,"In 2008, Grassie was invited by the Whitechapel Gallery to document the transformation of some of its spaces. The artist chose to depict the space before and after, thus creating the series titled “After the Archive Collections Room.” This group of paintings displays a space locked into time with its scaffolding and broom exposed, depicted just before an exhibition on a collection of archives.","The hyper-realistic paintings of Andrew Grassie combine know-how and classic technique with a conceptual approach. “Painting as document” as the artist suggests consists of exhibition or studio views that are photographed and maintain their same scale. The question of the exhibition, the choice of works, and their hanging appears central to Andrew Grassie who like a curator creates protocols to create his series. In “Group Show” (2003), he assembles a group of works, photographs them one by one, and uses the photographic support putting as a matrix for further paintings.  The exhibition only exists through this final painting, like in his other project “Tate New Hang” (2004-05) which shows points of view of the hanging of the collection, later to be realized to be in painting. The paintings are hung in the location suggested by the terms described.  Andrew Grassie was born in 1966 in Edinburgh, UK.

Pascal Grandmaison,"Solo (2003) is a video exhibited as a video/sound installation depicting shots of drum, voice, guitar, clavier/synthesizer, and a melodica player cut into segmented fragments from the perspective of a studio recording set. Rather than deploying a narrative strategy, Grandmaison focuses on the gestures of the musicians and the repetitions they carry out when recording their individual tracks. The musicians are portrayed nodding, dancing, improvising, strumming, creating resonance that is repeated over and over– however, Grandmaison is sure not to document their entire faces or expressions while they perform, just details. Similar to that of a “jam,” close attention is granted to the exertion of the camera and how it portrays the framing of sequences. What one can pick up from the segments, especially those of voice recording, is a modified reworking of Anne Clark’s 1980’s track “Sleeper in the Metropolis.”","Marked by an apparent austerity and meticulousness, Pascal Grandmaison’s works display a disconcerting aloofness from the world, a clearly asserted detachment from reality. The subjects that interest the artist primarily deal with the means by which humans try to grasp their world, both visually and intellectually. The artist employs photography, video, and sculpture in order to compose a vision of what some have termed “troubling strangeness.” Overturning conventional codes of visual analysis, Grandmaison focuses on inanimate subjects that, once disassociated from their familiar environment, are re-contextualized through his cold gaze. His depictions do not exist as stories instead he reverses viewpoints and inverts color codes. His photographs and video works are generally black and white, giving them a monotone feel. A constant visual repetition in his work is his rigorously impersonal gaze. As a keen observer, he meticulously scrutinizes the world around him, analyzing it through the lens of a camera. Grandmaison is interested in the appearance of things and non-beings and, more rarely, of beings themselves. When human figures do appear in his work, they are presented in an inexpressive, impassive, distant way, equated to the role of an object.Pascal Grandmaison was born in Montreal, Canada, in 1975.",Solo,Americas,"['path.n.04', 'voice.n.01', 'fragment.n.01', 'scheme.n.01', 'entire.s.01', 'solo.n.01', 'set.n.01', 'repeat.n.01', 'sequence.n.01', 'expression.n.01', 'details.n.01', 'studio.n.01', 'individual.a.01', 'attention.n.01', 'shooting.n.01', 'gesture.n.01', 'narrative.s.01', 'position.n.03', 'camera.n.01', 'city.n.01', 'video.n.01']","['recording_studio.n.01', 'division.n.12', 'repetition.n.02', 'musicianship.n.01', 'detachment.n.02', 'scrutiny.n.02']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Grandmaison-Solo-stillsite.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Grandmaison-Solo-stillsite-300x169.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/solo/,"['Cultural/4.061988304093568', 'Individual_Personal/4.012698412698413', 'Material_Physical/3.504201680672269']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Material_Physical']",11.57888839746425,"['Time/3.504201680672269', 'Politics/2.4363636363636365', 'Body/2.4126984126984126']","['Time', 'Politics', 'Body']",8.353263729734318,"['Society/14.126928936216865', 'Cultural/11.961746749982044', 'Politics/11.368809278097206']","['Society', 'Cultural', 'Politics']",37.457484964296114,"['Politics/4.857142857142857', 'Time/4.301373626373627', 'Urbanization/3.623529411764706']","['Politics', 'Time', 'Urbanization']",12.782045895281188,0.3333333333333333,0.6666666666666666
Vidya Gastaldon,"Gastaldon has made a number of soft sculptures using materials associated with knitting and sewing that have alternately fetishistic, nightmarish or contemplative qualities. “Floating Mountain” is one of a group of works made from wool that overtly depict mountain forms. Suspended from the ceiling, the sculpture floats just above the floor. In the form of a mountain with a colored top, the sculpture recalls images of Mount Fuji, normally shrouded in snow, and memorialized in countless Japanese woodcuts. Mount Hemo, however, after which the work is named, was famously climbed by King Philip V of Macedonia, a feat that was alluded to by Petrarch in his own ascent of Mont Ventoux. Philip was a warrior king who fought the Romans and allied himself with Hannibal. The obvious link with the form of a mountain is complemented by the visual affinity of the work with a costume, possibly a bridal gown with its delicate filigree. The softness of the form and texture recalls the body. The presence of blood red suggests a carnal reading, the passage from innocence and virginity to knowledge and experience. The work thus unites landscape, sexuality and femininity within a single form whose delicacy and lightness suggests something dreamlike and ephemeral. The work is made via knitted yarn; has a makeshift feel in the sense of improvisation, although Gastaldon is an artist for whom craftsmanship is of great importance. Its craft also suggests the flow of liquid as one color bleeds into another. The linear construction of the object links it to the drawings that the artist makes of fantastical landscapes.","Vidya Gastaldon creates microcosms of hallucinatory, saccharine symbols with her sculptures, drawings, video animations, and prints. Working with mediums traditionally associated with feminine labor, such as knitting, sewing, and crocheting, Gastaldon continues the tradition of feminist trailblazers like Judy Chicago, Mary Kelly, and Rosemarie Trockel, but consciously avoids overt political statements. Eastern religion and new-age spirituality are dominant themes in Gastaldon’s work — especially the idea of transformation. In her sculptures, yarn and thread form mountainous cones and internal organs, while her drawings depict mystical creatures with exaggerated smiley faces that morph into fantastical landscapes. Gastaldon’s embrace of spirituality and psychedelia is genuine, but she also explores mankind’s darker side through her allusions to nuclear destruction and the pervasive imagery of mass marketing.Born in Besancon, Gastaldon lives and works in Geneva.",Floating Mountain (Mt Hemo),Europe,"['form.n.01', 'sculpture.n.01', 'landscape.n.01', 'soft.a.01', 'reading.n.01', 'japanese.a.01', 'ephemeral.s.01', 'passage.n.01', 'red.s.01', 'floor.n.01', 'construction.n.01', 'individual.a.01', 'quality.n.01', 'name.v.01', 'color.n.01', 'presence.n.01', 'sense.n.01', 'body.n.01', 'ocular.a.02', 'drawing.n.01', 'material.n.01']","['bodily.s.02', 'mountain.n.01', 'textile.a.01', 'gender_identity.n.01', 'blood.n.01', 'fabric.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Gastaldon.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Gastaldon-200x300.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/floating-mountain/,"['Cultural/6.384615384615384', 'Individual_Personal/4.36060606060606', 'Society/3.91025641025641']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Society']",14.655477855477855,"['Identity/4.36060606060606', 'Arts/2.5384615384615383', 'Economy/2.371794871794872']","['Identity', 'Arts', 'Economy']",9.27086247086247,"['Material_Physical/21.773393419446055', 'Cultural/11.410947712418302', 'Individual_Personal/8.43720462543992']","['Material_Physical', 'Cultural', 'Individual_Personal']",41.621545757304276,"['Arts/9.077614379084967', 'Materiality/6.781929181929182', 'Space/6.346153846153846']","['Arts', 'Materiality', 'Space']",22.205697407167996,0.6666666666666666,0.3333333333333333
Sergio De La Torre,"Nuevo Dragon City is a reenactment of a historical event from 1927 in which six Chinese were either trapped or voluntarily hid themselves inside a building in northern Mexico. Working with this unsettled mystery, De La Torre’s video inquires into the historical and continuing tensions between Chinese and Mexicans. As such, Nuevo Dragon City depicts a symbolic act of self-entrapment in which six untrained actors of Chinese descent silently blockade themselves inside in an empty Tijuana storefront. As they close off the outside world, their surroundings and actions become a powerful commentary on the social reality of immigrants.","Sergio De La Torre has worked with and documented the manifold ways in which citizens reinvent themselves in the city they inhabit, as well as the site-specific strategies they deploy to move “in and out modernity.”  De La Torre often collaborates with his subjects, resulting in both intimate and critical reflections on topics like housing, immigration, and labor.

Nao Bustamante,"Silver & Gold combines video, performance, and original costumes into a self-proclaimed “filmformance” that evokes the legendary filmmaker Jack Smith and his tribute to 1940s Dominican movie starlet Maria Montez in a magical and joyfully twisted exploration of race, glamour, sexuality, and the silver screen. Taking Smith’s interest in Hollywood’s obsession with the reproduction of the exotic as a point of departure, Bustamante embodies Miss Montez.

In the early 1990s he was known as a member of the art collective Los Carpinteros, which he left in 2003 in order to pursue his career as a solo artist.  Since then, his works have often explored the growing prominence of surveillance systems in contemporary society and the fragility, loss of privacy, and disempowerment that result from this obsession with control.

Tomoko Yoneda,"Yoneda’s Japanese House (2010) series of photographs depicts buildings constructed in Taiwan during the period of Japanese occupation, between 1895 and 1945. Yoneda focuses both on the original Japanese features of the houses and on details that have been altered since the end of the occupation. The yet-to-be acknowledged history of the occupation of Taiwan and other East Asian countries by Japan during World War II is subtly disclosed in these pictures. Instead of presenting monuments, the artist chooses to depict houses where the domestic lives of local Taiwanese are still unfolding today. The complexity of history is thus foregrounded by the overlapping of the everyday, the memory mixing with the remains. Former Residence of the Daughter of the Japanese Prime Minister, Kentaro Suzuki, Who Accepted the Potsdam Declaration and Full Surrender to the Allied Powers, Ending the Second World War, Qingtian Street, I depicts a dusty room with Japanese window frames but no views. Its title offers a biography of the original inhabitants and their historical role before the postwar Chinese Nationalist takeover. The wall behind the counter in Former House of General Wang Shu-ming, the Chief of Staff Under Chiang Kai-Shek, Cidong Street, I has been painted a deep red. The detailed title subtly suggests how local residents may have subsequently altered the home’s original paint colors to be more “Chinese.”","Photography is Tomoko Yoneda’s primary medium. Influenced by both journalism and archaeology, the London-based artist tries to minimize subjectivity in her work and keep her subjects as real and open as possible, leaving space for interpretation by the viewer. Often the sites she documents appears insignificant and nondescript, lacking any visual references that might trigger direct associations with historical events. Their lengthy titles, however, reveal the identities of the places by providing historical and political context. The haunted feeling generated by the emptiness of the locations evokes unsettled spirits of the past, and seems to invite a moment’s reflection.",Japanese House Series,Asia,"['japanese.a.01', 'house.n.01', 'world_war.n.01', 'original.s.01', 'change.v.01', 'local.a.01', 'war.n.01', 'street.n.01', 'title.n.01', 'history.n.01', 'red.n.01', 'paint.v.01', 'complexity.n.01', 'picture.v.02', 'time_period.n.01', 'state.n.04', 'paint.n.01', 'details.n.01', 'colors.n.01', 'construct.v.01', 'picture.n.01', 'historical.a.01', 'frame.n.01', 'everyday.s.01', 'memory.n.01']","['occupation.n.02', 'claustrophobia.n.01', 'memory.n.01', 'architecture.n.01', 'war.n.01', 'haunted.s.03']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/tomoko_yoneda_former_house_of_general_wang_shu-ming.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/tomoko_yoneda_former_house_of_general_wang_shu-ming-300x234.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/japanese-house-series/,"['Society/8.616711229946524', 'Cultural/6.729298642533936', 'Individual_Personal/3.3956043956043955']","['Society', 'Cultural', 'Individual_Personal']",18.741614268084856,"['War/3.625', 'Arts/2.6985294117647056', 'Mind/2.5384615384615383']","['War', 'Arts', 'Mind']",8.861990950226243,"['Society/16.163188445541387', 'Cultural/13.330279034690802', 'Individual_Personal/11.868093997505763']","['Society', 'Cultural', 'Individual_Personal']",41.36156147773795,"['Time/5.527272727272727', 'War/5.338235294117647', 'History/5.016783216783217']","['Time', 'War', 'History']",15.882291238173591,1.0,0.3333333333333333

Sun Xun,"Sun’s animated film 21 Ke (21 Grams) is based on the 1907 research by the American physician Dr. Duncan MacDougall who claimed the measured weight of the human soul to be twenty-one grams. Sun used this episode—which was not fully recognized by the scientific community—as a point of departure for his depiction of a dystopian world in which the narration of history and notion of time are interrupted. Because each frame was drawn by hand with crayon, it took Sun and his animation studio team a few years to complete this thirty-minute film of a surreal journey through mysterious cities, plagues of mosquitoes, broken statues, cawing ravens, waving flags, and flooded graveyards. Here, an ever-present man in a top hat makes obscure, cryptic references in scenarios that include the national anthem, factories belching soot into the threatening sky, and soaring planes dropping leaflets to earth. Rather than encouraging specific interpretations, 21 Ke is a visual commentary that asks essential questions of human existence: Who we are? What have we done? Where are we heading?","Sun Xun creates videos and animation films from his meticulous, highly detailed, and often monochromatic, hand drawings executed in ink, oil, and crayon. Drawing on the ideas of thinkers like Karl Marx, Theodor Adorno, and Max Horkheimer, Sun investigates revolution, existence, mythologies of society, the notion of time, and the construction and narration of history.

Kan Xuan,"In four-channel video Island, a series of objects such as nail clippers, hairbrush, toothpaste, and house decorations are displayed with close-up shoots. Images are rendered in a highly polished and aesthetic manner, creating poetic visual ?ows. In front of each object, however, lies a coin, ranging from 2 Yuan, to 1 Pound, to 1 Euro or 1 Dollar, silently revealing the material value of these household supplies. Underneath elegant surface there is a deep sense of critical irony, elaborating by the contradictory nature of the cheap plastic items and their sophistic visual interpretation. Kan poignantly and metaphorically comments on the economic and production structure of today’s global market. The most in?uential visual spectacles can be generated by the most basic elements in the everyday.","Experimenting with painting, photography, performance, and video installation, Kan Xuan explores the everyday from a very personal perspective. Though she graduated from the China Academy of Fine Art with rigorous training in oil painting, Kan quickly adopted video as her primary medium. From often ignored daily life experiences as points of departure, Kan creates a visual diary. Here, the camera amplifies mundane activities to reveal absurd and eerie details. For example, in Kan Xuan, Ai!, she calls and answers her own name among the crowd in subway station; in Eggs, she squeezes and breaks eggs with her hands, and in A Sunny Day two middle-aged men laugh and tickle each other in a public plaza. In other works Kan engages feminist discourse by situating herself in uncomfortable situations or exposing her body, such as standing naked on a public pedestal in A Happy Girl or allowing spiders to crawl over her in Looking Looking Looking For!.",Island,Asia,"['ocular.a.02', 'object.n.01', 'material.s.01', 'render.v.01', 'plastic.n.01', 'market.n.01', 'island.n.01', 'global.s.01', 'economic.a.01', 'critical.a.01', 'production.n.01', 'poetic.a.01', 'aesthetic.a.01', 'interpretation.n.01', 'house.n.01', 'family.n.01', 'surface.n.01', 'structure.n.01', 'nature.n.01', 'sense.n.01', 'manner.n.01', 'elements.n.01', 'video.n.01', 'series.n.01']","['commodity.n.01', 'mass_production.n.01', 'domesticity.n.02', 'superficial.s.03', 'spectacle.n.02', 'aesthetics.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/xuan_kan_island_2006-2009.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/xuan_kan_island_2006-2009-100x300.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/island/,"['Cultural/24.16847350276144', 'Society/16.418329039381675', 'Individual_Personal/6.104511278195488']","['Cultural', 'Society', 'Individual_Personal']",46.69131382033861,"['Arts/10.58346129274922', 'Economy/8.418714618714619', 'Media/4.070604395604395']","['Arts', 'Economy', 'Media']",23.072780307068232,"['Cultural/33.607961646196955', 'Society/21.306501831501834', 'Individual_Personal/14.873044602456371']","['Cultural', 'Society', 'Individual_Personal']",69.78750808015516,"['Arts/13.05777849601379', 'Economy/7.312820512820513', 'Media/6.426373626373627']","['Arts', 'Economy', 'Media']",26.79697263520793,1.0,1.0

William E. Jones,"In Restaurant, Canton, Ohio (2011), a convenience store offers food, liquor, and Coca Cola to an empty street. A series of boarded-up storefronts marred by peeling paint conveys a sense of the pre- or post-apocalyptic—the hush just before or after a disaster. The reds, pinks, and oranges of the buildings give off warmth, but the absence of human activity makes the glow eerie and strange. Once a booming steel town, Canton is now struggling, and many of its buildings have been neglected for decades.

William E. Jones,"In the early 20th century, the Hercules Engine Company was doing a brisk business producing customized, heavy-duty engines. Seventy years later, when the United States military started opting for Humvees and stock parts, the company began to fail, and it entirely ceased production in 1999.

Roy Emerson Stryker, the then director of the program, was in charge of what he called “killing” negatives by punching holes in them to render them unusable. Killed continues Jones’s use of discarded film footage seen in his video created from vintage 1970s and 1980s gay porn that was included in the 2008 Whitney Biennial.

It consists of three small paintings: one of a man with a head of multicolored fragments (I Am a Human), one of an abstract rainbow-colored geometric form on foil (Abstract Foil), and one of what appears to be a brightly burning star or a representation of the Big Bang (No Humans IV). In a playful but serious manner, it envisions the evolution of the world and the creative forces at play in nature and humankind.","The prolific Chris Johanson produces paintings, zines, installations, and sculptures that are notable for their earnest, almost childlike abstraction.

Abraham Cruzvillegas,"Wright Imperial Hotel (2004) is a sort of bow and arrow made out of feathers, a São Paulo phone book, and other materials. The title is a reference to a building Frank Lloyd Wright designed for Tokyo, which was completed in 1923. In its heyday, which lasted until after World War II, the hotel was reserved for elite personnel, many of them foreigners. With the passage of time it came to be seen as outdated and dingy, and it was demolished in the 1960s. Cruzvillegas’s work ironically and humorously symbolizes the hotel imposing presence. He presents us with the ultimate symbol of democracy—a phonebook—pierced with arrows.

Fran Herndon,"Working independently, Herndon experimented at the forefront of a now-canonical method—appropriation—by painting additions into found images from magazines such as Life and Sports Illustrated in a way that imbues the resulting works with mythical significance. Associated with the Beat movement, her work is integral to that part of the history of San Francisco. White Angel (1962), painted in the year of Marilyn Monroe’s death, portrays the actress in a process of devolution. Pictured upright in Vogue at the top-right of the frame, she sinks in stages to its lower left, increasingly engulfed by encroaching layers of paint and paper. Beneath fiery, scribbled, gestural marks and surrounded by foreboding, masked figures, her famous, partially obscured smile looks like a grimace.","Fran Herndon was born in Oklahoma in 1929, then moved to San Francisco in 1957, where she came into contact with Jack Spicer, who encouraged her painting practice by motivating her to study at the California School of Fine Arts (now the San Francisco Art Institute).  They collaborated on a few important poetry works including Homage to Creeley Heads of the Town Up to the Aether and J magazine.

Karl Haendel,"Haendel’s series Knights (2011) is a set of impeccably drafted, nine-foot-tall pencil drawings depicting full suits of armor.

Rendered in soft graphite, the imposing Knights embody the ostensibly conflicting ideals of chivalrous deference and invulnerable masculinity.","An expert draftsman well versed in semiotics, Karl Haendel strategically manipulates tangled visual, material, and textual themes, often to humorous and evocative effect.

Unlike the traditional vanishing point, the rays here emanate from the surface’s middle and hover around an indefinite and impossible convergence.

The work also suggests the shimmer and movement of the insect’s wings around an inconsequential and difficult-to-see body.","Mark Grotjahn’s paintings and drawings are light-hearted takes on geometric abstraction.  Many of his works use his “butterfly model” of skewed perspectival lines. These images conjure both infinite transcendence and the graphic design of book covers or psychedelic posters.

Carlos Garaicoa,"From the series the Old and the New (XI) by Carlos Garaicoa belongs to the series Lo viejo y lo nuevo / Das Alte und das Neue (The Old and the New) which was first exhibited in 2010 at Barbara Gross Gallery in Germany. Here, Garaicoa’s interest in vernacular Cuban architecture shifts towards the European context: a series of twelve nineteenth-century French engravings have been reworked into delicate paper models. Here, the two-dimensional old-school architectural renderings have become the foundation for new hollow three-dimensional structures. Reminiscent of pop-up storybooks, the small-scale paper forms have also been augmented with black paper shapes, which both resemble the images in a shadow theater and recall abstract modernist forms.","Like many other Latin American artists in the Kadist Collection, Cuban-born Carlos Garaicoa’s conceptual works look at architecture as a palpable indicator of the region’s socio-political and cultural histories. Working since the early 1990s in a wide range of media that includes sculpture, drawing, video, and photography, Garaicoa explores architectural forms and urban landscape aiming to reveal the multiple facets of the modern project’s failure in the Latin American context.

Rodney Graham,"Basement Camera Shop circa 1937 (2011) is part of a series of photographic self-portraits in which Rodney Graham plays a host of characters. In the series as a whole, Graham makes the case that identity is performed. Here, we see the artist behind a shop desk lined with early cameras and boxes of Kodak film. As the buttoned-up clerk scrawls a note, the ragged upper edge of the stage set is clearly visible above him. The scene’s self-referential, transparent artifice insists that photography itself is also about performance, and that the medium’s potential to generate vivid fictions might be more interesting than its historical role as a supposed conveyor of objective reality.","Conceptual artist Rodney Graham’s oeuvre is highly versatile and intellectual. By incorporating fictional narratives and alternative interpretations into an existing context, Graham creates visual puns that layer historical reference to examine social and philosophical systems.

Tina Modotti,"The Italian photographer Tina Modotti is known for her documentation of the mural movement in Mexico. She had a keen eye for architectural composition, and captured eloquent details using a delicate platinum print process. In 1929 she was deported from Mexico because of her involvement in the Communist party and went to Europe. Soon thereafter her work began to blend her eye for space and shape with a more critical social angle, often engaging in an overtly anti-Fascist discourses. Untitled (Cathedral) (ca. 1930), taken after her arrival in Europe, is an excellent example of her skillfully composed architectural pictures. It evokes ideas about how the composition of public spaces can influence both politics and cultural life.","Tina Modotti was an Italian film actress and photographer. As a photographer, she collaborated with Edward Weston and extensively documented the Mexican mural movement. In addition to her photography of Diego Rivera’s murals, she is also depicted in five of them. Modotti was involved in both the artistic and political avant-gardes of Mexico City, befriending members of and eventually joining the Mexican Communist party. Political repression forced her to move back to Europe, and she eventually lived in Moscow before moving to Spain when the Civil war began in 1936.

Rodney Graham,"Ponderosa Pine IV belongs to a series of large-scale photographs of trees taken by Graham and depicts a particular species that live in Northern California. The photograph is framed upside down; these “inverted trees” follow Graham’s early experiments with the camera lucida, a room-sized pinhole camera that dates back to ancient times and which he has used to photograph trees from various regions. Through these works Graham looks back at the history of photography while making the viewers aware of their own retinal experience.

Barry McGee,"Barry McGee’s Untitled is a collection of roughly fifty, framed photographs, paintings, and text pieces clustered together in corner. Its tiled effect can perhaps be seen as a vertical Carl Andre work and also bears some resemblance to another work in the Kadist Collection, Jedediah Caesar’s JCA-25-SC. McGee’s installation also echoes the votive altars in the chapels he visited during his residency in Brazil in 1993.

Maayan Amir & Ruti Sela,"In Beyond Guilt the two artists create a portrait of our generation in three parts. In Tel Aviv, in confined spaces such as toilets or bar of hotel rooms, they create situations in which participants answer questions and describe themselves. Camera in hand, there is little editing in their works, leaving a rather crude result. The camera becomes the witness of exchange between the participants and the artists in a relationship of power and seduction. These people could easily have counterparts in Western societies. Yet, what is ultimately disturbing is the contradiction between a very light form of life turned to pleasure, sex, or transgression and violence. One in which we perceive the trauma of a permanent war, a conflict sometimes assumed and claimed.","Maayan Amir and Ruti Sela, two young Israeli women artists work collaboratively or individually by project. Shot in Tel Aviv, their short videos report contradictions of a society defined by power relations, commonly featuring subjects like artists and models, men and women, and the private and public domain. Their films offer a fresh examination of the influence of occupation, terror, and the army in Israeli identity. Even in the most private moments, sexual identity and political identity are inextricably linked in their works. For their latest project “Exterritory,” the two artists left their cameras in distinct locations to collectively investigate space beyond borders in different neighboring countries at war. This utopian project exists only in a temporary situation, a place located in transit across the maritime horizons. There, Maayan Amir and Ruti Sela, other artists and curators, met to develop a film program centering on the concept of extraterritoriality. The first program “Exterritory” was held June 17 to 21, 2010, (coincidentally a few days after the Israeli attack of the fleet on its way to Gaza) on a ship that traveled from Israel to Cyprus.

Saâdane Afif,,"Saâdane Afif practices the quote: “I belong to a generation of artists who {…} discuss art as a form of language, with which you play upon, you deform, you transform, without focusing on the object as it was before.” Such strategies of re-appropriation insert themselves inside a context of idea circulation, as a form of remixing and remaking. In the work “Pirates Who’s Who,” tactics of assemblage are recognizable on all levels. The artist makes use of an eccentric shelf by designer Ron Arad, displaying dripping paint on the wall while the shelf itself holds a collection of books on piracy, compiled together by the owner of the work. “Power chords” (2005), perhaps the most ambitious project by the artist to date, is both a work for publication and several exhibitions. The installation depicts automatic electric guitars, playing scores orchestrated by a computer program. The chords are defined by color sequences derived from André Cadere’s wooden segments. Yet with Afif’s displacement, the artist hints to the color and rhythmic sound dimensions vis-à-vis Cadere, inside a genre of synesthesia. In an age of numerical technology, Cadere’s rhythmic system echoes in a particular manner together with the processes of digitization. Afif suggests a principle of encoding the world underlying the real, or rhythmic language before the Tower of Babel. Saâdane Afif was born in 1970 in Vendome, France.

Jonas Staal,"Jonas Staal’s installation is based on the thesis written by Fleur Agema and titled “Closed Architecture”. The paper, written by the second most important person of Geert Wilderds’ Freedom Party, concerns an ambitious model for a new prison that focuses on the reconditioning of prisoners by means of four phases. Staal’s work is developed through a book, a plan and a 3d virtual tour in the social imagery of a current minister of the State of the Netherlands. Through this meticulous work by the artist the perspectives on political and architectural planning of a new right wing populist class of politicians is revealed and exposed through an analytic display.  As Jonas Staal points out: “This change in society requires more prisons since the entire society has become a model of detention: everyone is trapped in their own social conditions, whether poor or rich. Within the the debate on the representation of society and the society of control the work of Agema should be considered as a case study compared to the possibility of an open and democratic society, in which the interest common and political emancipation take center stage.”  For Staal, this model can be considered an ideological model in relation to how the Dutch society is now developing, with poor suburbs and gated communities under surveillance.","Jonas Staal ‘s work includes interventions in public spaces, exhibitions, lectures and publications. He interprets democracy – democratism – as a Gesamtkunstwerk (total work of art) from a Beuysian perspective.  Jonas Staal was born in 1981 in Holland.

Goldin+Senneby,"In this installation, you are standing at the heart of a bicephalous space reflecting Goldin+Senneby’s main research led during their residency in Paris. Here, two historical events from the late 1930’s and early 50’s are confronted.  In one of these spaces, you find yourself reading a map of the Marly forest where Georges Bataille’s secret society, « Acéphale », was meeting around 1937 and notably celebrating Louis XVI’s regicide.  A few years later, Georges Bataille wrote La Part maudite (1949). In this essay on economy, he describes a society of abundance and eternal excess where in return potlatch techniques and sacrifice were necessary forms of luxurious consumption.  Nearly at the same time, in the early 1950’s at the very beginning of the Cold War, you are witnessing the emergence of Eurodollar, when Soviet and Chinese banks deposited dollars in Europe, in Paris at the BCEN (EUROBANK), known today as VTB Bank. Thus, the Dollar escaped the US financial, territorial jurisdiction and the very nature of money changed from a symbolic value to  a virtual one. Money entered a new space of exteriority, beyond the control of the sovereign state.  Money was decapitated.  These are facts. Facts that are deeply entangled in a fictional narrative entitled Looking for Headless,  commissioned by artist duo Goldin+Senneby since 2007. In this detective story, involving a murder (by decapitation again), the narrator travels to the Bahamas looking for the offshore company called ‘Headless Ltd’. Looking for Headless is published as a ghost written serial novel based on raw material sent by the artists correspondences, dossiers, tapes – and by the different artistic presentations of the project since 2007 in the form of conferences, lectures, videos or exhibitions.  At the Kadist Art Foundation, Goldin+Senneby underline a tenuous but precise speculation: Is the emergence of the Eurodollar and the later offshore finance the exact void where money disappeared, performing a contemporary radical consumption announced by Bataille in La Part maudite?

Amie Siegel,"Berlin Remake (2005) combines extracts of East German films with images filmed by the artist in Berlin. While staying in Berlin, the artist found the locations where the official films were made and she juxtaposes the two in a synchronised double projection. Therefore on one screen there is Berlin between 1945 and 1989 and on the other Berlin in 2004. The contrast between the two is troubling, strange and uncanny (Freud would say unheimlich). History in both continuous and ruptured. It is as if the artist was remaking these films but without the actors, or the plot; in a way it is a meditation on absence as well as a demonstration of the changes in Berlin. She also uses an extract of the last film to be shot under the Communist regime. The scene occurs in a place that has been entirely reconstructed since. At the beginning, the film itself looks like a remake of an old East German film but during the projection it transpires more like a comparison rather than a reconstruction. The film is simultaneously a search for lost time and for recaptured time.","Amie Siegel works with the cinematic image—the precise production of filmic and still images—to produce artworks that address deeper social issues. She fakes and remakes, to purposefully tell lies as a vehicle to a greater truth. Through researching and implicitly critiquing the history of film, Seigel makes use of genre tropes, such as those found in science fiction, noir and the western. She also has a keen interest in politics, critical theory and a marked distrust of  capitalism.",Berlin Remake,Americas,"['berlin.n.01', 'movie.n.01', 'projection.n.01', 'time.n.01', 'search.n.01', 'reconstruction.n.01', 'government.n.01', 'film.v.01', 'strange.a.01', 'actor.n.01', 'location.n.01', 'shoot.v.01', 'lose.v.01', 'contrast.n.01', 'screen.n.01', 'scene.n.01', 'history.n.01']","['transformation.n.05', 'reshoot.v.01', 'east_germany.n.01', 'perturb.v.01', 'comparison.n.02', 'communism.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/img-777.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/img-777-300x225.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/berlin-remake/,"['Material_Physical/3.4948830409356724', 'Politics/3.317460317460317', 'Society/2.496732026143791']","['Material_Physical', 'Politics', 'Society']",9.309075384539781,"['Land/2.6198830409356724', 'Politics/1.7619047619047619', 'Economy/1.7189542483660132']","['Land', 'Politics', 'Economy']",6.100742051206447,"['Society/15.859890109890113', 'Material_Physical/15.703718503718509', 'Cultural/14.00689865689866']","['Society', 'Material_Physical', 'Cultural']",45.57050727050728,"['Land/5.507692307692308', 'History/5.1499999999999995', 'Arts/5.026373626373626']","['Land', 'History', 'Arts']",15.684065934065934,0.6666666666666666,0.3333333333333333
Christoph Keller,"Message to the Extraterrestrials consists of a slide projector beaming images into the side of the telescope. These are then reflected down to a mirror at the bottom of the telescope and from there to a mirror on the ceiling. From the ceiling the images bounce down to a mirror at floor level which projects the images through an open window to the world outside. The function of the telescope has been inverted and transformed from a receiver to a broadcaster of light. The images it projects are selected from the ‘Golden Record’ produced for the Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 missions. These were intended to inform any extraterrestrials of life and culture on earth. Described by Ann Druyan, author and science media producer, as ‘a classic message in a bottle’ there was never any knowing whether, if viewed by an extraterrestrial, they would be able to decode the visual signals or not. The projection of these images by the Voyager spacecraft was at once an informative and a futile gesture. Ed Stone, Voyager’s project scientist, stated that “In a sense it is a unifying message. It’s a message from Earth. It contains greetings in many languages, music from many cultures and images that portray our home planet.”","Christoph Keller’s works function between science and art and have a practical as well as an aesthetic application. They are interventions into reality as well as inventions. Keller is fascinated by previous scientific undertakings such as Wilhelm Reich’s Cloudbuster project that Keller re-enacted from the roof of PS1 in an attempt to make rain over New York in the Spring and Summer of 2003 using orgone and nuclear energy. Keller’s stance is at once social political and artistic. He is engaged in debates around existence and the human condition. His project Helioflex is an attempt, using mirrors, to ‘bypass the social gradient of access to sunlight in urban habitations’, in other words to bring sunlight to areas normally in shadow at an affordable price. According to Keller the density of building generates a social gradient of sunlight in urban areas. The top floors bathe in light that is missing in the bottom floors. The device bypasses this gradient and creates a connection to the outside world by reflecting natural light to spaces that have never seen the sun before.’ Keller’s political engagement is in the tradition of Josef Beuys, who taught at the Free University in Berlin where Keller began to study physics in 1988. Christoph Keller is a German artist who studied math, physics and hydrology before studying liberal arts in Berlin. Christoph Keller was born in  Fribourg, Germany, in 1967.

Cao Fei,"Diversionist is part of the Cosplayers Series from 2004. In Cosplayers Cao Fei depicts the popularity among Asian youths of “cosplay” in which daily life is merged with images of video games and popular films. For many, this virtual reality is an outlet to “transcend” the paradox of a developing society in which the pleasures of consumption and depression of alienation go hand-in-hand. Cao Fei sensitively captures the new social consciousness and activism, beautifully translating them into photographic and video works.","Cao Fei is a celebrated multimedia artist known for works that focus on the interplay between real and fictional worlds. Working across photography, performance, video, and digital media, her practice vividly reflects the zeitgeist of the late twentieth century and the role that image production has played in shaping youth culture in a digital era. Influenced by an array of forms of global pop culture—from Cantonese Pop and Japanese anime to American hip-hop—a common thread in her practice is the merging of everyday life with new forms of technology as a means to unveil society’s unfulfilled desires.  Her pivotal film Whose Utopia, for example, showcases assembly line workers in a factory in China as they act out their aspirations in a backdrop of industrial machinery. In another key body of work, RMB City, Fei created a virtual city through the platform Second Life—an online space that mimics ‘the real world’—as a vehicle to express ideas that relate to modernization, capitalism, and consumer culture. Through these constructed worlds, Fei presents a profound meditation on the boundaries between the real and the fantastic and the sense of alienation that drives new generations to increasingly experience the world behind the veneer of their Avatars. For Fei, the digital world is an expression of our human condition, and as such, an avenue to reflect on these emerging forms of social consciousness.",Diversionist,Asia,"['virtual.s.01', 'daily.s.01 life.n.01', 'consciousness.n.01', 'daily.s.01', 'popular.a.01', 'game.n.01', 'society.n.01', 'photographic.a.01', 'world.n.03', 'social.a.01', 'life.n.01', 'movie.n.01', 'series.n.01', 'image.n.01']","['experience.v.03', 'fictional_character.n.01', 'act.v.03', 'consumption.n.03', 'activism.n.01', 'alienation.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/cao_fei_diversionist.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/cao_fei_diversionist-300x225.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/diversionist/,"['Individual_Personal/9.420563097033686', 'Cultural/3.2540849673202614', 'Politics/1.0']","['Individual_Personal', 'Cultural', 'Politics']",13.674648064353947,"['Emotion/6.217948717948718', 'Fantasy/2.4763071895424837', 'Mind/1.6470588235294117']","['Emotion', 'Fantasy', 'Mind']",10.341314731020613,"['Cultural/23.937423687423692', 'Individual_Personal/13.970480499892266', 'Society/10.237362637362638']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Society']",48.14526682467859,"['Media/11.069291819291822', 'Culture/6.2725274725274724', 'Mind/4.87524240465417']","['Media', 'Culture', 'Mind']",22.217061696473465,0.6666666666666666,0.3333333333333333
Lu Chunsheng,"A mesmerizing experience of a vaguely familiar yet remote world, History of Chemistry I follows a group of men as they wander from somewhere beyond the edge of the sea through a vast landscape to an abandoned steel factory. Using long shots and atypical settings, Lu Chunsheng enigmatically refers to a distant history while conveying the sense of dislocation wrought by successive stages of modernization. The combination of elaborate landscape shots from the suburbs of Shanghai and Lu’s signature style of spare and minimally crafted acting offers a surreal view of human behavior in spaces marked by the hulking remnants of China’s extraordinary development.","A particularly generative aspect of Lu Chunsheng’s work is the way it breaches the boundary between documentary and fiction. Rather than merely illustrate it, his conceptual and methodological coherence broadens and extends his inquiry into everyday life.

Bani Abidi,"The threshold in contemporary Pakistan between the security of private life and the increasingly violent and unpredictable public sphere is represented in Abidi’s 2009 series Karachi. These staged photographs were shot against the backdrop of the city’s empty streets at sundown during the holy month of Ramadan. During this time, Muslims fast and retreat indoors, leaving the city eerily empty. By portraying ordinary citizens from religious minorities, the photographs reclaim the occupation of public space. Domestic gestures are brought forward and presented in the streets. By being so specific about the times and locations where they were shot, Abidi tests the political potentials of these everyday gestures.  In Karachi Series I (Ken DeSouza, 7:42pm, 25th August 2008, Ramadan, Karachi) (2009), a man in a white shirt polishes his shoes without further revealing anything else about his identity. Presented in lightboxes, the pictures’ backlit luminosity exaggerates their absurdity and strangeness.","Bani Abidi’s practice deals heavily with political and cultural relations between India and Pakistan; she has a personal interest in this, as she lives and works in both New Delhi and Karachi.

Hamra Abbas,"At first glance, Cityscapes (2010) seems to be a collection of panoramic photographs of the city of Istanbul—the kind that are found on postcards in souvenir shops. A closer examination, however, reveals that a key element—the minaret—has been systematically removed, thereby changing profoundly the history and religious character of the city. The work is a response to a November 2009 referendum in Switzerland that approved a ban on the construction of new minarets in that country. It was also a crucial time in Turkey’s negotiation for entrance into the European Union. Instead of making a direct, didactic comment on the controversy, however, Abbas offers up a clever question regarding how landmarks are interpreted in vastly different ways depending on their cultural context. In the Western imagination, minarets are political symbols as much as they are religious architecture. In the Muslim world, they serve as mnemonic devices that enable residents to recognize their own city.","Hamra Abbas, who lives and works in Boston and Islamabad, Pakistan, makes work that has a profound connection to her own cultural context. She asks probing questions about the everyday and its complex relationship with history and ideology; her subject matter ranges from religious rituals to war and the sexual iconography of the Kama Sutra. Working with a diverse range of materials and media, Abbas frequently intertwines the contemporary with the classic to offer up a critique of both modern Western and Islamic cultures.","Cityscapes 1 (boats), 2 (woods)",Middle East & Africa,"['religious.s.01', 'city.n.01', 'remove.v.01', 'symbol.n.01', 'imagination.n.01', 'shop.n.01', 'direct.a.01', 'state.n.04', 'construction.n.01', 'architecture.n.01', 'cardinal.s.01', 'cultural.a.01', 'context.n.01', 'political.a.01', 'question.n.01', 'fictional_character.n.01', 'history.n.01', 'time.n.01', 'photograph.n.01']","['erasure.n.02', 'symbol.n.02', 'minaret.n.01', 'religious.n.01', 'european_union.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/hamra_abbas_cityscapes_i_boats.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/hamra_abbas_cityscapes_i_boats-300x66.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/cityscapes-1-boats-2-woods/,"['Material_Physical/1.675', 'Individual_Personal/1.6235294117647059', 'Society/1.6']","['Material_Physical', 'Individual_Personal', 'Society']",4.898529411764706,"['Mind/1.6235294117647059', 'Land/0.875', 'History/0.8']","['Mind', 'Land', 'History']",3.298529411764706,"['Cultural/17.950980392156865', 'Material_Physical/10.138023723782238', 'Individual_Personal/9.16628959276018']","['Cultural', 'Material_Physical', 'Individual_Personal']",37.255293708699284,"['Arts/8.308169934640523', 'Fantasy/5.284640522875817', 'Land/5.22483660130719']","['Arts', 'Fantasy', 'Land']",18.81764705882353,0.6666666666666666,0.3333333333333333
Mario Ybarra Jr.,"Ammo Bunker (2009) is a multipart installation that includes large-scale wall prints and an architectural model. The work takes as its departure point the history of Wilmington, Ybarra’s native hometown in southern Los Angeles. The piece refers to a Civil War era ammunition store that Ybarra found at the heart of the harbor close to Long Beach. The facility was later used as a temporary prison to hold different people coming from Mexico to Los Angeles during the Civil War. The building’s walls are covered with different marks and inscriptions from that time—what Ybarra likes to call L.A.’s earliest graffiti and which today coexist with recent gang tags. By pointing out the presence of these two kinds of inscriptions in the same historical place, Ybarra furthers his investigation into the intertwining of Mexican-American and Anglo-American social and cultural histories in Southern California.","Mario Ybarra Jr. belongs to a generation of Mexican-American artists who embrace their double heritage and use it in order to create critical and compelling artistic work. Ybarra is based in Los Angeles, where he grew up, and a large part of his artistic practice has grown out of issues related to his upbringing in the Chicano community of Wilmington. He consistently explores the culture and politics of the West Coast to produce, as he says, contemporary art that is filtered through a Mexican-American experience. Ybarra is not only a multifaceted artist, but also works as an educator, gallerist, activist, and social anthropologist.",Ammo Bunker,Americas,"['los_angeles.n.01', 'war.n.01', 'wall.n.01', 'history.n.01', 'prison.n.01', 'probe.n.01', 'print.n.01', 'keep.v.01', 'kind.n.01', 'era.n.01', 'beach.n.01', 'shop.n.01', 'mexico.n.01', 'california.n.01', 'architectural.a.01', 'model.n.01', 'historical.a.01', 'presence.n.01', 'cultural.a.01', 'building.n.01', 'people.n.01', 'social.a.01', 'piece.n.01']","['monument.n.02', 'inscription.n.01', 'chicano.n.01', 'graffito.n.01', 'detention.n.01', 'los_angeles.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/mario_ybarra_jr_ammo_bunker_2009_1_of_3.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/mario_ybarra_jr_ammo_bunker_2009_1_of_3-300x202.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/ammo-bunker/,"['Cultural/8.917582417582418', 'Society/5.31674538911381', 'Material_Physical/3.1483157365510306']","['Cultural', 'Society', 'Material_Physical']",17.38264354324726,"['Urbanization/2.672514619883041', 'Design/2.571428571428571', 'Arts/2.435897435897436']","['Urbanization', 'Design', 'Arts']",7.679840627209048,"['Society/22.95326736387108', 'Material_Physical/14.167435488488122', 'Individual_Personal/12.047511312217196']","['Society', 'Material_Physical', 'Individual_Personal']",49.1682141645764,"['Urbanization/7.454443801812223', 'Land/7.419883040935671', 'History/5.204761904761904']","['Urbanization', 'Land', 'History']",20.0790887475098,0.6666666666666666,0.3333333333333333
Natasha Wheat,"Natasha Wheat’s Kerosene Triptych (2011) is composed of three images, one each from the digital files of the Library of Congress, the Smithsonian Institution, and the Field Museum tropical research archive. The original photographs were taken by anonymous photographers, not as art but as documents of the building of the Panama Canal.  The laborers in the images are holding cans of kerosene and spraying it into the foliage. It was a common practice during the building of the canal for American companies and the military to import black workers from the Antilles Islands to spray kerosene to kill mosquitoes and prevent malaria. This practice resulted in massive health problems for the laborers and the disappearance of many species of local wildlife—not just insects but also plants and animals. With this work, Wheat uncovers and generates a space where the movement of objects (the movement of objects being the function of the Panama Canal) takes priority over life, art, and society itself. The coming together of the three images into a single work stands as abstract documentation of sterilization—both cultural and biological.","Natasha Wheat’s diverse body of work explores social experience as a sensual phenomenon that is riddled with hierarchical complexity. Her objects, installations, and interventions engender and disrupt a full range of interpersonal relations. Wheat was the founder of Project Grow, an art studio and urban farming program based in Portland, Oregon, that employed developmentally disabled adults and investigated the intersection of food, ideology, society, and exchange. She earned her BFA from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago and an MFA with an emphasis in social practice from California College of the Arts.",Kerosene Triptych,Americas,"['practice.n.01', 'motion.n.03', 'building.n.01', 'object.n.01', 'tropical.s.01', 'company.n.01', 'field.n.01', 'digital.a.01', 'institution.n.01', 'documentation.n.01', 'local.a.01', 'animal.n.01', 'island.n.01', 'military.a.01', 'image.n.01', 'function.n.01', 'common.a.01', 'document.n.01', 'individual.a.01', 'american.a.01', 'photographer.n.01', 'museum.n.01', 'compose.v.01', 'abstract.a.01', 'original.s.01']","['documentation.n.01', 'pesticide.n.01', 'laborer.n.01', 'commodity.n.01', 'archive.n.01', 'industrialization.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/nataha_wheat_kerosene_triptych.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/nataha_wheat_kerosene_triptych-300x102.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/kerosene-triptych/,"['Society/10.297435897435898', 'Cultural/7.950091575091575', 'Material_Physical/2.466666666666667']","['Society', 'Cultural', 'Material_Physical']",20.71419413919414,"['Economy/7.758974358974358', 'Arts/3.228937728937729', 'Design/2.307692307692308']","['Economy', 'Arts', 'Design']",13.295604395604395,"['Society/23.223635351576537', 'Cultural/22.403199741435046', 'Individual_Personal/15.06593406593407']","['Society', 'Cultural', 'Individual_Personal']",60.69276915894565,"['Spirituality/6.8175824175824165', 'Culture/6.806501831501832', 'Arts/6.777564102564103']","['Spirituality', 'Culture', 'Arts']",20.40164835164835,0.6666666666666666,0.3333333333333333
Ian Wallace,"Untitled (Breathless) presents a folded newspaper article on Jean-Luc Godard’s À Bout de Souffle (Breathless). The work uses collage techniques—it is stapled down and has a thick strip of contact sheet paper taped over it—that convert the media coverage on Godard’s film into a filmic object itself. The black paper enacts a kind of cinematic “jump cut” on the article, while simultaneously drawing attention to the medium of the film, as well as the photograph reproduced in this newspaper article. The composition has a casual and dynamic stylishness to it (as do the movie stars lying in bed), which is contradicted somewhat by the static utilitarian aesthetic of the piece’s construction. The tape and staples hold the more dominant visual elements in place and recall printmaking tools.","British-born and Vancouver-based, Ian Wallace is known for his conceptual art practice and critical writings.

Jeff Wall,"As suggested by its title, Pipe Opening (2002) depicts a hole in a wood wall exposed by the removal of a pipe. In contrast to his signature immense tableaux, Pipe Opening is a direct but modest document of a “real” scene that Wall “encountered by chance” in daily life. However factual, the image indicates certain enigmatic significance, allowing multiple interpretations. Wall encourages the viewer to engage with the scenario to imagine the before and the after of the moment. Compared to his earlier work, Wall’s photographs appear to be straight-up snapshots, exhibiting less manipulative details. The fictional details are not conveyed through obvious arrangements but due to the very nature of photographs: What they record is always an incomplete view of the world.","Internationally renowned photoconceptualist Jeff Wall is famous for his large-format lightboxes whose subject matter ranges from figurative portraiture to urban environment to mundane objects to elaborately constructed scenes.

Pascal Shirley,"Gypsy shows an ambivalent scene, in which broken blinds and its unsmiling subject are balanced with the stilllife plentitude of watermelon slices and the beautifully lit nudity of the sitter.

John Wood & Paul Harrison,"Board has a deadpan quality worthy of Buster Keaton.

The artists elaborate an orchestration of  the comic consequences of inertia, gravity, and the law of falling bodies in this low-tech physics experiment. Their mix of Conceptual art and slapstick conveys a sense of inspired pranksterism. Board (1993)  is one of the very first works they made in collaboration.","John Wood and Paul Harrison have been working collaboratively since 1993 producing single screen and installation based video works.Their work investigates the relationship between the human figure and architecture, developed through short form video  with particular emphasis on actions being formulated and resolved within a given duration.Wood and Harrison have exhibited extensively in France and the USA. Their works form part of the collections of the Tate, Centre Pompidou and MOMA. Their artistic practice spans the use of the frame, minimal aesthetics, associations of everyday objects and low-tech visual tricks, the making of micro-trivial actions – whose results are invariably between obvious failure and random success.

Ulla von Brandenburg,"Eight opens with a close up of a painting by Hubert Robert of the Chateau de Chamarande where the film was shot. This work  acts as a key to the unfolding film. In Eight, the camera tracks back and forth, proceeding from room to room, closing in on each motif, lingering and then passing on without ‘comment’, as a surrogate for the spectator’s gaze. Each tableau vivant that the camera/viewer encounters recalls some other cultural manifestation: Greek theatre in the mask, Magritte perhaps in the woman with no face, Caspar David Friedrich in the woman gazing out of the window, Greuze in the death scene observed by spectators (but also perhaps 19 century medical demonstrations to students) etc. Many of these motifs recur in von Brandenburg’s work so there is also a sense of self-reference. The film enshrines ambiguity; are these people alive or dead, animate or inanimate wax works? Only the paper that inflates and deflates indicates a living presence. This is the only motif that engages with the cinematic. Everything else is photographic and theatrical. Just as the film is destined to loop eternally (evoked by the moebius strip) so the figures seem to be frozen forever in their poses. However, part of the disquiet occurs in the gap between what we know and what we don’t know. Once the camera has passed do the figures come to life? Before the camera reaches them are they animate? The spectator is caught between worlds, between the conscious and the unconscious, the knowing and not knowing, in a timeless world staged for his inspection.",Ulla von Brandenburg was born in 1974 in Karlsruhe.

Anri Sala,"Ghost Games, follows the enigmatic dance of crabs “steered” by a flashlight in the night of darkness of a South American beach. The video produces a surreal impression, typical of Sala’s work, with no plot in the classical sense, no story being told. Like in Blindfold (2002), in which a sunrise is reflected in urban billboards, and Time After Time (2001), in which the figure of a horse emerges from darkness lit by the headlights of an automobile, Sala likes to explore the phenomenon of light and its effects; In Ghost Games, he uses the threatening reflection of the flash light through the darkness of the beach. But unlike several of Sala’s videos’ deliberately slow style, where sometimes the camera does not even move at all, this film is punctuated by the erratic moves of the monster-like creature , its ghostly disappearances into sand holes; the crab’s occasional encounters with the feet of unidentified people standing in the sand, at times like an aggressive dance of protagonists, dramatically adds to the creepy feeling of the scene.","Anri Sala received a degree in painting from the Academy of Fine Arts in that city, and went on to study at the Ecole Nationale Supérieure des Arts Décoratifs in Paris and at the Le Fresnoy, Studio National des Arts Contemporains in Tourcoing (film and video). His work has been exhibited at the Venice Biennale, the Berlin Biennale, the Manifesta 3 in Ljubljana and in numerous solo and group exhibitions. He combines techniques from two realms of art, the moving image and painting. His captivating visual projects on the one hand constitute a penetrating analysis of culture and the human condition as determined by place and political context, and on the other an exploration of the language of imagery, codes of visual communication and structures of film narration. Many of his projects relate to the identity of individuals who function at the fringes of multiple cultures.  Anri Sala was born in 1974 in Tirana, Albania.

Deliberately, he chooses painting as an instrument to create an oscillation between photo realism and free imagination. But in spite of being formally restrained, Rogalski’s paintings tell multilayered stories that draw the viewer in to the narrative.  Zbigniew Rogalski wa born in 1974 in Dabrowa Bialostocka, Poland.

Paul McCarthy,"Memory Mistake of the Eldridge Cleaver Pants was created for the show Paul McCarthy’s Low Life Slow Life Part 1, held at California College of the Arts’s Wattis Institute in 2008 and curated by McCarthy himself. In homage to an influence in his early career, McCarthy attempted to reconstruct a pair of pants worn by Black Panther revolutionary Eldridge Cleaver in a picture that appeared in Rolling Stone magazine in the 1970s. But in the process, McCarthy misremembered their original design of the pants, which had black outer panels and white inner panels in white, and left a black shape highlighted in the crotch area. Instead, McCarthy’s reconstruction divides the pants vertically in two black and white sections. McCarthy’s mistake speaks not only of the fallibility of memory but of a certain kind of queerness that resists any categorical—“black or white”—definition. Memory Mistake’s use of aesthetic formalism, error, subjectivity, and social history can be seen to challenge the tropes of modernism and art history.","Known for his transgressive performance art pieces that often challenge social conventions, Paul McCarthy is undoubtedly one of the main figures in the West Coast contemporary art scene. Using different forms from pop culture as source material, McCarthy casts a critical look at American society and consumerism.

McCarthy’s early work was largely associated with collective practices, graffiti art, and San Francisco’s active queer punk scene.

Matt Lipps,"Untitled (Women) (2011) presents a startlingly succinct history of violently romanticized femininity. Matt Lipps created this diptych by photographing a single arrangement of cutouts. As in his analogous portrait of men, the middle section appears twice, on either side of the split, signaling a stutter, a caesura, or a schizophrenic break. Within the cluster, fashion photography exists alongside frescoes, and demure piety butts up against unabashed sexuality. The women are bound not only by a fuchsia floodlight but also by a shared history. Western conceptions of beauty and eroticism are shown to sample widely and gluttonously, from tribal dance to a cowl-necked sweater.","Matt Lipps is a photographer whose strategies extend to include sculpture and installation. In his series Home (2008), jagged rocks and threatening ice floes impinge upon life-size domestic interiors. In a body of work entitled ‘70s (2004-2006), Lipps rephotographed 1970s male pornography, carefully lifting the models from their magazine pages, backing them with cardboard, and repositioning them amid contemporary, stage-lit bedspreads.

Matt Lipps,"In the series Horizons (2010), Lipps uses appropriation to riff on Modernism’s fascination with abstract form. For Untitled (Men) (2011), he snipped from magazines and textbooks pictures of handsome or famous men, from the ancient Greek to the modern. Arranged in a tableau, lit theatrically, and rephotographed, the two-dimensional figures have an embodied presence.

Tim Lee,"In the film Untitled (Buster Keaton, 1897) (2010), we see Tim Lee fall down a flight of stairs, referencing a pivotal story from Buster Keaton’s life: At the age of 18 months, he rolled down a flight of stairs, casually shrugged it off, and was then and there christened with the nickname “Buster” by Harry Houdini. Lee’s film is spliced together from multiple takes of him actually rolling his way up a staircase.

Given one minute to seize the voice of authority, contestants were asked to be the finger-pointing Uncle Sam, and their performances—as on the TV program American Idol—were voted on by a live audience.

George Kuchar,"Burrito Bay is a video by George Kuchar that follows the format of a diary or travelogue centered on a tropical trip to Acapulco, Mexico. The footage was filmed during the production of another film, Tropical Vulture, which was a cross-generational collaborative project between George Kuchar and his then student, Mexican artist Miguel Calderón. The video strays away from the conventions of documentary: Kuchar adds an array of effects such as fadeouts in between scenes, overlaid digital shapes, and an even a soundtrack. These effects, together with the lack of a cohesive narrative, give Burrito Bay a dream-like, surreal quality that is commonplace in his work.  Whether through scenes of roadside urinating, the group lounging in the poolside, preparing breakfast or staying indoors on a rainy day, Burrito Bay gives us a glimpse into Kuchar himself and the inner workings of his mind.","George Kuchar was a key figure in experimental and independent filmmaking in the Bay Area and more broadly across America. He gained prominence through his Super 8 and 16mm films produced throughout the 50s, 60s and 70s. Some of his most well-known titles such as Hold Me While I’m Naked (1966) giving him international recognition and legendary status in underground cinema.  In the 1980s, after more than three decades of working with film, Kuchar transitioned to video and subsequently created hundreds of low-fi, diaristic videos that oscillated between real life and fiction. Many of these camcorder pieces featured Kuchar or his friends as actors, and he also regularly collaborated his students from the San Francisco Art Institute.  Throughout his very prolific output of over 350 films, Kuchar was known for pushing the limits of film and cinematic tradition, creating his own distinct visual language. Using strange humor and joyously nonsensical across his films that featured UFOs, weather, defecating, urinating, forbidden passions—Kuchar embedded his eccentric videos with himself, often at his most intimate and profound.",Burrito Bay,Americas,"['bay.n.01', 'george.n.01', 'effects.n.01', 'scene.n.01', 'day.n.01', 'tropical.s.01', 'trip.n.01', 'phantasmagoric.s.01', 'footage.n.01', 'digital.a.01', 'format.n.01', 'film.v.01', 'documentary.n.01', 'video.n.01', 'mexico.n.01', 'production.n.01', 'quality.n.01', 'shape.n.01', 'undertaking.n.01', 'narrative.n.01', 'movie.n.01']","['remains.n.01', 'malfunction.n.01', 'diary.n.01', 'loss.n.03', 'surfboard.v.01', 'travel.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/george_kuchar_burrito_bay.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/george_kuchar_burrito_bay-300x221.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/burrito-bay/,"['Cultural/6.354700854700854', 'Politics/3.3087719298245615', 'Material_Physical/3.2706043956043955']","['Cultural', 'Politics', 'Material_Physical']",12.934077180129812,"['Language/3.0854700854700856', 'Geopolitics/2.508771929824561', 'Arts/1.6666666666666667']","['Language', 'Geopolitics', 'Arts']",7.260908681961314,"['Cultural/20.482979438861793', 'Politics/14.953235653235657', 'Material_Physical/12.675005696058328']","['Cultural', 'Politics', 'Material_Physical']",48.11122078815578,"['Media/6.5440673705379595', 'Arts/6.024692954104719', 'Land/5.850652271704903']","['Media', 'Arts', 'Land']",18.41941259634758,1.0,0.3333333333333333
Desiree Holman,"Reborn, 2010 is a three-channel video by Desiree Holman that questions ideas of motherhood and the maternal instinct. The video features a group of women as they tenderly cradle lifelike baby dolls atop their rocking chairs. Although at first, the video might appear as a celebration of the maternal bond, the scene soon becomes eerie and unsettling as we see milk spilling out of the mothers’ mouths. Subsequently, the tone changes dramatically as a group of women in their underwear wearing colorful, bedazzled niqabs, perform an upbeat choreography with the dolls strapped around their bodies.  The work is based on Holman’s research into the curious subculture of ‘reborners,’ a group of women known for hand-making, collecting and caring for hyper-realistic baby dolls called ‘reborns.’ Grounded in fantasy, the vernacular surrounding these dolls often addresses them as living. Fascinated by this, the dolls we see in Hollman’s video were created by the artist in a process that lasted over a year, which involved rooting each individual hair and painstakingly modeling their skin tones.  Reborn is emblematic of Holman’s practice, which, through an anthropologic eye, aims at finding the fissures in established cultural tropes. As per other works by the artist, Reborn disrupts idyllic representations and conventions to bring to the fore the darker, strange and unsettling undertones of human nature.","Combining research, performance, video, digital manipulation, drawing, and installation, Desiree Holman’s multifaceted practice dissects the discourses that structure our shared experience of the social world: from ideas of gender and sexuality to notions of race and motherhood among many others.  Originally trained as a sculptor, the Oakland-based artist places emphasis on objects due to their potential as repositories of meaning. With the help of performers, she then puts these objects to use as costumes or props in performances that the artist describes as “identity play-focused work.” Although Holman generally presents the performances as multi-channel videos, her oeuvre also incorporates traditional gallery works such as drawings and paintings, which a related to the videos on display.  The source material informing her work is often based in her real-world research, pulling apart and interrogating social constructs she finds in popular culture and subcultures, in order to excavate social myths and illustrate the complexity of human psyche.",Reborn,Americas,"['woman.n.01', 'video.n.01', 'hair.n.01', 'mother.n.01', 'perform.v.01', 'life.n.02', 'fantasy.n.01', 'bring.v.01', 'eye.n.01', 'strange.a.01', 'individual.a.01', 'name.v.01', 'representation.n.01', 'practice.n.01', 'nature.n.01', 'establish.v.08', 'body.n.01', 'cultural.a.01', 'question.n.01', 'human.a.01', 'procedure.n.01', 'idea.n.01', 'make.v.03', 'scene.n.01']","['maternal.a.01', 'illusion.n.02', 'lifelike.s.02', 'feminism.n.01', 'sex.n.04', 'doll.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/desiree_holman_reborn.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/desiree_holman_reborn-300x200.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/reborn/,"['Individual_Personal/11.012815126050421', 'Cultural/2.4162895927601813', 'Politics/0.875']","['Individual_Personal', 'Cultural', 'Politics']",14.304104718810603,"['Mind/4.13781512605042', 'Values/2.4000000000000004', 'Body/1.875']","['Mind', 'Values', 'Body']",8.41281512605042,"['Individual_Personal/42.46812109459169', 'Cultural/32.37215578539109', 'Society/19.896448322918918']","['Individual_Personal', 'Cultural', 'Society']",94.7367252029017,"['Culture/14.168772893772893', 'Mind/13.324358974358974', 'Spirituality/11.238267614738202']","['Culture', 'Mind', 'Spirituality']",38.731399482870074,0.6666666666666666,0.3333333333333333

Ana Teresa Fernandez,"The artist writes about her work Borrando la Frontera, a performance done at Tijuana/San Diego border: “I visually erased the train rails that serve as a divider between the US and Mexico. I painted them sky blue, creating a “Hole in the Wall” This deconstruction of “feminized” work explores the difficulties in reconciling both low wages and undervalued work via social and political infrastructures, confronting issues of labor and power. The images that I myself perform, present a duality: women dressed in a black tango dance attire while engaging in de-skilled domestic chores; the surreal within non-fiction. The work underscores the intersection of everyday tasks and fantasy.

Felipe Dulzaides,"I Am Cuba—“Soy Cuba” in Spanish; “Ya Kuba” in Russian—is a Soviet/Cuban film produced in 1964 by director Mikhail Kalatozov at Mosfilm. The movie was not well received by the Russian or Cuban public and was almost completely forgotten until its rediscovery thirty years later by American filmmakers. The movie’s acrobatic tracking shots and idiosyncratic mise-en-scène prompted Hollywood directors like Martin Scorsese to campaign to restore the movie in the early 1990s. In 2006, Dulzaides traveled to Cuba to remake a small part of the film which became Scene I Am Cuba, a two-fold narrative in which one story line is based on a real event, and the other is the process of turning evidence into the theatrical.","Felipe Dulzaides studied drama at the Instituto Superior de Arte of Havana and received a MFA in New Genres from the San Francisco Art Institute. A poetic and metaphoric sensibility underlies his practice, which ranges from single-channel videos to video installations and documentaries.  Some of his works begin with actions executed for the camera; others use autobiographical experiences to illustrate the emotional stress of cultural displacement or to reveal memory as an unstable process of endless revision. Dulzaides oscillates between his American and Cuban identities, and he views his bicultural background as a bridge. He has received prestigious awards from the Cintas Fellowship, Creative Work Fund, Art Matters, and the Rome Prize among others and his work has been included in biennials, museums, contemporary galleries and art centers around the world.",Scene I am Cuba,Unspecified,"['movie.n.01', 'narrative.n.01', 'martin.n.01', 'hollywood.n.01', 'evidence.n.01', 'produce.v.01', 'american.a.01', 'shooting.n.01', 'event.n.01', 'public.a.01', 'real.a.01', 'establish.v.08', 'procedure.n.01', 'scene.n.01']","['recreate.v.04', 'cuba.n.01', 'parallel.s.02', 'appropriation.n.03', 'reenactment.n.01', 'violence.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/felipe_dulzaides_scene_i_am.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/felipe_dulzaides_scene_i_am-300x225.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/scene-i-am-cuba/,"['Cultural/9.690090611143244', 'Society/9.138443256090316', 'Material_Physical/4.37124183006536']","['Cultural', 'Society', 'Material_Physical']",23.199775697298918,"['Arts/4.7897243107769425', 'Land/3.5712418300653597', 'Urbanization/3.1790849673202617']","['Arts', 'Land', 'Urbanization']",11.540051108162565,"['Cultural/18.485220335220337', 'Society/13.086691086691092', 'Individual_Personal/7.460317460317459']","['Cultural', 'Society', 'Individual_Personal']",39.03222888222889,"['Media/5.984920634920634', 'Arts/4.257142857142857', 'Spirituality/4.146031746031746']","['Media', 'Arts', 'Spirituality']",14.388095238095236,0.6666666666666666,0.3333333333333333

Hans Peter Feldmann,"The types of objects Feldmann is interested in collecting into serial photographic grids or artist’s books are often also found in three dimensional installations. Verging on a form of fetichism, his shoe collections are a case in point and indeed, for some exhibitions, he even asked gallery employees for their shoes. Against authorship and the commodification of art, he never gives titles or dates to his works which have infinite edition possibilities.  The mode of display is paired down to the simplest form of a plain square plinth that nevertheless conveys artistry. The presentation contributes to the re-orientation and re-contextualization of these assembled found objects taken from everyday life. This work, like hat with photo and teapot with shadow also in the collection, could be imagined as a form suggestive of portraiture. Secondary autobiographical components are sometimes included: a set of eight black-and-white photographs of shoes, Ursula + Hans-Peter, stands for the artist and his wife with whom he worked in a gift store when he left the art world in the 1980s.

Martin Creed,"This photograph of Martin Creed himself was used as the invitation card for a fundraising auction of works on paper at Christie’s South Kensington in support of Camden Arts Centre’s first year in a refurbished building in 2005. His broad smile, on the verge of laughter, encourages reciprocity on behalf of the onlooker. This could be said to be a typical tactic in Creed’s work as it is so infused with humor and irony. To him, art is like a game, or certainly very much a part of banal reality. Within the genre of self-portraits, this subverts the usual tradition of images of the artist as creator. Creed often jokes or questions whether the artwork (or in this case the persona of the artist) has any value or exists. Standing in front of a very British brick wall which likely carries art historical connections and puns, Creed seems to mock or certainly stand amazed at his own commercial success. In 2001, he won the Turner Prize with his controversial Work No. 227. The Lights Going on and off.  “I want to make things. I’m not sure why, but I think it’s got something to do with other people. I think I want to try to communicate with other people, because I want to say ‘hullo’, because I want to express myself, and because I want to be loved”.","Martin Creed is a sculptor, filmmaker, performer and installation artist. Working within a minimal or conceptual mode, most of his artworks, objects, statements, suggestions or performances are titled “Work” and numbered. He wittily subverts the definitions of art and often uses mundane modest materials such as Blu-Tack, balloons, tape, piles of paper. In 1993, Work No. 81 consisted of a one-inch cube of masking tape in the middle of every wall in a London firm and since 1998 Work No. 200 proposes “the air in a given space” through filling it with balloons. Yet any anti-materialism is occasionally counteracted like in the marble staircase realized for the city of Edinburgh or the bronze sculptures.

"Jennifer Allora, Guillermo Calzadilla","This installation combines the display of real objects with the deceptively painterly  amalgamation of their content as the subject of a photograph. Here Allora & Calzadilla condemn the worldwide threat of violence caused by the high desirability of oil and water. Caught in the light, the patterning of the two liquids in the print creates attractive rainbow-like pools, a distanced comment on pollution. This trace on the ground is an aestheticized piece of evidence of a real heavily loaded problem for nature and society. The artist’s critical stance is poetically and precisely rendered to encourage debate about politics, power and ecology through art.  Pure, life-enhancing natural resources are presented as potentially explosive substances in metal or plastic containers. Such absurdity is made visible in the direct dialogue of cause and effect in this presentation which is then amplified by the title, The Nature of Conflict, which adds to the imagination of extended dangerousness. Allora & Calzadilla have created a meaningful and at the same time subtle visual formula for the summary of their alarmed analysis of a current global issue.","Jennifer Allora and Guillermo Calzadilla comprise the artistic duo Allora & Calzadilla. Their work often takes the form of performances, installations, and sound pieces that refer to sociopolitical phenomena and history.

"Jennifer Allora, Guillermo Calzadilla","This series of photographs is part of the body of work Allora & Calzadilla made regarding the situation in Vieques, an island off the mainland of Puerto Rico used for the 60 years by the U.S Military and NATO forces to practice military bombing exercises. In 2000, they began a collaboration with the local activists to make the campaign more visible. Having added cast rubber reliefs of their slogans and designs to the soles of their shoes, the activists stamped their protest on the reclaimed land. By slightly manipulating everyday objects to become communication tools, Allora & Calzadilla had created “mobile print-making machines” (Yates McKee, October 133, Summer 2010). They then photographed the ephemeral aftermath of these mark-making actions.  Like graffitied walls, the details of these impressions on sandy grounds are landscapes of dissent, willing the transition of propriety back to the inhabitants. In Land Mark #10, numerous footsteps with long statements stamp their resentment in different confused orientations. Such a beach scene might at first misleadingly be associated with a playful holiday snap. The fragility, uncertainty and relentlessness of this struggle is poetically summarized in this close-up of meaningful site-specific expression. The artists wrote: “How is land differentiated from other land by the way it is marked? Who decides what is worth preserving and what should be destroyed? What are the strategies for reclaiming marked land? How does one articulate an ethics and politics of land use?” (in Land Mark, de Tokyo, Paris, 2006).","Jennifer Allora and Guillermo Calzadilla comprise the artistic duo Allora & Calzadilla.

Xiaoyun CHEN,"In the video work Drag, a man in a dark room pulls on the end of a rope. In midst of sounds of heavy breathing, the camera presents alternating scenes of a man and the shadow of a man wearing a long, pointed hat cast against a wall. Insinuating a sinister mood, the man and the shadow struggle to control the scene through alternating tugs and releases of a rope. The shadow dominates. Later, a human voice murmuring in low, deep tones provides a soundtrack to the visual ambiguity to produce and effect between something derivative of Plato’s “Allegory of the Cave” and a mockery of human desire and struggle. The video ends with an epigram added by Chen: “You cannot, could not, be in the dark, about all the darkness”, an ominous warning of play on words seemingly urges the viewer to approach the incoherent narrative as a layered incantation of play on shadows.","Chen Xiaoyun studied ink painting at the Chinese Academy of Arts and lived as a writer in Suzhou before becoming part of the Hangzhou video art community. Chen’s works stages scenes of everyday life with elements of the strange and the absurd in order to explore existentialist themes through narratives of visual linearity.

Sheung-Chuen,"Pak created New York Public Library Projects (NYPLP) (2008) during a residency in New York, using public libraries as exhibition spaces and the books they house as raw materials. One of the nine parts of this work is Page 22 (Half Folded Library), a site-specific installation for which Pak covertly folded dog-ears on page 22 of every second book (a total of approximately 15,500 books) in the 58th Street Branch Library in Manhattan. By claiming it as a “solo exhibition,” Pak intentionally turned a public institution into a private and personal museum where his works are more or less a “permanent collection.” Being open-ended as far as further interpretation (or not) by readers who encounter the folded pages, the project tests the political and social potential of personal gestures in the public realm. It is also an ironic commentary on the increasingly self-estranged yet narcissistic art world.","Pak Sheung Chuen’s practice might be described as immaterial, everyday, process-based, and collaborative. Pak’s projects usually start with a familiar but not necessarily acknowledged idea, then take it beyond a conceptual gesture without necessarily producing additional objects. Through repetition and anonymous intervention, the idea gradually starts to take form and infiltrates its surroundings, leaving subtle traces.

Ming Wong,"Making Chinatown (2012) is a remake of Roman Polanski’s 1974 classic neo-noir film Chinatown. According to Wong, the latter is a “textbook” of Hollywood filmmaking. In Ming’s version, he plays all four main characters portrayed originally by Jack Nicholson, Faye Dunaway, John Huston, and Belinda Palmer, shooting against a backdrop of a film set reproduced as wallpaper in a gallery space. Presented as a seven-channel video installation, Making Chinatown is an immersive viewing experience with different scenarios, lines of conversation, and background music, all merged together into one space where the sense of time collapses. The ending fades to black with no reference of the original film’s site, precisely echoing the fictional nature of Chinatown as a no-place, constructed in an often-detached cultural context.","Ming Wong’s practice has a profound connection with world cinema. Constantly drawing from classic films, Wong investigates issues around identity, linguistics, translation, dislocation, and history through reenactments of well-known films. Often using a deliberately low-budget aesthetic, he restages the films by appropriating and recontextualizing the main storylines and characters.

Haig Aivazian,"This work is part of an ongoing project that looks at international sports competitions as a revealing element of nationalistic aspirations which present contradictions.  The starting point of this work was inspired by private companies which were responsible for the security of the Olympic Games in England and also supply equipment for immigrant detention camps and prisons.  This work questions the use of the stadiums other than for sports competitions. Reference is clearly made to the Vélodrome d’Hiver or the detention camps during the Vichy regime under Pinochet or the Talibans but also their requisition during natural disasters like after hurricane Katrina in New Orleans. The lighting creates a frame that obstructs the stadium with a luminous mass in suspension, creating a strange apparition in the darkness and a mixed feeling, between violence and fascination. The title comes from a short poem written by the artist that alludes to separation and distance. These blinding lights replace the moon light. The charcoal is used to create a contrast with this idea of light. This is what remains when the light has been fully consumed and all that is left are ashes. This work is the sequel of a video that dealt with the three adolescents that were electrocuted in Clichy-sous-Bois in 2005 and the protests that followed with the burning of cars.","Haig Aivazian was born in 1980 in Beirut.

Edith DEKYNDT,"The raw materials used in Edith Dekyndt’s work are as intangible as the light, the wind, magnetic waves or the cold…  This artist has conceived works for many years, which she considers “neither spectacular, nor consumable”. She questions the relationship between the world of facts, science and experience on one hand and an eminently subjective approach to the world in what she calls a “universal search of subjectivity”.  Thus the immediate perception of objects that she submits to the spectators is questioned by the paradoxical simplicity of the natural phenomena that she records. The artist then develops an implicit critique of scientific objectivity and suggests that art is a field of knowledge on its own.  Edith Dekyndt looks at the waters of the Dead Sea, that become almost an abstract undersea landscape. The exceptional physical qualities of this salt water make this an unusual study: depth, weightlessness floating, where the presence of salt eradicates any possible life form. Edith Dekyndt films the emptiness and the supposed absence in this sea, in which we can, however, notice an immense richness of movements and colors due to light variations of light. In Dead Sea Drawings, the artist films the surface of the sea, under which she places a white sheet of paper. The shadows of the minerals present at the surface of the water create a random drawing, like an infinite variation of designs. She reminds the spectators that this sea and its coast have been witness to thousands of years of history, different religions and are still marked today by three distinct political entities. This work is part of a project called Lot’s wife (La Femme de Loth), which refers to a passage in the Book of Genesis in which the patriarch, Lot, and his family run away from Sodom and Gomorrah during the destruction of the two cities. Disobeying the Angel’s command not to look back, Lot’s wife turns into a salt statue. For this project the artist has made a series of drawings where the salt creates hollows in the paper, distorts it, damages it and in doing so, creates forms and designs.","Born in 1960, Ieper, BelgiumLives and works in Belgium",Dead Sea Drawing,Europe,"['sea.n.01', 'batch.n.02', 'variation.n.01', 'water.n.01', 'design.n.01', 'drawing.n.01', 'surface.n.01', 'paper.n.01', 'light.n.01', 'undertaking.n.01', 'spectator.n.01', 'form.n.01', 'tag.v.01', 'wave.n.01', 'record.n.01', 'phenomenon.n.01', 'percept.n.01', 'search.n.01', 'huge.s.01', 'field.n.01', 'destruction.n.01', 'approach.n.01', 'survey.n.01', 'passage.n.01', 'shadow.n.01']","['natural_phenomenon.n.01', 'light.n.01', 'dead_sea.n.01', 'subjectivity.n.01', 'intangible.n.01', 'salt.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/dead_sea_drawing.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/dead_sea_drawing-300x169.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/dead-sea-drawing/,"['Material_Physical/4.205128205128205', 'Society/1.6666666666666667', 'Individual_Personal/1.0']","['Material_Physical', 'Society', 'Individual_Personal']",6.871794871794872,"['Economy/1.6666666666666667', 'Environmental/1.6025641025641026', 'Physics/1.6025641025641026']","['Economy', 'Environmental', 'Physics']",4.871794871794872,"['Cultural/27.49090940019734', 'Society/25.0469887073636', 'Material_Physical/20.43834529763323']","['Cultural', 'Society', 'Material_Physical']",72.97624340519417,"['Arts/9.684213172448468', 'Time/8.36226567550097', 'Economy/7.259493284493284']","['Arts', 'Time', 'Economy']",25.305972132442722,0.6666666666666666,0.3333333333333333
Laure Prouvost,"In Stong Sory Vegetables, Laure Prouvost explains that she woke up one morning and that some vegetables had fallen from the sky on her bed, making a hole in her ceiling. Each video, in this series, is an odd still life representation turning everyday elements into imaginary and funny stories. A tomato, an onion, a lemon and a carrot are displayed in front of the monitor as relics. These vegetables are also present, outside the monitor, to assure the spectators as well that the stories we are hearing are true.  The artist invites us to participate in her stories, and to sort out the inextricable connections between language, image and perception. In many of her videos, Laure Prouvost uses as a starting point her own family life, her acquaintances or even her pets. Her daily stories drift quickly towards odd and funny connections. Thus, in the video Stong Sory, the artist prepares a beautiful cake for her brother’s birthday, which contains living surprises such as spiders and birds. The piece of bread on the stand is a relic, which brings us to see beyond its mere appearance. In the same way, if Laure Prouvost uses her family as “raw material” it is not only to create a contrast with her surreal stories but also to speak about the complexity of daily life as a constant invitation into her works: “Behind!

Loretta Fahrenholz,"Loretta Fahrenholz’s video is composed of a patchwork of sequences. She constructs her film by juxtaposing stylized takes of street dance performances or images of the disasters at Far Rockaway caused by hurricane Sandy.  A dancer goes back and forth in a corridor, a crooked silhouette contorts itself from anxiety on an unmade bed, bodies collapsed on the ground suddenly come to life, dancers, characterized by pixilated gestures, pretend to fight to the death. Their movements are robots-like: the machine man and the zombie only belong to fiction.  “Ditch Plains” strongly raises questions related to technology and man caught up in mediatized environments. The hip-hop music accentuates the resemblance with to a trashy horror movie.

Marc Nagtzaam,"Nagtzaam’s medium is drawing and his repertory of forms varies from abstract hard-edge and wall drawing to the reproduction of written material that he collects from art magazines. The artist uses abstract architectural elements that he reproduces on the wall in which he inserts drawings, elements from photographs and drawings of texts collected from art magazines. The repetition, control and imperfection of the movements create a tension, a particular vibration in his geometrical drawings and in the drawings of texts. The idea of repetition, of a copy, appears as an essential ritual element and a ritual in the artist’s work process. Despite a kind of austerity and the evocation of a minimal and conceptual aesthetic, a light goes through his composition giving his work an organic dimension. Exhibition walls, random perspectives and frontal hangings provoke a sort of dizziness and of virtual upheaval.  This work is composed of two wall drawings and three drawings on paper (a protocol allows the installation in different spaces). The artist’s idea is to merge different spaces together, to affirm their existence while denying it (confronting tangible and virtual space). The drawings hung in these spaces reproduces the traces of previous works, in memory of previous projects and past actions. The drawing made out of texts is a patchwork of fragments of sentences coming from Asian magazines. These fragments evoke a different place where the snippets of words complete and contradict each other, and seem to describe, explain as well as disappear. The architectural skeleton, its absence of density, suspends the time of physical experience. Wavering and steadiness are put to test in a strangely experienced period of time.","1968, Helmond, the Netherlands",Installation #1,Europe,"['drawing.n.01', 'magazine.n.01', 'virtual.s.01', 'fragment.n.01', 'repeat.n.01', 'architectural.a.01', 'wall.n.01', 'abstract.a.01', 'space.n.01', 'elements.n.01', 'idea.n.01', 'time.n.01', 'kind.n.01', 'dimension.n.01', 'conceptual.s.01', 'trace.n.01', 'write.v.01', 'time_period.n.01', 'component.n.01', 'tension.n.01', 'physical.a.01', 'composition.n.01', 'compose.v.01', 'action.n.01', 'motion.n.03']","['architecture.n.02', 'time.n.05', 'fragment.n.03', 'tension.n.03', 'abstraction.n.04', 'contradiction.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/MN_I_1.001.O.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/MN_I_1.001.O-300x200.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/installation-1/,"['Cultural/18.589456484348133', 'Material_Physical/8.011111111111111', 'Society/3.2040100250626566']","['Cultural', 'Material_Physical', 'Society']",29.804577620521904,"['Arts/9.52703818369453', 'Technology/4.083333333333333', 'Time/3.6666666666666665']","['Arts', 'Technology', 'Time']",17.277038183694533,"['Individual_Personal/28.522450098920697', 'Cultural/24.825572275498242', 'Politics/14.433383609854204']","['Individual_Personal', 'Cultural', 'Politics']",67.78140598427314,"['Mind/9.30769230769231', 'Values/8.499806076276665', 'Media/8.398248260167763']","['Mind', 'Values', 'Media']",26.205746644136738,0.3333333333333333,0.0
Rachel Rose,"A minute Ago starts with a hailstorm pelting down unexpectedly on a quiet beach in Siberia. People, half naked, run for cover under towels and parasols, to the music of the Pink Floyd.  The next scene is an interview of Philip Johnson, filmed 10 years before in the Glass House he constructed. Johnson was 90 years old then. At this point in the video there is a kind of digital sound that interrupts the high definition image, moving to the rhythm of a wood percussion musical composition by Steve Reich. The house, surrounded by an extraordinary landscape, is then bombarded by hail, the soundtrack becomes a live concert interrupted by the yelling and cheering of the public.  The painting Landscape with the funeral of Phocion by Poussin is the only image in the house. It shows a hearse going through fields to the burial place. The image duplicates itself with the deconstruction of the video image, the rain which pixelates the screen, the soundtrack which chops up this time space.","For artist Rachel Rose, the current moment is one of shifting terrain: as technology advances, the world changes beneath and around us, leaving us struggling to keep up. Rose is interested in the rapidly changing conditions we live in, and the ways that language, technology, and images mediate the out-of-sync realities of our organic lives.

Finally, the work includes an architectural model of the Carlton Hotel.","Marwa Arsanios is born in 1978 in Washington, United-States.Lives and works in Beyrouth, Lebanon.

Marwa Arsanios,"I’ve heard stories (2008) is one of Marwa Arsanios early works. It is a short animated film staging a story that took place at the Carlton hotel in Beirut. This work is the first part of a longer project on this iconic building.  In I’ve heard stories, Marwa Arsanios attempts to piece together rumors surrounding the now demolished Hotel Carlton. The hotel was a popular meeting place for gay men living in Beirut, Lebanon, where homosexual acts are considered illegal. At that time (1973 to 1993), the hotel was also the setting of three murders that might or might not have been related to these sexual encounters. Among the victim of these (probably) passionate crimes was the Lebanese politician and businessman Henri Pharaoun. Known as a collector and the richest man in Lebanon during most of his lifetime, Pharaoun was stabbed multiple times by an unknown assailant (his lover, driver or cook). Nora was the only witness to this murder. The nature of the murders went unreported. The animation explores different ways of narrating Arsanios’ reconstruction of the event through drawings and videos, gossip and facts, in an effort to give these crimes their place in the history of the city.","Marwa Arsanios is born in 1978 in Washington, United-States.Lives and works in Beyrouth, Lebanon.

Setareh Shahbazi,"Shahbazi’s early drawings in the series “Oh No…” are reminiscent of comic strips or children’s coloring books. Subjects are rendered graphically and set against flat solid colors. The origin of these drawings is a mix of her own collection of images and the Arab Image Foundation’s collection in Beirut, Lebanon. Shahbazi’s most recent work “Spectral Days” takes an introspective turn through a series of photomontages that are based on hundreds of roughly scanned family photographs. Creating spectral figures, Shahbazi delves into the loaded history of her family’s exile from Iran following the revolution. Like the rest of her work, which is built on the logic of free association, these images resist a literal or a linear reading while simultaneously speaking of and surpassing the context from which they were born. Shabazi’s solo presentations are often playful, her photographs of various sizes dialogue with contextual objects and architectural elements.",Setareh Shahbazi was born in Tehran in 1978 and moved to Germany in 1985 where she lives now.,Spectral Days,Middle East & Africa,"['family.n.01', 'drawing.n.01', 'size.n.01', 'amusing.s.02', 'render.v.01', 'reading.n.01', 'association.n.01', 'dialogue.n.01', 'solo.n.01', 'put.v.01', 'presentation.n.01', 'playful.a.01', 'architectural.a.01', 'image.n.01', 'series.n.01', 'child.n.01', 'photograph.n.01', 'colors.n.01', 'construct.v.01', 'beginning.n.04', 'book.n.01', 'establish.v.08', 'context.n.01', 'elements.n.01', 'figure.n.01']","['playful.a.01', 'snapshot.n.01', 'exile.n.03', 'nonlinear.a.01', 'personal.a.01', 'irreverent.a.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/soldance_63_45.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/soldance_63_45-218x300.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/spectral-days/,"['Cultural/3.2540849673202614', 'Politics/1.0']","['Cultural', 'Politics']",4.254084967320262,"['Design/1.5555555555555556', 'Geopolitics/1.0', 'Media/0.875']","['Design', 'Geopolitics', 'Media']",3.4305555555555554,"['Cultural/23.904132589490654', 'Individual_Personal/14.621733821733825', 'Society/11.509890109890112']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Society']",50.03575652111459,"['Media/6.769108669108668', 'Arts/5.822008547008547', 'Spirituality/5.595604395604395']","['Media', 'Arts', 'Spirituality']",18.18672161172161,0.4,0.3333333333333333
Patty Chang,"The video “Shangri-La” refers to the mythical city of James Hilton’s novel “Lost Horizon” written in 1933 and is exemplified in a film by Frank Capra which speaks of eternal youth in a city of happiness. In 1997, a small town in an agricultural region of central China near the Tibetan border was proclaimed as the place that inspired Shangri-la. Thereafter, a dozen other cities in the same area have claimed to be paradise on earth, prompting a marketing battle without mercy, raging on until the government’s intervention. The mirror used to build the model of the mountain is highly symbolic and often appears in the work of the artist. In literature and art, it represents the transition between reality and the dream world composed of projections and desires. Chang’s work focuses on the reality and fiction inherent in an existing space in both its concrete embodiment and its myth. She explores the idea of a real journey to an imaginary place. This work exposes contradictions: the search for a city’s roots and traditions leads to a falsification of its history, and cultural conflicts inside of touristic and financial goals.","When she arrived in New York in the mid 1990s, Patty Chang became involved in the performance scene. Staging her own body in intensely difficult situations enables her to denounce problems she observes in contemporary society such as various excessive behaviors like eating disorders, as well as the sex trade, gender and cultural stereotypes, identity issues. Soon, she also used video and photography (like the Contortion series 2000-2002) to document her actions and extend her practice. By appropriating cinematic conventions, popular culture, pornography, literature and translation, Chang ceaselessly explores and subverts historical and current relations between East and West.

Matthew Buckingham,"Matthew Buckingham presents a narrative directly connected with a highly symbolic site in the United States, the Mount Rushmore Memorial*. He elaborates a historiographic narrative of this place and switches it into the domain of science fiction by proposing a photograph of the Memorial as it should appear in 500 000 years. The effigies of Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln and Roosevelt become unrecognizable. In the texts, deployed in a chronological order, we learn, among other things, that the sculptor Gutzon Borglum was a member of the Ku Klux Klan.Buckingham tells real and fictional stories to test their validity and exemplarity in the present. The installation, featuring the image of the Memorial, can lead us to reflect on our role in writing new chapters of this history.     * The Memorial is located in South Dakota in the United States, it is an 18 meters high monumental granite sculpture initiated in 1925, representing four of the most significant presidents in American history.","Matthew Buckingham was born in 1963 in the United States of America. He has recently had solo exhibitions at the Art Institute of Chicago and at the Reina Sofia in Madrid. His critical approach reenacts real or fictional stories while interrogating their validity in order to clarify the present. He considers the construction of collective memory and individual memory. He asks how these memories can be diametrically opposed to the writing of History with a capital H dependent on the Modernist ideology of progress. Several of his works are linked to the exploration of the lives of significant individuals, such as important figureheads for Feminism. His work relates to the questions posed as a consequence of Cultural Studies in the 1970s, of Queer and Feminist theories as well as Postcolonial studies. In his articulation of reality and fiction, he is close to works which are already in the collection by Mario Garcia Torres or by Walid Raad.","The six grandfathers, Paha Sapa, in the year 502 002",Americas,"['narrative.n.01', 'history.n.01', 'reflect.v.01', 'south.n.01', 'symbolic.a.01', 'fictional.a.01', 'fiction.n.01', 'american.a.01', 'narrative.s.01', 'real.a.01', 'function.n.03', 'sculpture.n.01', 'photograph.n.01', 'image.n.01']","['erosion.n.01', 'rushmore.n.01', 'prefiguration.n.02', 'ethnography.n.01', 'context.n.01', 'sioux.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/img-692.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/img-692-217x300.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/the-six-grandfathers-paha-sapa-in-the-year-502-002/,"['Cultural/3.356390977443609', 'Individual_Personal/2.3927601809954755', 'Material_Physical/2.3238095238095235']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Material_Physical']",8.072960682248608,"['History/1.8181818181818181', 'Mind/1.6235294117647059', 'Language/1.561904761904762']","['History', 'Mind', 'Language']",5.0036159918512855,"['Cultural/22.915362905068793', 'Material_Physical/10.623132423132423', 'Individual_Personal/5.70552503052503']","['Cultural', 'Material_Physical', 'Individual_Personal']",39.244020358726246,"['Fantasy/8.200757575757576', 'Arts/7.356435394670688', 'Land/7.199755799755799']","['Fantasy', 'Arts', 'Land']",22.756948770184064,1.0,0.0
Elina Brotherus,"A subject’s back stands before a landscape of mountains, arid and majestic, Der Wanderer 3 revisits the theme of man versus nature dear to Romantic painting and the paintings of Caspar David Friedrich in particular. “From him I returned to the theme of the character turning their backs to the viewer. I love the back. The back is quiet, discreet, polite and distant. It does not challenge the viewer as the eye does, the viewer looks at the same landscape as the model, but they are not disturbed.” With the series “The New Painting” made between 2000 and 2004, Brotherus confronts the photographic medium to the codes of classical painting, its subjects and aesthetics, particularly those of the landscape and the use of the nude.","Elina Brotherus depicts, through her photographic work a portrait of the contemporary artist made during different artistic residencies. Frequently in her work, she is the main model. In the series of “Suites françaises”  (French suites) made during a residency of three months at the Musée Nicéphore Niepce at Chalon-sur-Saône in 1999, the artist questions her relation to a foreign language, showing the difficulty in naming things with “post it” stickies. From this work emerges a sense of autobiographical intimacy, of which the camera exists as an absent witness. The artist captures decisive emotional states: the skin texture of a dancer in rehersal, a fine arts model posing as a Degas nude, a state of mind before leaving…The theme of landscape links introspection and contemplation as revealed in her self-portaits. One thinks of Caspar David Friedrich who stressed in his paintings that art played a role as mediator between nature and man. When referring to her work  Brotherus has stated, “For me, photography is primarily a constructed image. I consider myself a “maker” of images, or perhaps as someone who finds images. Visual discovery is very important. The working process follows after in the lab.”Elina Brotherus was born in 1972 in Helsinki, Finland.

Olaf Breuning,"In the work We only move wehen something changes !!!, Olaf Breuning composes a portrait of posed antiglobalization protesters, each wearing clown noses, inside of a scene reminiscent of an event. Like in the work Easter Bunnies (2004) (photographs of the Moai of Easter Island with big ears and rabbit teeth supported by scaffolding) the artist introduces the outside frame into his photographic frame. The detail of the red noses, that punctuate the image, re-examine the photograph’s meaning by introducing the role of the absurd inside of contemporary global issues. At once critical and playful, Breuning doesn’t alienate his subjects. The young anti-globalization activists are not impaired. Instead, they are shot or snapped in a moment of confusion, which is equally shared by Olaf Breuning himself. The spelling mistake of ‘when’ creates a supplementary text of a subtext. “Wehen” in German signifies the act of floating in the wind and the pains of childbirth. A linguistic slip surprisingly in tune with the subject of the image, the photograph evokes youth’s generational gap torn between the uncertainties and desires of action.","Olaf Breuning’s photographs, videos, performances and installations play with codes of mass production with references to publicity, fashion and cinema and “high” and “low” art. Between fiction and reality, fairytales and triviality, nightmare and bad jokes, the artist immerses his viewers decidedly into a pop and kitsch culture which is constantly being revisited. His works, made up by quotations, collages, and sampling are highly built. Often hyper-aestheticized, they work as “script-machines” reminiscent of special effects from the film industry. The artist frequently holds up a distorting mirror to his viewer, posing several questions of critique and play.Olaf Breuning was born in 1970 in Schaffhausen, Switzerland.

Mohamed Bourouissa,"The film called Temps Mort (Dead Time or Time Out) presents an exchange of short video footage assembled into one final edit. Remotely driven footage of daily life in prison, the banality of a sink, of a plant or a plate of pasta are offtset against scenes of life outside, in the streets of Paris, a night of love or seascapes. The dialogue between the inmate and the artist occurs by text messages and captures this exceptional situation of exchange, sharing et perhaps dependence. As the tie between the two men develops, the confrontation between life inside and out of those walls intensifies. Like his previous work, it is interesting to compare this with the documentaries screened in the general media about violence in the suburbs or in prisons.","Mohamed Bourouissa studied at the Arts Décoratifs in Paris and then at the Fresnoy. He is interested in the way in which an image can be constructed in order to approach a situation or a political subject differently. For the photographic series Périphéries, Mohamed Bourouissa composes his images with reference to famous paintings and to Jeff Wall’s photographs. The ‘banlieue’ (suburbs) is staged as a conceptual and artistic object in situations that would normally be typical of photo-journalism.

Barbara Bloom,"In the 1980’s, while browsing Parisian fleamarkets, Barbara Bloom stumbled into an anonymous watercolor (dating to around 1960) in one of Paris’ fleamarkets, probably a study made by an interior designer for a bedroom. The artist found the image to be typically Parisian. The watercolor, framed under a mat made of cardboard, had color tests on its margin, elements that Bloom discovered when she raised it. These details caught her attention and inspired her to create the installation titled The Bedroom. The work presents several elements related to image: a reproduction of the study, a reproduction of another watercolor contained in the set, and a carpet showing the floor of the depicted room (a detail of the carpet under the bed, and a shadow of the chair represented), as well as dabs of paint also present on the edges of the study. The two prints are hung on the wall, painted in light yellow, like the color of the walls in the study. On the floor, the carpet adds a final touch to the domestic aspect of the installation, also existing as a quasi-abstract expressionist painting. The installation plays upon different levels – the perspective effect on the carpet, aquarelle tests from the margin of the study, as well as “real” elements, each becoming decorative patterns for the piece at large.","Collector Barbara Bloom mixes autobiographical details, fictional narratives, and literary quotes. She arranges images and objects, and at the same time she makes transparent fetishitic qualitites which bind her to her objects and installations. The series entitled “Broken Objects” (2001) features celadon-colored porcelain broken by the artist then “repaired” with gold, according to an ancient Japanese technique. Fractures in the porcelain reveal the object’s fragility and imperfection. Like a precious scar, the porcelain’s fracture tells it’s story. The artist compares herself to a detective who unleashes meaning inside of small details. Bloom belongs to the generation of post-modern artists such as Cindy Shermann, Barbara Kruger, Richard Prince, etc. who analyze visual culture and expose its underlying ideologies. Although her practice is conceptual, it is based on objects that she likes or intrigue her. Through her decorative arrangements she refers to museography and the history of museums (the use of vitrines, wall text, name placards, lighting, etc.) and the way the eye operates inside of this context. Her interest in the question of perception is not only related to the visible and its limits, but also to representation, with particular regard to women’s place in history, which explains why she plays with sentimentality, femininity and elegance in some of her objects. Bloom was Jason Dodge’s professor with whom she shares a sense of metonymy: anecdotes of universal dimensions, the object as a trace, as well as memory and vanity.Barbara Bloom was born in 1951 in Los Angeles.

ATLAS GROUP / Walid Raad,"This image is an extract from a notebook in the archives of doctor Fakhouri that lists the cars that have been used for bombs between 1975 and 1991. Each page of the notebook contains a collage of an image of a car with the same make, model and color as the exploded car with a text in Arabic that gives the details of the place, time and date of the explosion, the number of people in the accident, the perimeter of destruction, the weight and the type of explosive. The images of the cars made visible are only equivalents since the cars that actually exploded are totally destroyed. Doctor Fakhouri made reconstitutions while the information collected in the media itself is subject to interpretation. The composition of these images in space is another distancing from the real fact. It is a little known fact that Lebanese historians were also gamblers during the war. They met every Sunday at the race courses. Race after race, the historians were positioned behind the press photographers who were there to take a picture of the winning horse passing the finishing line. The historians betted on how many fractions of seconds before or after passing the line the photograph would be taken. That is to say that no photo showed the horse on the finishing line. Each page of the notebook contains an image of the horse passing the finish line cut out of the Annahar newspaper on the following day. It features the annotations of doctor Fakhouri on the length and duration of the race, on the winning horse and his timing, his average speed, the initials of the different historians and their bets, the time between the snapshot and the passage of the finishing line, a very brief description of the winning historian (here the linguist). These documents provoke questions about historical fact. Why are there no images of the precise moment when the horse passes the finishing line? Does the press authorize the reproduction of false information? Conscious of the impossibility of capturing the exact moment, the historians bet not on the horses but on the photographer’s margin of error. The evidence about an event is not necessarily linked to the production of an objective document. There can be no certain objectivity with photographic material.","The Atlas Group is a project established in Beirut in 1999 to research and document the contemporary history of Lebanon.

Carey Young,"Report of the Legal Subcommittee is a print featuring a map of the stars, together with a found transcription of a recent United Nations meeting in which various international delegations declare frustration with their 40-year-old, ongoing efforts to devise a legal definition of outer space. This admission seems to hold a rich poetic potential, the human attempts to bureaucratize and control outer space seemingly frustrated by the sublime scale and mystery of its infinite depths.","Carey Young’s (b. Lusaka, Zambia, 1970) practice centers on the ethics of business and legal practice, motivated from having spent her early professional career in this context, to question society and politics. Young parodies and analyses the corporate business and legal world to expose its influence on contemporary society. The subject of law —that which is central to the structure of the international community — is a subject rarely explored in the contemporary art milieu. In exploring law as an artistic medium to address questions of the sublime and the void, Young traverses themes of the autonomous body, law and fiction and the power of law on society to highlight the danger of corporate influence in the institute and autonomous thinking.",Report from the legal subcommittee,Europe,"['attempt.n.01', 'keep.v.01', 'space.n.01', 'map.n.01', 'star.n.01', 'potential.n.01', 'poetic.a.01', 'scale.n.01', 'human.a.01']","['outer_space.n.01', 'constellation.n.02', 'systematize.v.01', 'capitalism.n.01', 'frustration.n.01', 'futility.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/cy-43-prt.jpeg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/cy-43-prt-239x300.jpeg,https://kadist.org/work/report-from-the-legal-subcommittee/,"['Material_Physical/9.684615384615386', 'Society/1.8333333333333335', 'Individual_Personal/0.8333333333333334']","['Material_Physical', 'Society', 'Individual_Personal']",12.351282051282054,"['Space/8.146153846153846', 'Economy/1.8333333333333335', 'Body/0.8333333333333334']","['Space', 'Economy', 'Body']",10.812820512820513,"['Material_Physical/12.05079365079365', 'Cultural/10.708139409609998', 'Society/7.2835164835164825']","['Material_Physical', 'Cultural', 'Society']",30.04244954392013,"['Space/8.712332112332112', 'Spirituality/4.026373626373626', 'Arts/3.2750000000000004']","['Space', 'Spirituality', 'Arts']",16.013705738705738,0.6666666666666666,0.3333333333333333
Leung Chi Wo and Wong Sara,"Photojournalist with Two Cameras restages a portrait of a photojournalist from the background of an old photograph of protest published in South China Morning Post on January 10, 2010 under the headline “Return of the Radicals: Recent angry protests are nothing new.” The photojournalist in the photograph, probably from a protest of earlier decades, was capturing the scene of a protester’s arrest while wearing two cameras. January of 2010 was a time of pro-Democracy demonstrators called for the release of activist Liu Xiaobo, drafter of the Charter 08 manifesto calling for the end of authoritarian rule, was sentenced to 11 years in prison one month earlier. Leung’s isolating and highlighting of the photographer by bringing him from the original photograph’s background to the foreground of his studio shot calls attention to the two older cameras and the journalist’s retro-style clothing. This focus brings forth the multiplicity of gazes present in photojournalism and its implications for free speech and freedom of press across the geopolitical history of Hong Kong.","Leung Chi Wo tends to highlight in his art the boundaries between viewing and voyeurism, real and fictional, and art and the everyday. Leung is generally concerned with aspects of photography that are not strictly visual and often considers the local population and sites in his photographic installations to reflect a deeper critical engagement with globalization and global consumerism. Working often with pinhole photography and mixed media while exploring cityscapes, Leung focuses on the emotional expressions of the urban man through figural portraiture. Specifically, his photography captures the identity and politics of Hong Kong after its return to China in relation to his photographed subjects.",Photojournalist With Two Cameras,Asia,"['protest.n.01', 'background.n.01', 'camera.n.01', 'photograph.n.01', 'prison.n.01', 'rule.n.01', 'imperativeness.n.01', 'print.v.01', 'militant.n.01', 'address.n.03', 'south.n.01', 'studio.n.01', 'attention.n.01', 'shooting.n.01', 'portrayal.n.01', 'photographer.n.01', 'original.s.01', 'scene.n.01', 'history.n.01', 'time.n.01']","['reenactment.n.01', 'photojournalism.n.01', 'protest.n.03', 'china.n.01', 'dictatorship.n.01', 'foreground.v.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/leung_chi_wo_and_sara_wong_photojournalist_with_two_cameras_web.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/leung_chi_wo_and_sara_wong_photojournalist_with_two_cameras_web-200x300.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/photojournalist-with-two-cameras/,"['Cultural/12.872819303159861', 'Politics/6.044230769230769', 'Society/4.7651903651903655']","['Cultural', 'Politics', 'Society']",23.682240437580994,"['Arts/5.56750208855472', 'Media/4.965634674922601', 'Land/2.6198830409356724']","['Arts', 'Media', 'Land']",13.153019804412994,"['Material_Physical/15.448371236606535', 'Cultural/8.9100930115636', 'Individual_Personal/6.8242063492063485']","['Material_Physical', 'Cultural', 'Individual_Personal']",31.182670597376486,"['Land/8.729670329670329', 'Activism/4.275', 'Time/3.3354645354645354']","['Land', 'Activism', 'Time']",16.340134865134864,0.3333333333333333,0.3333333333333333

Adelita Husni-Bey,"Postcards from the Desert Island is a remake of a 50s educational film Holiday from the rules in which four children interact with an omniscient narrator who teleports them to a tropical island where there are no rules. As in Lord of the Flies, the little children’s anarchistic society quickly breaks down. Finally, when the narrator asks the children if they want to leave the island they answer unhesitatingly: “instead of making up a lot of rules, why don’t we go home where we already have them?”.  Adelita Husni-Bey’s film shows her collaboration with a self-run public primary school based in Paris, founded in 1962 by the French educator Robert Gloton, a militant of the experimental pedagogical movement Éducation Nouvelle. During a 3three-week workshop, the artist invited the children to turn their school hall into a desert island. The film documents how the group of youngsters embraces a social life in a no-man’s land, showing how they relate to some of the key principles and unresolved problems of self-governance, such as imagining a life without institutions;, questioning of punishment and the struggle for power, wondering how to deal with immigration and civil disobedience, and where to draw the line between public and private realms.","Born in Milan, Italian-Libyan Adelita Husni-Bey is an artist and researcher. Her practice, which encompasses drawing, painting, collage, video, and participatory workshops, concentrates on micro-utopias, and on how the collective memory works as well as questioning the mechanisms of political and economic power and control.  Her background in sociology as well as fine arts has helped in criticizing prevailing systems of organization of advanced capitalist societies in areas such as labour, schooling and housing. She questions the type of visibility there is in producing an artwork on ‘under-represented communities’, and looks for alternatives as a form of reaction to the way Western society is structured. In that sense, her role as an artist strives to instigate reflection on, and effectively produce, alternative social imaginaries.",Postcards from the Desert Island,Europe,"['child.n.01', 'island.n.01', 'rule.n.01', 'school.n.01', 'public.a.01', 'movie.n.01', 'land.n.01', 'batch.n.02', 'tropical.s.01', 'life.n.01', 'leave.v.01', 'collaboration.n.01', 'struggle.n.01', 'militant.n.01', 'institution.n.01', 'private.a.01', 'document.n.01', 'paris.n.01', 'power.n.01', 'society.n.01', 'cardinal.s.01', 'motion.n.03', 'establish.v.08', 'social.a.01']","['experiment.v.01', 'child.n.01', 'self-government.n.01', 'remake.n.01', 'power.n.01', 'collaboration.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/AHusni-Bey_Adunanza_sala1_ph-©RolandoPaoloGuerzoni_125.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/AHusni-Bey_Adunanza_sala1_ph-©RolandoPaoloGuerzoni_125-300x202.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/postcards-from-the-desert-island/,"['Cultural/6.483516483516483', 'Politics/2.511655011655012', 'Individual_Personal/2.3692307692307693']","['Cultural', 'Politics', 'Individual_Personal']",11.364402264402264,"['Arts/4.026373626373626', 'Power/2.511655011655012', 'Media/2.4571428571428573']","['Arts', 'Power', 'Media']",8.995171495171496,"['Individual_Personal/15.071336996337', 'Cultural/14.763150901386199', 'Society/12.208877397112694']","['Individual_Personal', 'Cultural', 'Society']",42.043365294835894,"['Community/6.315262515262516', 'Spirituality/5.079487179487179', 'Land/4.34065934065934']","['Community', 'Spirituality', 'Land']",15.735409035409035,0.6666666666666666,0.0
Slavs and Tatars,"Wheat Mollah (2011) is one of Slavs and Tatars composite object. The title Wheat Mollah has various interpretations, from “master” or spiritual authority for Shiites and “friend” for Sunnis. The turban is also worn in a diversity of cultures and religions in Africa, Asia and India. However, in this work, the turban is woven in wheat. For Slavs and Tatars, wheat is almost an atavistic element, used in the emblem of the USSR as well as in that of Iran’s first established bank, Bank Sepah and in the one of the revolutionary guards.  For the writer Fionn Meade, Slavs and Tatars’ object can also be described as “reminiscent of Marcel Broodthaers’s early sculptures that targeted Belgian nationalism and bourgeois complicity in colonialism via comic deployment of mussels, coal, and eggs alongside news from the Congo.

Daniel Keller,"To make the video installation Soft Staycation (Gaze Track Edit), the artist, playing the role of ‘job creator’, hired a group of unemployed and expat freelancers through Craigslist to watch a 30 minute compilation of national tourism ads. These ads, which are generally sponsored by various publicly funded tourism boards and screened in airports for example, were found on the Internet by Keller. He used a gaze-tracking camera to measure the eye movements of the people participating in the experiment. Despite the relentlessness of the source, the subjects define zones of attention that the camera records.  Instead of using the gathered gaze data for any specific research purpose, the consumptive gaze is transmuted onto the video itself, creating an ensemble of light spots and shadows. The film is screened on a large LED screen, the same kind used for advertisement purposes. By staging a typical marketing study, the artist points out the persisting automatisms of consumer-spectators, while the flexible LED curtain makes it quite a sculptural and hypnotic piece.","Daniel Keller belongs to a generation of artists born at the end of the 1980s, nourished by digital imagery, who have participated in the social networks as a communication strategy, combining the public and the private spheres; a logical heir to the “entrepreneur” artist of 1990-2000.  Interested in the existence of the artwork on the Internet, as another – or even an extension – exhibition space, Daniel Keller believes in the participation of the public as a critical authority, who can comment, post, re-post the artwork, etc. He reappropriates participatory strategies (for example using charity bands) that find a new echo with the Internet crowdfunding. In his works and his collaborative projects (AIDS-3D), Keller merges art and technology (including the use of new materials) with special attention to social and ecological issues.",Soft Staycation (Gaze Track Edit),Americas,"['gaze.n.01', 'ad.n.01', 'purpose.n.01', 'camera.n.01', 'path.n.04', 'typical.a.01', 'record.n.01', 'eye.n.01', 'video.n.01', 'survey.n.01', 'specific.a.01', 'sculptural.a.01', 'shadow.n.01', 'light.a.01', 'screen.n.01', 'attention.n.01', 'beginning.n.04', 'motion.n.03', 'function.n.03', 'people.n.01', 'piece.n.01', 'movie.n.01']","['marketing.n.02', 'technology.n.01', 'track.v.02', 'tourism.n.01', 'data.n.01', 'gaze.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/softstaycation_bd.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/softstaycation_bd-300x205.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/soft-staycation-gaze-track-edit/,"['Society/10.500722394220844', 'Cultural/5.390196078431373', 'Material_Physical/2.4916996047430833']","['Society', 'Cultural', 'Material_Physical']",18.3826180773953,"['Economy/10.500722394220844', 'Technology/2.9', 'Arts/1.7124183006535947']","['Economy', 'Technology', 'Arts']",15.113140694874438,"['Cultural/12.311746749982046', 'Society/9.149622926093514', 'Material_Physical/8.603316291551586']","['Cultural', 'Society', 'Material_Physical']",30.064685967627145,"['Economy/4.994067370537959', 'Media/4.0970085470085476', 'Geopolitics/4.091503267973856']","['Economy', 'Media', 'Geopolitics']",13.182579185520362,1.0,0.3333333333333333
Fernanda Gomes,"For this floor based work, Gomes has taken two lengths of bamboo and tied them together using linen thread. The work is self-supporting and stands in a crack or a hole in the floor. The work suggests precariousness, frailty as well as humanity through its verticality, and its gentle sinuous form, referencing perhaps the work of Giacometti. Other works in the exhibition recalled the work of Mondrian with an emphasis on horizontal and vertical lines. The fact that this work deviates from an emphasis on the rectilinear should be seen within the context of Gomes’s constructivist routes and her interest in Arte Povera. Allowing the material to express its own inner nature is fundamental to her work. The modest nature of her art suggests a poetics of the immaterial. The standing sculpture, modest though it may be, articulates the space of the room, suggesting a near and a far. Gomes generally makes her work in situ, responding to the space the exhibition will occupy, the gallery thus becoming an extension of her studio.","Fernanda Gomes was born and still works in Rio de Janeiro. Her work is within the tradition of Latin American art that engaged in the postwar era with constructivism and minimalism. Lygia Clark, Helio Oiticica, Lucio Fontana are the names that come to mind when thinking of her Latin American antecedents but in terms of her Northern American forebears it is the Minimalist generation of Robert Ryman and Richard Tuttle that have a bearing on her work. Fernanda Gomes should neither be seen as a Minimalist, nor as an artist in the tradition of Arte Povera, to which her work also clearly relates.  Rather she makes paintings, and more particularly sculptures which are intimate, that examine the interface between sculpture and painting, that look at the gap between the intentional and the accidental as well as the purity of form that is disturbed by the patina of age and time. Her action in bringing materials together is transformative. She sees her works as things, rather than paintings or sculptures, things that relate to and have an effect on the space they inhabit. Gomes’s use of found materials is infused with a strong sense of humanity and vulnerability.",Untitled,Americas,"['floor.n.01', 'nature.n.01', 'vertical.a.01', 'space.n.01', 'line.n.01', 'hole.n.01', 'studio.n.01', 'cardinal.s.01', 'establish.v.08', 'context.n.01', 'sculpture.n.01', 'material.n.01', 'form.n.01']","['humanness.n.01', 'nature.n.01', 'vulnerability.n.01', 'site.n.02', 'constructivist.n.01', 'self-sufficient.s.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/AJG-FG-00045a-site.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/AJG-FG-00045a-site-200x300.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/untitled-14/,"['Individual_Personal/3.9692307692307693', 'Material_Physical/3.9692307692307693', 'Politics/2.307692307692308']","['Individual_Personal', 'Material_Physical', 'Politics']",10.246153846153847,"['Identity/2.3692307692307693', 'Power/2.307692307692308', 'Familial/1.6']","['Identity', 'Power', 'Familial']",6.276923076923078,"['Material_Physical/5.904029304029303', 'Cultural/4.920751633986928', 'Individual_Personal/3.138461538461539']","['Material_Physical', 'Cultural', 'Individual_Personal']",13.96324247647777,"['Arts/4.14297385620915', 'Identity/2.3384615384615386', 'Space/1.746031746031746']","['Arts', 'Identity', 'Space']",8.227467140702434,0.6666666666666666,0.3333333333333333
Karla Black,"Karla Black is a Scottish artist living in Glasgow. Her work draws from a multiplicity of artistic traditions from expressionist painting, land art performance, to formalism. Her large-scale sculptures incorporate modest everyday substances, along with very traditional art-making materials to create abstract forms. Black chooses her media for their tactile aesthetic appeal: the familiarity of the texture of cellophane or the scent of cosmetics bridges the experience of tangible matter with the intimacy of memory or the subconscious. Black’s process is intensely physical and this energy is conveyed through ‘impromptu’ staging of her work; this suggestion of performance psychologically involves the viewer with the making process, provoking instinctive responses to her precarious assemblages. Black’s work evinces childhood memories of cakes and candy floss, of birthdays and ice cream. It is absorptive, immersive and engaging, painterly and sculptural, ephemeral and yet permanent. It always has a fragile appearance and is often fragile, capable of being destroyed by a draught or the actions of a viewer. It teeters on the edge of being and non being.     Not Today is essentially a painting on three sheets of transparent plastic suspended from the walls by scotch tape. These materials are typical of Black’s art.  Suspended in front of a white wall or even a window, the work is as much about light as it is about colour. The layers of the painting coalesce into one plane when the visitor stands before it and yet as a layered painting it also has actual depth.  Black says of her work: “sculpture … can be a pure engulfment and absorption in the material world, when you’re not even aware of yourself, when you have no self consciousness, and you’re not being watched and you’re just purely absorbed in the material world. That is the best possible kind of escape – when you are fully connected to yourself. I think about art as a place to behave, as an escape, not just for me but for the people looking at it,” says Black.  Her emphasis is on materials and their behaviour. “My work is just rooted in the physical, it just is a thing; it’s real. You don’t have to think, “What does it represent?” or “What does it mean?” It is just, like, it is here. And you’re here. And it is just that exchange.“","Karla Black is a Scottish artist living in Glasgow.

Em'kal Eyongakpa,"Em’kal Eyongakpa was born in Cameroon in 1981. After obtaining a postgraduate diploma in Botany and Ecology, he decided to concentrate exclusively on visual and sound art. His use of poetic, symbolic and surrealistic imagery is often sprinkled with paradoxes that challenge the obvious. His work explores human conditioning over time in relation to information, ideological consumption, freedom and identity crises.  The Naked Routes series is related to the history of colonialism. The photographs are taken in places historically weighted in the history of colonization in Cameroon. Working from history and documentation but also from dreams and personal observations, Em’kal Eyongakpa stages himself and performs singular rituals. Repetition and transformation which seem crucial to these rituals find a visual translation in the black and white photographs.  The works n°1 and 21 are also very evocative, outlining a long-term yet brutal narrative that has to be worked out by the spectator.","Em’kal Eyongakpa was born in Cameroon in 1981.

Robert Zhao Renhui,"Expedition #46 is a work from the series “The Glacier Study Group,” which consists of artists, scientists, activists, and enthusiasts of glacial and polar activity in the Artic Circle to conduct scientific investigation, data collection, and glacier sampling. Recent media attention on global warming and climate change has driven interest in increased glacial activity. The group spends long period of each year in the harsh Arctic environment to acquire in-depth knowledge of these changes while experiencing the landscape firsthand. Expedition #46 presents voyeuristic images of human activity in expansive surreal glacial landscapes to elicit a sense of discovery in the viewer, who travels by-proxy via Zhao’s photographic series. The viewer is able to observe the Study Group’s journey in observing their environment and engage in critical reflection of the varying documentary spectatorship deployed in the visual discourse of environmentalism and scientific research.","Zhao Renhui’s photographic prints question fact-based presentations of conservation and highlight the manner through which documentary, journalistic, or scientific reports sensationalize nature in order to elicit viewer sympathy. Zhao portrays human as figures curious about their natural environment, which is at times mysterious and unpredictable. Through observing human behavior in front of animals rather than that of the animals themselves, Zhao’s critical lens examines various modes of what he calls a “zoological gaze,” the manner through which humans view animals and nature. His works create visual ambiguity so the viewer becomes aware of assumptions made about the way images present facts.

Kwan Sheung Chi,"One Million is a video work depicting the counting of bills. Divided into three versions, the video first shows a number of Japanese ten-thousand-yen bills being counted without in an orderly, efficient manner. In Two Million, a similar counting of one-thousand-dollar bills from Hong Kong follows. However, a closer viewing of the videos reveal that they were created by looping the same scene of moving fingers, giving the illusion that many bills are being counted when, in fact, only a few are in the scene. Beyond commenting on the illusions of transactions and interdependencies in a regional economy, the video calls attention to the way media distort quantity as well as manipulations of values occurring with the transcoding of economic units into visual data.

Kiran Subbaiah,"Flight Rehearsals focuses on Subbaiah’s desire to fly as a means to highlight the relationship between human ambition and limitations of the physical world. The video presents philosophical explorations of the human desire to defy gravity and time. The minimalist set of a table highlights the intention and persistence of the protagonist rather than technological innovation. The video manipulates the camera angle to distort the appearance of space so that Subbaiah’s repeated attempts at beating gravity can achieve momentary flights. As the flight attempts move into the bedroom, what first appears to be a close up of an alarm clock turns out to be an oversized ringing alarm clock further back to create a distortion of space through manipulations in scale. Such effects highlight both the proximity and distance between apparent success and distorted perception.","Born in Sidpur and living in Bangalore, Kiran Subbaiah works in a variety of media that includes assemblage, video and internet art after initial training as a sculptor. His works examine the relationships of use and value in everyday objects through subverting form and function. Constructing paradoxes through deadpan and humor, Subbaiah’s works also manipulate the object in an act of emancipation in order to highlight art’s autonomy from having to serve a purpose.

Dominique Zinkpè,"Dominique Zinkpè’s works with a wide range of materials, from jute to used cars to “hôhô” figures, which come from the Cult of Twins in southern Benin as a voodoo religion symbole of fertility. His portfolio is continually morphing between mediums and subjects, tackling issues such as intimacy, sex, the sacred and the profane while linking ancestral culture with the contradictions found in today’s world. These sketches of tumultuous human drama are infused with elements of irony and satire to reveal Zinkpè’s most disturbing and arresting constructs of the imagination. In Cosmos Animiste, Dominique Zinkpé presents a world of ghosts. They show the transformation that people, animals and vegetation undergo, through contact with their environment – an animistic idea. Borrowing from dreams and the world of the spirits, the quasi-human characters in this painting hover above a modern city, and seem agitated in a battle involving desire and metamorphosis. The strange, hybrid beings — both man and animal — engage in scenes of dance, evoking the transcendental power play deeply rooted in Benin culture vis-à-vis games of masquerade, sex and gender. Energetic in its lively colors but at the same time through fragile drawing, reminiscent of graffiti (a big inspiration for Dominique Zinkpé), this painting reminds one of hastily scribbled notes. This little scenery could disappear at once, as it was an epiphany. Drawing from the aesthetic currents and beliefs of the past, this painting underscores unresolved tensions that have arisen from the fusion of Catholicism, animism, and indigenous traditions, with contemporary culture.","Dominique Zinkpé was born in 1969 in Cotonou, Benin.  Dominique Zinkpè is arguably one of the most recognizable contemporary artists to emerge from Benin. He is a versatile self-taught artist, producing drawings, paintings, sculptures and installations. His vivid paintings and drawings are both intimate and revealing, often denouncing injustice and hypocrisy. Beginning at an early age, Zinkpè’s artistic skill was rewarded early on when he won the Young African Talent Prize at the 1993 Grapholies Art Festival in Abidjan, Ivory Coast. Ten years later, during the Dak’art Biennial of Contemporary Art held in the Senegalese capital, he received the prestigious UEMOA Prize for his installation Malgré Tout !. Active and politically aware, Zinkpè developed “Boulev’art: Artists in the Street” in 1999, a project that seeks to bring the work of local contemporary artists to wider attention. Since its creation, six subsequent manifestations of this public rally have taken place in Benin and France. Moreover, in an effort to share his artistic knowledge with others, Zinkpè founded the Ayïzo – Œuvre de l’Esprit association in 1999, which has since opened the “Unik-lieu de création contemporaine”, an artistic space to train and promote contemporary artists. It is also with this goal in mind that Zinkpè assumed his duties as event organizer of the 2010 Benin Biennial.",Cosmos animiste,Middle East & Africa,"['culture.n.01', 'play.n.01', 'ghost.n.01', 'car.n.01', 'note.n.01', 'imagination.n.01', 'dream.n.01', 'dance.n.01', 'animal.n.01', 'concept.n.01', 'battle.n.01', 'universe.n.01', 'uncover.v.01', 'aesthetic.a.01', 'issue.n.01', 'tension.n.01', 'game.n.01', 'colors.n.01', 'environment.n.01', 'tradition.n.01', 'modern.a.01', 'desire.n.01', 'power.n.01', 'contemporary.s.01', 'medium.n.01']","['ghost.n.03', 'latent_hostility.n.01', 'fusion.n.01', 'sex.n.04', 'contradiction.n.01', 'metamorphosis.n.03']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Dominique-Zinkpè-Cosmos-Animiste-©-Raphael-Fanelli-site.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Dominique-Zinkpè-Cosmos-Animiste-©-Raphael-Fanelli-site-300x300.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/cosmos-animiste/,"['Individual_Personal/4.700854700854701', 'Material_Physical/2.3619909502262444', 'Cultural/1.9473684210526314']","['Individual_Personal', 'Material_Physical', 'Cultural']",9.010214072133577,"['Language/1.9473684210526314', 'Spirituality/1.9230769230769231', 'Body/1.7777777777777777']","['Language', 'Spirituality', 'Body']",5.648223121907332,"['Individual_Personal/51.8499333999334', 'Cultural/46.656228901817116', 'Material_Physical/23.05356065503125']","['Individual_Personal', 'Cultural', 'Material_Physical']",121.55972295678177,"['Mind/14.261538461538462', 'Media/12.567006033182503', 'Emotion/12.381618381618384']","['Mind', 'Media', 'Emotion']",39.21016287633935,1.0,0.0
Hayoun Kwon,"Lack of evidence is the account of a Nigerian called Oscar exiled in France, which confronts a historical and social reality with a personal and intimate testimony. Taking as a point of departure Oscar’s request for asylum in France, this fictional document is a peregrination on the different levels of the reconstitution of memory and the subjectivity of its interpretation.  Oscar’s legal testimony reveals a dramatic reality taking place in Nigeria, where family executions still exist in the case of having twins who are considered a ‘diabolical off-spring’. Oscar’s request was rejected based on a lack of evidence. With the use of 3D, Kwon reassessed the real and fictitious qualities of Oscar’s story. The film is constructed through sequences juxtaposing different realities and then by becoming an ideal mise en abîme of the story. The image becomes an elastic characteristic memory and recalls the process of reconstitution. From another perspective, this film questions what constitutes proof and whether this artistic reconstitution of a traumatic event could be used as major evidence, whether art can have an “objective” dimension.","Born in 1981 in Seoul, South Korea Lives and works in Paris and Nantes   Hayoun Kwon was born in South Koera in 1981 and moved to France in 2011 to pursue her studies at the Nantes School of Art and Le Fresnoy, where she presented the video Lack of evidence for her final diploma. The complex relationship with her home country plays a leading role in her work and issues of immigration, political relations, national and extraterritorial laws are a consistent interest. To address these political questions, Kwon became very skilled in using animation, keeping a balance between a real and fictional register.

Daniela Ortiz,"Previously, Ortiz produced a series of photographs related to her research on the position of ‘service architecture’, the vital space given to domestic servants in the modernist architectural houses of South American upper class families.  Following the same formal principal, she has developed a new series called Estat nacio. This  work presents a critical point of view on the construction of a national sovereignty through speeches and laws concerning people who are not considered as citizens according to immigration legislation and the regulations affecting immigrants’ rights and freedom. The project presents an analysis of historical figures related to colonialism, still visible in the public spaces of Barcelona, mainly through monumental statues of military figures, politicians or industrial figures. The series is accompanied by images of institutions that financed and collaborated in colonialism such as the Bank of Barcelona or the Overseas Hispanic Society. A text contextualizes each image and serves as a historical reference for each figure or institution. This is a critical answer to speeches referring to the idea of a Nation-State characterized by a territory, a precise population with a common language and culture.","Through her work, Daniela Ortiz aims to generate visual narratives in which the concepts of nationality, racialization, social class and gender are explored in order to critically understand structures of colonial, patriarchal and capitalist power. Her recent projects and research deal with the European migratory control system, its links to colonialism and the legal structure created by European institutions in order to inflict violence towards racialized and migrant communities. She has also developed projects about the Peruvian upper class and its exploitative relationship with domestic workers. Recently her artistic practice has turned back into visual and manual work, developing art pieces in ceramic, collage and in formats such as children books in order to take distance from Eurocentric conceptual art aesthetics.",General Joan Prim i Prats,Unspecified,"['address.n.03', 'figure.n.01', 'institution.n.01', 'critical.a.01', 'historical.a.01', 'series.n.01', 'population.n.01', 'series.n.01 photograph.n.01', 'industrial.a.01', 'space.n.01', 'see.v.05', 'district.n.01', 'military.a.01', 'architectural.a.01', 'position.n.01', 'common.a.01', 'language.n.01', 'construction.n.01', 'architecture.n.01', 'visible.a.01', 'formal.a.01', 'american.a.01', 'house.n.01', 'family.n.01', 'name.v.01']","['monument.n.02', 'immigration.n.01', 'colonialism.n.01', 'inequality.n.01', 'sovereignty.n.03', 'institution.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/work_prim_daniela_ortiz_baja_2817.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/work_prim_daniela_ortiz_baja_2817-300x87.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/general-joan-prim/,"['Politics/9.686586658955079', 'Society/9.197275239380502', 'Individual_Personal/3.3931623931623935']","['Politics', 'Society', 'Individual_Personal']",22.277024291497973,"['Inequality/3.5426065162907268', 'Power/2.6654761904761903', 'Geopolitics/1.9473684210526314']","['Inequality', 'Power', 'Geopolitics']",8.155451127819548,"['Society/15.134340659340664', 'Cultural/15.038201177907066', 'Material_Physical/11.610866910866914']","['Society', 'Cultural', 'Material_Physical']",41.78340874811464,"['Arts/9.975930115636', 'Land/9.952747252747255', 'Urbanization/8.569505494505494']","['Arts', 'Land', 'Urbanization']",28.498182862888747,0.3333333333333333,0.0
Köken Ergun,"The Battle of Karbala was a military engagement that took place on 10 Muharram, 61 AH (October 10th, 680) in Karbala, situated in present day Iraq, when Hussein, the grandson of the prophet Muhammad, was killed. This battle is central to Shia Muslim belief in which Hussein’s martyrdom is commemorated each year, in a celebration called Ashura which symbolises the birth of Muslim division still at issue today between the Shia and Sunni. During Ashura, the artist worked in close collaboration with the people of Zeynebiye (referring to Hussein’s courageous sister, Zeyneb), documenting their preparations for the ceremonies, which involve a mass theatre performance and the isolated, weeping ritual at the end of the Ashura day. What in other countries is celebrated through a collective performance of blood and pain is experienced here through a highly theatrical and emotional day, presenting Islam as the practice of a culture rather than politics. Ergun attempts to question the cultural importance of religions against a “radical secularism” that has ruled Turkey until now.","Born in Istanbul, in 1976, Köken Ergun studied acting and worked with the American theatre director Robert Wilson. He then became interested in contemporary art, especially video and performance.

Paul Czerlitzki,"In this painting made in 2014, which is part of a series started in 2013, the artist dismantles the traditional painting process. Putting aside any formal intervention, the artist lets the membrane slowly soak up white monochrome paint through a transferring technique before removing it. In some places the structure of the canvas can be seen, while other places of the canvas are purposely blurred to evoke the texture of the material used. Although the artist’s actions can seem surprisingly simple, they express an intellectual potential and a visual complexity that allow the spectators, if not force them, to perceive the work in a clear, definite and slow way.","Born 1986 in Danzig, Pologne Lives and works in Düsseldorf and Paris   Paul Czerlitzki’s work takes part in a reflection on painting and its material components. “The artist has therefore selected a methodological process with which he can repeatedly renegotiate, discover and critically examine painting’s material preconditions, i.e., the frame, the canvas and paint, and the objective, namely, to produce a (panel) painting. He dismantles existing orders by using the canvas as a membrane through which to apply or press colours. He also positions the canvas in relation to the space, as in an installation, or else removes it from the frame and mounts it again slightly off.” (Suzanne Friedli and Elisabeth Gerber)",Ohne Tittle,Europe,"['technique.n.01', 'perceive.v.01', 'intervention.n.01', 'complexity.n.01', 'potential.n.01', 'paint.n.01', 'traditional.a.01', 'formal.a.01', 'simple.a.01', 'structure.n.01', 'action.n.01', 'white.a.01', 'procedure.n.01', 'ocular.a.02', 'spectator.n.01', 'material.n.01', 'series.n.01']","['soak.n.01', 'slow.a.02', 'membrane.n.01', 'painting.n.01', 'procedure.n.01', 'nontraditional.a.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/paul-czerlitzki-st-2013.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/paul-czerlitzki-st-2013-197x300.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/ohne-tittle/,"['Cultural/12.476062989298287', 'Society/7.2835164835164825', 'Material_Physical/4.24174538911381']","['Cultural', 'Society', 'Material_Physical']",24.00132486192858,"['Arts/6.845537958773253', 'Spirituality/3.257142857142857', 'Culture/2.4349206349206347']","['Arts', 'Spirituality', 'Culture']",12.537601450836744,"['Cultural/21.506349206349213', 'Society/17.03553113553114', 'Politics/13.768584356819654']","['Cultural', 'Society', 'Politics']",52.31046469870001,"['Arts/7.255311355311355', 'Economy/5.598168498168498', 'Spirituality/4.795604395604395']","['Arts', 'Economy', 'Spirituality']",17.64908424908425,0.6666666666666666,0.6666666666666666
Nora Schultz,"Halfway between a painting and an installation City Sound of Rug gathers found images, synthetic foam, painted metal plates, and prints placed on the floor. Rugs are elements representative of commerce and related to the idea of territory, handicraft and community. In City Sound of Rug, the rugs are used as surfaces upon which prints are manually made. The traces of paint on the synthetic foam and the paint transfers from one rug to another, enable the spectator to see the materials used as tools, elements that constitute the structure of the installation. City Sound of Rug also incorporates advertising billboards of real estate projects. The work focuses on architecture and urbanism. The use of color is essential in this work: the blue, red and green marks become signs and characterize the work like an act of speech.","Born 1975, Frankfurt / Main, Germany   Lives and works in Berlin  Nora Schulz explores the relations between painting, sculpture, performance, and language. She tends to capture the moment where forms become signs and elements of language. She is interested in translation and in the shifts that occur when external realities and cultural patterns are readapted. She mainly works with industrial materials that she collects in the surroundings of her studio in Berlin (metal of all sorts, rugs, shafts, tubes, ropes). Process and shifting are the bases of her practice which concerns transformation within each context. She remodels found objects into abstract sculpted paintings characterized by precarious balance.

Hossein Valamanesh,"In Runner there are two elements:a big painting and a rolled Persian rug. The rug refers to Iran’s cultural history. The travelling tribes used to transport rugs through the desert on camels or horses so that they would always have a comfortable place to sleep and dream. The oldest known rug is from the 6th century before J.-C. The rugs’ iconography is related to the mythical Paradise garden. The rug used  in Runner refers to the idea of moving in space to emigration and the artist’s story.  The big picture made of natural materials (red sand and lotus flowers) refers to Aboriginal paintings and their relation to cosmic forces. This big abstract surface is a reminder of both the Australian and the Iranian deserts. As in most of his work, Hossein Valamanesh knits a dialogue between two cultures while revealing the universal character of each of them, and situates the individual at the center of this configuration.","Born in Teheran in 1949, Hossein Valamanesh immigrated to Australia in 1973 while going back regularly to Iran. His work is often made out of natural material or found objects such as Persian rugs, family photo albums or clothes. He is influenced by Persian poetry and Sufism, which brings a metaphysical questioning related to his personal reflections. He starts from his own cultural story as an emigrant; from his encounter with another culture to question the human condition. When he arrived in Australia he discovered Aboriginal art which made him decide to stay and settle in Australia. Since then, he has had direct contact with these Aboriginal communities interested in the relation between nature and the cosmos.",Runner,Middle East & Africa,"['horse.n.01', 'garden.n.01', 'dialogue.n.01', 'dream.n.01', 'century.n.01', 'center.n.01', 'red.s.01', 'abstraction.n.01', 'relation.n.01', 'natural.a.01', 'surface.n.01', 'person.n.01', 'picture.n.01', 'cultural.a.01', 'elements.n.01', 'idea.n.01', 'fictional_character.n.01', 'culture.n.01', 'narrative.n.01', 'history.n.01', 'material.n.01', 'space.n.01']","['emigration.n.01', 'cross-cultural.a.01', 'tradition.n.01', 'universal.n.03', 'desert.n.01', 'rug.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/VALAMANESH-Runner-image1-copie.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/VALAMANESH-Runner-image1-copie-300x210.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/runner/,"['Individual_Personal/10.936752136752139', 'Cultural/7.346794871794872', 'Material_Physical/4.8369909502262445']","['Individual_Personal', 'Cultural', 'Material_Physical']",23.120537958773255,"['Mind/4.774358974358975', 'Culture/3.269230769230769', 'Geopolitics/2.8473684210526313']","['Mind', 'Culture', 'Geopolitics']",10.890958164642377,"['Individual_Personal/28.074561876032476', 'Cultural/22.365454480160373', 'Material_Physical/15.070940480228407']","['Individual_Personal', 'Cultural', 'Material_Physical']",65.51095683642126,"['Mind/9.469036845507436', 'Values/7.60467032967033', 'Design/5.589671766142354']","['Mind', 'Values', 'Design']",22.66337894132012,1.0,0.3333333333333333
Lee Kit,"The work Tender is composed of several elements: a porcelain spoon, a florescent lamp box, a small portable night light, a shelf with nearly invisible embossments of flowers and a jar of jam resting on a black plastic tray. The cardboard painting is made of acrylic and inkjet ink on which we can read Tender. Tender is a brand of extra soft tissue paper, it refers to an intimate comfort but results in a sentiment of melancholy and absence. This installation is made of universal elements. Nothing is context specific however, it’s always site specific, in the sense that he uses very small gestures to alter the situation of a given space.","Born in 1978 in Hong Kong Lives and works in Taipei, Taiwan   Lee Kit represented the Honk Kong pavilion at the Venice Biennale in 2013 where the exhibition was turned into a half functional private space. The visitor entered a neutral room, open and loose but precisely organized. The artist was searching to deliver both an atmosphere and a still image. In fact, the artist uses the term “setting” to define his paintings, ready-mades or performances. His work comments on the long-term dialectic between form and function. Once made, his hand-painted pieces of cloth are used for picnics and diners and his monochrome sheets of linen serve as blankets, pillows or tablecloths in exhibitions. He says, “I am not expressing an emotion: I am expressing my attitude through my paintings”. These objects are clues of his biography as they express a form of life, his daily life in Honk Kong. And if the name of a brand appears on his cardboard paintings, it is less a reference to consumerism (i.e. Pop art) than a love for details. If there is a reference to art history, it would be the 17th century Dutch painter Johannes Vermeer for his depiction of middle class interiors, his attention to details and light. Nothing is really happening in his paintings, but you have the feeling that something important is going to happen.",Tender,Asia,"['specific.a.01', 'elements.n.01', 'soft.a.01', 'read.v.01', 'plastic.n.01', 'cardboard.n.01', 'change.v.01', 'night.n.01', 'box.n.01', 'situation.n.01', 'gesture.n.01', 'compose.v.01', 'black.a.01', 'paper.n.01', 'sense.n.01', 'light.n.01', 'space.n.01']","['ready-made.n.01', 'site.n.02', 'universal.n.03', 'melancholy.n.02', 'comfort.n.05', 'autobiography.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/High-res-image-Lee-Kit-2012-Tender-Installation-view-courtesy-Vitamin-Archivesite.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/High-res-image-Lee-Kit-2012-Tender-Installation-view-courtesy-Vitamin-Archivesite-300x224.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/untitled-25/,"['Society/6.248717948717949', 'Cultural/6.217948717948718', 'Individual_Personal/4.1346405228758165']","['Society', 'Cultural', 'Individual_Personal']",16.60130718954248,"['Emotion/4.1346405228758165', 'Arts/2.371794871794872', 'Economy/2.371794871794872']","['Emotion', 'Arts', 'Economy']",8.878230266465561,"['Material_Physical/8.490262515262515', 'Individual_Personal/7.284766214177979', 'Cultural/3.977777777777778']","['Material_Physical', 'Individual_Personal', 'Cultural']",19.75280650721827,"['Body/2.543740573152338', 'Time/2.541666666666667', 'Environmental/2.4904761904761905']","['Body', 'Time', 'Environmental']",7.575883430295196,0.6666666666666666,0.0
Uri Aran,"Like much of Aran’s work this sculptural installation is akin to a riddle. It has no exact meaning, and it can be somewhat frustrating, yet with careful inspection it begins to reveal unexpected information. In his 2014 exhibition at Peep-Hole, Milan, where this work was shown, Aran referred in a series of new works to Mancala games. These ancient pastimes (popular throughout the Middle East, Africa and Asia) typically employ a perforated board and pieces formed out of seeds or stones. In an analogy to agricultural activity, Mancala games are at once elementary and poetically allusive; in their combination of improvised apparatus, rudimentary rules and metaphorical potency, they furnish an oblique metaphor for Aran’s art, in particular his ranging, open-ended and atemporal mode of sculpture. The still-life assemblage Game II elaborates upon the idea of ‘art as game’, embodying the same basic interplay of organization and chance, recalling childhood games and activities. While the work invokes Giacometti’s No More Play it also suggests the active processes of making works of art, conscious, unconscious and trial and error.","Born in 1977 in JerusalemLives and works in New York.  Uri Aran, born in Israel and based in New York, is young artist working in sculpture, installation, video and drawing. Much of Aran’s work is about grouping things together, assembling the detritus of the studio, images and objects that relate to his own life, in an attempt to make sense out of random things. He has stated: “In my own work the excitement and simultaneous pathos associated with the limitations of taxonomy are always present. I don’t establish logical equivalencies (…) instead I take parts of lists, classifications and narrative habits and I pluck, recapitulate and re-assign. My work has nothing to do with nonsense – in fact quite the opposite. I activate the highly sensitive reflex responses that a viewer might have to a trigger such as a piece of music, food, or a photo and I adjust the allegiances of that reflex. In this manner objects, language, intonation, everything develops an eccentricity that can be unnerving, perplexing, funny, poetic, and tragic ad infinitum.”",Game II,Americas,"['game.n.01', 'activity.n.01', 'rule.n.01', 'opportunity.n.01', 'combination.n.01', 'childhood.n.01', 'africa.n.01', 'metaphor.n.01', 'center.n.01', 'uncover.v.01', 'sculptural.a.01', 'rock.n.01', 'popular.a.01', 'play.n.01', 'meaning.n.01', 'manner.n.01', 'procedure.n.01', 'idea.n.01', 'sculpture.n.01', 'piece.n.01', 'series.n.01']","['game.n.01', 'open-ended.s.01', 'autobiography.n.01', 'procedure.n.01', 'conscious.s.01', 'trial_and_error.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/ua_peephole_03.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/ua_peephole_03-200x300.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/game-ii/,"['Cultural/13.048351648351648', 'Society/13.028571428571427', 'Individual_Personal/8.22857142857143']","['Cultural', 'Society', 'Individual_Personal']",34.3054945054945,"['Spirituality/6.514285714285714', 'Media/3.4571428571428573', 'Culture/3.314285714285714']","['Spirituality', 'Media', 'Culture']",13.285714285714285,"['Cultural/46.66336457659987', 'Individual_Personal/39.9742673992674', 'Society/28.120879120879124']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Society']",114.75851109674639,"['Arts/16.16495187818718', 'Spirituality/13.11648351648352', 'Culture/11.47997557997558']","['Arts', 'Spirituality', 'Culture']",40.76141097464628,1.0,0.6666666666666666
Marie Voignier,"Tourisme International was shot as the recording of a show on the scale of a country. In the urgency of perpetual travel, this tourist journey visits monuments, museums, institutions presented by North Korean guides whose voices we do not hear. Marie Voignier entirely redesigned the sound of each sequence in post-synchronization, making only the living experiences of footsteps and rustling of clothes audible, to create a new universe, disconnected from the official discourses. In this new decor, the artist attempts to re-appropriate the image she shot (frames and length were decided by the organizers), and gives another view of a country in perpetual representation of itself: a cinematographic representation that can be screened.     Interview in French with the artist about this film:  http://www.abraslecorps.com/pages/web_tv.php?id_video=50&page=2","Marie Voignier was born in 1974 and lives in Paris.  Marie Voignier’s work presents a subtle criticism of the transitory status of fiction within the social and political fields. One could think of her work as a documentary practice when it could rather be considered as fiction, which, beyond its collective inscription finds itself sent to the heart of the intimate, in a movement of individuation. Working on these boundaries, the artist flushes out the erring ways of a collective imagination. For instance her first full-length film L’hypothèse du Mokélé-Mbembé (2012) follows the quest of a French zoologist who investigates pygmy stories about a prehistoric monster. For years, he has crossed the jungle back and forth looking for the unknown animal: the Mokélé-Mbembé.",Tourisme international,Europe,"['ageless.s.01', 'state.n.04', 'representation.n.01', 'voice.n.01', 'life.n.02', 'institution.n.01', 'universe.n.01', 'shoot.v.01', 'sequence.n.01', 'journey.n.01', 'sound.n.01', 'scale.n.01', 'attempt.n.01', 'museum.n.01', 'frame.n.01', 'experience.n.01', 'position.n.03', 'make.v.03', 'movie.n.01', 'image.n.01']","['tourism.n.01', 'propaganda.n.01', 'disconnect.v.02', 'rustle.n.01', 'north_korea.n.01', 'footfall.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/capture_decran_2014-05-22_a_16.42.31.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/capture_decran_2014-05-22_a_16.42.31-300x146.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/untitled-27/,"['Society/6.808996851102114', 'Material_Physical/4.9409532750493845', 'Politics/1.0']","['Society', 'Material_Physical', 'Politics']",12.749950126151498,"['Economy/5.261988304093567', 'Land/2.6198830409356724', 'Activism/1.0']","['Economy', 'Land', 'Activism']",8.88187134502924,"['Cultural/30.4409645909646', 'Individual_Personal/26.937118437118446', 'Material_Physical/16.555763843999145']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Material_Physical']",73.9338468720822,"['Culture/13.772527472527475', 'Mind/10.400732600732603', 'Media/9.215689865689866']","['Culture', 'Mind', 'Media']",33.38894993894994,0.3333333333333333,0.0

Conrad Ruiz,"Conrad Ruiz loves to paint subjects related to the “boy zone”: video games, weapons, games, science fiction, fantasy, and special effects. He also often works at a very large scale to emphasize a connection to the tradition of history painting. Blockbuster (2011) was, at the time of its creation, the largest watercolor painting he had ever made. This commissioned piece combines his bombastic and playful style with a tribute to San Francisco’s thriving arts and culture scenes. It is a lively depiction of famous landmarks in the city, and a somewhat fanciful and lighthearted recapitulation of how a potential earthquake would shake things up in the ultimate “boy zone.”","Conrad Ruiz makes watercolor paintings of fantastic scenes. Bursts of color and energy sit behind flying figures and animals. Images become painted patterns, as rows of repeated objects and buildings’ striations verge on geometric abstraction. Ruiz’ identifies his work with the “ultimate boy zone”, and the connection is clear. His paintings are populated by explosions, giant sharks, and athletes.

Clare Rojas,"Rojas’s two pieces in the Kadist Collection—Untitled (four-legged…) and Untitled (Bird’s Eyes)—are representative of her pictorial style which uses bold colorful blocks of paint and female and animal characters. While Untitled (Bird’s Eyes) does not depict any actual women, it nevertheless alludes to gender roles and the power of the female gaze. Apparently playful, this scene of two animals has an ominous quality: A bird and a hedgehog confront at each other and the bird appears to be poking, even eating the hedgehog’s eye.","Trained in printmaking at the Rhode Island School of Design, Clare Rojas is a painter inspired in equal parts by cartoons, quilting, street, and folk art.

Charles Ray,"To make the well-known work All My Clothes (1973), the artist posed for 16 photographs, modeling every item of clothing in his wardrobe. An experiment in self-portraiture, it deftly touches on anthropology, identity construction, and art history. In its methodical, purported completeness, it pokes fun at Minimalism’s dogged adherence to comprehensive systems. Its quasi-scientific method of documentation calls into question the idea of art as purely aesthetic expression. It also says something about the essential consumerism that underlies the art market.","The Los Angeles–based artist Charles Ray disorients and disarms viewers of his work via experiments in perception and scale. In one of his best-known interventions, he arranged the fabrication of a painted aluminum replica of a toy fire truck, but at the size of an actual fire truck, and parked it outside the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York. Though playful, Ray’s work often disturbs assumed cultural notions. Family Romance (1993) is a fiberglass sculpture of a nuclear family. Mother, father, and two young children stand holding hands, naked and eerily scaled so that they are all the same height. While Ray’s subjects are varied, they consistently engage with deeply rooted assumptions about what is “correct” or “right” in order to investigate the power structures that underlie relationships.",All My Clothes,Americas,"['market.n.01', 'documentation.n.01', 'expression.n.01', 'aesthetic.a.01', 'construction.n.01', 'identity.n.01', 'question.n.01', 'idea.n.01', 'history.n.01', 'photograph.n.01']","['identity.n.02', 'system.n.07', 'pseudoscience.n.01', 'self-portrait.n.01', 'anthropology.n.01', 'consumerism.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/charles_ray_all_my_clothes.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/charles_ray_all_my_clothes-300x52.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/all-my-clothes/,"['Cultural/8.227539436827362', 'Individual_Personal/6.647263993316625', 'Material_Physical/5.5788961038961045']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Material_Physical']",20.45369953404009,"['Mind/5.6948830409356725', 'Physics/3.1800865800865803', 'Economy/1.9090909090909092']","['Mind', 'Physics', 'Economy']",10.784060530113162,"['Individual_Personal/23.004329004329016', 'Cultural/21.149495439201328', 'Society/7.657142857142857']","['Individual_Personal', 'Cultural', 'Society']",51.8109673006732,"['Arts/7.209640522875817', 'Identity/5.575757575757575', 'Values/5.12967032967033']","['Arts', 'Identity', 'Values']",17.915068428303723,0.6666666666666666,0.0
Chadwick Rantanen,"Telescopic Pole is an adjustable telescopic pole that extends vertically from floor to ceiling and is held up by its own internal pressure. The ends, protected by two, cut-open tennis balls, recall the legs of a walker. For Rantanen’s second solo exhibition at Jancar Jones Gallery, San Francisco in 2010, one pole was placed inside the gallery while the other was located outside. This visual echo both suggested reflection and called attention to the physical viewing conditions. The muffled poles seemed to connect the spaces, to hold them up and together, while the fixity of their positions was in tension with the idea of movement suggested by the allusion to a walking-aid.","Chadwick Rantanen is an emerging, Los Angeles-based artist.

Fabrice Hyber,"Drawing, which is the essential embodiment of Fabrice Hyber’s artistic thinking, is at the origin of all his works. The artist uses accumulation, hybridization and mutation to create constant shifts between extremely varied domains. Each work is just an intermediate, evolving stage of this “work in progress” that spreads like a proliferation of thought, establishing links and exchanges that then help to create other connections. The process is inspired by the way in which the cell systems grow in living organisms, with immigrant and feeding flows, reflecting the passion for science that motivates the artist, who trained as a mathematician.","In each of his self-portraits, Fabrice Hyber (he removed the last “t” in Hybert in 2004) is elusive. This has been expressed in the photo “C’est le moment de se préparer à de nouvelles expériences” (It’s time to prepare for new experiences) (1987), or when we look at the upside down, hanging by one foot in “Traduction, le plus gros savon du monde” (Translation, the biggest soap in the world) (1991). “I? am an alien! ” says the artist. “Games and shifts are the only things able to face any kind of fundamentalism. Trade, commerce, image and poetry are means of osmosis. Through them gradually you can set up all of the ways to increase life beyond death. It is necessary to mix time, upgrade products, and imagine that works die in order to be assimilated then revisited. A work is absolutely not precognitive but always from here” said Fabrice Hyber in conversation with Thierry Laurent. Fabrice Hyber was born in 1961 in Luçon, France.

Alban Hajdinaj,"Wash and Go (2001) is divided into two stages and operates like a slide show. In the first part, the camera scans the interior of an apartment, focusing on elements of daily life to finally settle and frame a bottle of shampoo with the slogan “Wash and Go.” The camera isolates the word “Go ” and slides over the word “Away”, and then takes focuses on another slogan “The People You Need are only a touch away.” Afterwards, the camera gradually widens its frame to reveal a billboard campaign in the streets of Tirana. The images reveal a devastated city, dotted with scrappy buildings, and urban noises – each of who accompany this vision of abandonment.","Alban Hajdinaj creates parallel worlds, fictions from a chaotic context: his generation and his country.  His installations assemble objects, photos, videos and paintings: domestic objects (porcelains, figurines) are reactivated as ready-madescollaged together to generate narrative tension.

Loris Gréaud,"This work refers to the “Dream Machines”, an experimental object invented by the painter and writer Brion Gysin and the scientist Ian Sommerville, and which is composed of a light bulb with light passing through slits in a rotating cylinder. Loris Gréaud revisits the structural mechanism; the light variations, following the frequency shift of the “Dream Machines”,, which is transcribed here by the undulations of the light produced by the filament lamps. Beyond this technological reference, the artist also quotes stories, legends, rumors about this invention in order to crystallize them in a contemporary technological object. The light frequency generates mental images, physiologically modifying the information transmitted to the brain via the optical nerve and psychologically modifying the state of consciousness of the spectator. These changes in vision need to be experienced in the entire space of the exhibition – as was the case during Silence Goes More Quickly When Played Backwards at Le Plateau, Paris, in 2005. Dream Machines, to be seen with eyes closed, was in parallel with another of his works in the Kadist collection, CFL, watercress shoots that the spectator was invited to consume in order to better perceive in the dark space.  The three lightboxes create a screen and the spectator’s mental images are projected on this surface. Gréaud removed the screen from its usual rationales as an optical device, to allow the gaze to enter the imaginary.","Research by Loris Gréaud is pieced together in the exhibition space in effort to build a total work of art and a world view. “Cellar Door,” his solo exhibition held at the Palais de Tokyo in  2008, is constructed like a movie set, spanning across divergent processes and temporalities. Gréaud’s work, extracted from science fiction literature, technology, and science, questions immateriality as well as the real and the virtual. He is known to make references to Yves Klein in “The Merzball Pavilion” (2008), to spread the smell of the planet Mars in “Spirit” (2005), to remodel an apartment magnetic fields specialist in “Residents 1” (2005), to send messages in Morse code by light in “Limen” (2003), and create nanosculptures with “Untilted01” (2006). The artist does not make the invisible visible, but instead makes the invisible readable. “These notions of invisibility and off-screen non-presence are engines of desire” Gréaud states. Paul Ardenne when speaking about Gréaud referred to him as the “artist as phenomenologist,” describing his works and their high degree of sophistication as a “phenomenological subject.”     Loris Gréaud was born in 1979 in Eaubonne, France.

Felix Gmelin,"Ambiguous Gestures takes as its point of origin a film Gmelin discovered in his father’s archive. Filmed from a fixed point, it portrays his father in an intimate performance of body painting with a woman unknown to Felix Gmelin. The discovery of this footage was obviously disturbing. On the one hand there is an erotic encounter with someone who is not Gmelin’s mother; on the other hand the performance itself is strangely unerotic and unsensual. The performance clearly references the work of Klein and the Viennese actionists but has an Arcadian element divorced from the Viennese school. Two acts of painting take place; the mutual painting of bodies and the impression of those bodies on a series of canvases. Taking that as his own starting point, working from stills Felix Gmelin then painted his own paintings with the help also of an assistant, thus paralleling the process of his father. He wanted to focus on the painting aspect of the film rather than its erotic potential and draw a comparison between painting and film, further enhanced by the display of stills that forms part of the installation. The grisâtre quality of the paintings serves to highlight the intense colour of the film. By making what in some respects are conventional paintings from this most intimate of films, and painting found images, Gmelin neutralises its erotic charge, making the film ‘innocent, beautiful and affirmative’. While the film is ‘embarrassing in every possible sense’ to the artist, its conjunction with his paintings and the stills transforms it into another manifestation of a utopian project. Gmelin cleanses his father ‘s work literally and metaphorically, washing the film and creating paintings using rubber gloves and brushes.","With a degree in painting and inspired by so-called institutional criticism, Felix Gmelin is interested in the possibilities of painting as a form of resistance and its direct relation to a form of socio-political reality. He is frequently known to rework the experiences of his youth into his art. In a critical, yet personal investigation, he subtly unravels the complicated interweaving of self-development, socialization and emancipation with which he grew up in the late 1960s and 1970s. Gmelin’s first substantial work in which reproduction served as a productive impetus was Art Vandals (1996-1998), a series of 12 paintings and one object, modeled after examples of modern and contemporary artworks, all of which had been vandalized. His interest in degenerate art also falls within the interest of vandalism. The emptying of meaning is a consistent theme in his work, as a number of Gmelin’s paintings.Felix Gmelin was born in Heidelberg in 1962 and has lived in Stockholm, Sweden, since he was nine.",Ambiguous Gestures,Europe,"['father.n.01', 'movie.n.01', 'body.n.01', 'performance.n.01', 'hand.n.01', 'mother.n.01', 'school.n.01', 'footage.n.01', 'display.n.01', 'brush.n.06', 'film.v.01', 'potential.n.01', 'component.n.01', 'aspect.n.01', 'quality.n.01', 'gesture.n.01', 'beginning.n.04', 'woman.n.01', 'impression.n.01', 'sense.n.01', 'undertaking.n.01', 'procedure.n.01']","['erotic.s.01', 'cleanse.v.02', 'recreate.v.04', 'utopian.a.02', 'father.n.01', 'still.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/vg-gmelf-00021.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/vg-gmelf-00021-238x300.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/ambiguous-gestures/,"['Cultural/3.2540849673202614', 'Individual_Personal/1.9230769230769231']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal']",5.177161890397184,"['Familial/1.9230769230769231', 'Design/1.5555555555555556', 'Media/0.875']","['Familial', 'Design', 'Media']",4.353632478632479,"['Individual_Personal/27.3645645032642', 'Cultural/20.549511599511607', 'Material_Physical/14.509188034188039']","['Individual_Personal', 'Cultural', 'Material_Physical']",62.42326413696385,"['Values/6.65845004668534', 'Media/6.554151404151405', 'Spirituality/6.426373626373626']","['Values', 'Media', 'Spirituality']",19.63897507721037,0.8,0.3333333333333333
Omer Fast,"This work is based on a temporal loop in which the stories of several duets coexist and interfere with each other. The narrative articulates itself around four key moments or four neighboring apartments that the viewer discovers progressively: an air stewardess having an argument with her unemployed husband, and old lady telling old stories that no longer interest her caregiver, a black woman who is accused of stealing jewelry just when a newcomer, of Arab origin, moves into the apartment block. The narration itself is based on a void or non-event, however its dialogues refer to subjects such as terrorism or iimmigration. Even if the work remains deliberately vague in its global intention, the clash between personal stories and fictional characters of different origins and generations operates as metaphor of our contemporary society.","In his videos and installations, Omer Fast links and merges personal stories, collective history reality and fiction as well as experience and one’s making of it. Fast is interested in different types of discourse carried out in contemporary political and social events. In the work CNN concatenated (2002), for instance, an American journalist’s speech is modified to deliver a different meaning. Omer Fast was born in 1972 in Jerusalem, Israel.

Jun Nguyen Hatsushiba,"Filmed underwater, this is the third video in Nguyen-Hatsushiba’s “Memorial Project” series which began in 2001. The title already implies the cultural complexities about to be ironically unravelled: Ho Chi Minh is parodied and Okinawa (where this was filmed) was a battle site in Japan during World War II which then became an American training base during the Vietnam War. To a remix of James Bond movie tracks composed by Quoc Bao, no less than thirty divers in wet suits and full gear advance against the water resistance armed with cartridges of color. They attack trestles with blank canvases on which they attempt to paint a yellow star but, after a showering of digital white stars likened to the American flag (presumably alluding to Christmassy snow), they find themselves uncontrollably portraying actors who played in Vietnam-related films like Marlon Brando, Michael Cimino, Robert De Niro… which then, end up leading to collapse and dissolving. Water creates a parallel world, symbolic of universal consciousness, which allows for the slow contemplation of these potentially alienating cultural transmissions. Nguyen-Hatsushiba’s dramatized soft critique is across the board, from the sheer weight of Vietnamese tradition on one hand, to America’s geo-political and cultural hegemony on the other, as well as the way war is represented in the media and in cinema (Vietnam was one of the first conflicts to have broad coverage).","Jun Nguyen-Hatsushiba initially trained as a painter in the United States and references to the act of paint easel painting and are regularly present in his videos. Since 2001, he is world renowned for his series of underwater videos, called “Memorial Project”, which revisit the history and culture of Vietnam, and its relations with the United States. Although the actual filming has an actual dangerous side for the artist and the actors, as a direct connection with Vietnamese boat people, they have a certain dream-like quality due to the slow motion in the liquid environment. typical national tropes which are integrated count rickshaws, rice picking, water puppets and dragons, the yellow star on the flag but these are generally intermingled and confused by overriding American cultural references. Through running performances across cities around the world, titled Breathing is Free: 12,756.3, Jun Nguyen-Hatsushiba pursues his humanistic artistic action denouncing global refugee crisis. His practice also includes drawing and large scale installations.

Philip-Lorca diCorcia,,"The works of Philip-Lorca diCorcia oscillate between two possible definitions of photography – from a recording system in the tradition of documentary and a system of representation in the tradition of fiction. The use of different contradictory light sources in the same picture is symptomatic of his staging of reality. In Napoli 1996 a man walking down the street in broad daylight is fictionalized by the flash of the camera. Related to the world of cinema in the case of  “Hollywood” (1990-1992), fashion in the series “W” (1997-2000), and advertising, the photographer questions the representation of reality, between the utopia of transparency and necessary construction. “I try to criticize the beast I work with. This monster of whom I share my bed with is about me,” the artist says. His photographs are a space alien in the world of the viewer because of the absorbance of characters. In “Mario” (1978), a man leaning in front of a refrigerator is estranged to the outside world, far from the viewer, denying his/her presence. Immobility is also a constant in the artist’s work. Psychological tension and dramatical equilibrium structure his photographs like enigmas or like “moments suspended in narratives that unfold,” as critic Peter Galassi suggests.Phillip-Lorca diCorcia was born in 1951 in Hartford, Connecticut, USA.",New York City,Americas,[],"['immobility.n.02', 'narrative.s.01', 'stagy.s.01', 'tension.n.03', 'cinematic.a.01', 'photography.n.02']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/dicorcia_-_ny_city.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/dicorcia_-_ny_city-300x197.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/new-york-city/,"['Material_Physical/2.4571428571428573', 'Individual_Personal/1.6', 'Cultural/1.0']","['Material_Physical', 'Individual_Personal', 'Cultural']",5.057142857142857,"['Arts/1.0', 'Time/0.8571428571428571', 'Identity/0.8']","['Arts', 'Time', 'Identity']",2.6571428571428575,[],[],0.0,[],[],0.0,,
Julius Koller,"Wordplay was a central focus of Koller’s work, in particular the acronym U.F.O., which he adapted in his diagrammatic drawings to stand variously for Univerzálna Futurologická Organizácia (Universal Futurological Organization, 1972–3), Univerzálny Filozoficky Ornament (Universal Philosophical Ornament, 1978) or Underground Fantastic Organization (1975), and which also appeared in a series of slapsticky self-portraits titled ‘U.F.O.–naut’ (1970–2007). These infinite variations on a common cipher constituted an insistent incantation of the Utopian principle. Friedrich Nietzsche argued that to realize a fundamental critique of ‘bad faith’ means to move beyond cynicism and embrace a radical optimism that exceeds the petty dialectics of expectation and disappointment. In his approach to life and art as the U.F.O.–naut, Koller embodied precisely this: he actualized the potential of his imagination as a form of existential agency. As we get entangled in the strange possibilities of art and ideas, we all become U.F.O.–nauts and are deeply indebted to Koller, our patron saint of U.F.O.–nauts.","In its stringency, obsession and peculiarity, the oeuvre of Julius Koller is one of the most idiosyncratic and consistent in European art since the 1960s. Yet Koller is not only a seminal figure in the history of the neo- and post-avant-garde; his work has long been a critical inspiration for artists and intellectuals. In the most recent past, Koller’s concepts of the Anti-Happening, the Anti-Picture, the Universal-cultural Futurological Operation (U.F.O.), his actions, objects, texts and the enormous referential archive he built up, have attracted growing interest on the part of a broader art public.  From around 1960, in response to the modernist mainstream in Slovak art, Julius Koller began to develop his aesthetic position of the “antihappening.” His strategy consists in using real objects and everyday life as the predefined program for an aesthetic operation: from 1965, in texts rubberstamped on paper that refer to the context of the “anti-happening,” and then in 1967/1968 in pictures for which Koller used white latex paint instead of oils and which saw the first appearance of the question mark—the symbol of Koller’s brands of naming, or “making known,” that was later to undergo many mutations in various media and states of aggregation. The “invitation cards for an idea”—as Koller called the text works relating to the “anti-happenings”—and the palimpsests and serial arrangements of the “anti-pictures” set themselves apart from the academicism of Modernism in more than just formal terms. Koller foregoes every form of technical mastery. The “anti-pictures” are amateurish in style, ensuring that they fulfill their task, defined by Koller as “engaging rather than arranging.”Julius Koller was born in 1939 in Piestany, Slovakia.

Kristof Kintera,"Bad innovation in the name of protection is not a ready-made, but was made entirely by the artist, representing a stroller. Its interior is shielded and designed for babies in the case of conflict. Camouflaged, it resembles a small tank. Is it to protect or to attack? Is this object, full of ambiguity, for harmless babies or child soldiers? Privileged or excluded, this work alludes to survival and inequality faced by the question of life or death. The object materializes the primitive desire of protection induced by fear. How can we look at the world through this stroller? Is the pleasure of  seeing, breathing, feeling, still possible? Is it a shield to live, to survive or to go against life?","Kristof Kintera is a major artist of the contemporary Czech scene also with international acclaim. His works refer to doubts expressed in societies under authoritarian or communist regimes who find themselves in economic boom, yet leave behind local concerns. In the artist’s work, a sense of observation, often caustic, helps to establish a critical distance between oneself and the world, by using everyday objects cleverly diverted. Vivid and moving, the works of Kintera evoke primitive feelings of the human condition such as fear, desire for survival, and pleasure.Kristof Kintera was born in 1973 in the Czech Republic.

Thomas Kilpper,"These two images come from the series called “State of Control” which Kilpper made in the building formerly occupied by the Stasi in Berlin. As a symbol of the past there could be none more powerful than this. By carving into its floor, Kilpper laid bare its history by making images of its occupants and political figures associated with that period of history. Willy Brandt, Guenter Guillaume and Dietrich Sperling reminds us of all the intrigue of the Cold War when Brandt’s secretary Guillaume was passing secrets at the highest level to the East. Seen whispering in Brandt’s ear, he is perceived to be feeding false information. Sperling was a minister in Brandt’s government. The photograph on which the image is based was taken at the height of Guillaume’s treachery and treasonous conduct. The image of John Heartfield standing behind Silvio Berlusconi is based on a photomontage of Heartfield with the President of the Berlin Police Karl Zoergiebel of 1929 thus bringing together Heartfield, one of the greatest and most vivid critics of the Nazi era and manipulator of images through collage, with Berlusconi, one of the most rightwing, but freely elected leaders in Europe who manipulates the news and images through his media empire. These images are large scale and have a dramatic impact. In his use of woodcut, Kilpper’s work resonates with the large scale woodcuts of Christiane Baumgartner already in the collection.","Thomas Kilpper’s work engages with history and politics in a manner that recalls the 1960s in terms of his committed engagement. Typically Kilpper takes over a building and investigates its history, carving into the floor to make woodcuts which he then prints on a large scale onto fabric that floats free when he hangs it. In The Ring, a project he made in London in 2000, and of which the Tate bought a substantial part, he investigated the history of the area in which the building of the Tate was situated, making images connected with boxing (the site had previously housed a well known boxing ring), the Ministry of Defense (which had a secret printing press in the building) and Tate Modern (that was about to open around the corner). In Drowning Hercules he used bits of wood from Riddell House, a building about to be demolished to build an oversized tree which he located in the defunct swimming pool. Kilpper’s strategy is to work with buildings condemned for demolition and to use only materials he finds on site to make art. In that respect his work engages with the art of Gordon Matta-Clark but by inscribing himself into the building, rather than simply cutting it up, he puts forward a different point of view. He has no studio, is constantly on the move and starts each project from scratch. Research is a fundamental tool of his practice and the result is normally an artistic intervention into politics and history. Thus Kilpper combines a strong conceptual basis with considerable technical skill in making images that have dramatic impact and presence.  Thomas Kilpper was born in Stuttgart, Germany, in 1956.

Christian Jankowski,"In New York City’s Chinatown, subject Suat Ling Chua’s morning exercise is to practice the hula hoop. When Christian Jankowski first saw this woman he immediately got the idea to shoot Rooftop Routine. In the short video, Chua leads the group and dictates the movements that each participant has to repeat. Only one person of the group can directly see Chua and thus each person mimics another from roof to roof, altering the choreography after each passage like in a play of “Chinese whispers.” With this performance, Jankowski explores the social organization of a specific context. It brings together people of several buildings in the same project beyond isolation and social barriers of the urban environment. “In a work, new things, unknown things can happen. The important thing is to initiate a project to bring together the right people. Then the mechanism takes unpredictable paths. Until…voila!..the work is done,” says Jankowski.","Christian Jankowski’s practice ranges from photography, films, and performances, involving audiences or often people unfamiliar to contemporary art. He claims that his “main drive always comes from the pleasure of meeting people and working with them.” Through the manipulation of humor, collaboration, popular culture and magic, Jankowski creates links between art and people with a certain simplicity and relevance. Meeting with participants and making negotiations are an integral part of his work, as well as the elements of chance and accident. Jankowski’s work is about life as it is lived. His way of juxtaposing different worlds and subcultures as a way to explore social systems and their organization is both attractive and serious. In one of his early work My Life as a Dove (1996), the artist was transformed into a dove by a magician. This performance introduces one of the recurring themes of his work – transformation and how the artwork may change the way we perceive the world and its organization.Christian Jankowski was born in 1968 in Göttingen, Germany.

John Isaacs,"A child and dreamer my whole life long (broken tree) (2004) is a sculpture made of filler, wire, copper, oil paint, and wood depicting a tree just at it’s moment of breaking into half – one part alive with foliage and blooming branches and the other the crisp of the break exposed, with the trunk adhered solidly to a plinth. The sculpture appears to speak quite bluntly about Isaac’s own sense of bleak pessimism when exposing a severed tree, the universe’s sacred sign of life and birth. Through the perfect rendering of this encapsulated moment, Isaacs demonstrates the strength of the sculptural artifact and his interest in failure and fragility. It also denotes that a sculpture is capable of giving off a very emotive and sensory feeling in an instant– the crisp snap of life through the metaphor of the break of the tree.","John Isaacs’ work encompasses many different media, though much of it has origins in sculpture. The artist continually redefines his style, moving seamlessly through installation, sculpture, photography, film, painting and drawing. Whatever the media, Isaacs’ pieces typically inspire contemplation. Whether it is a grotesquely real, severed arm with the word HATE tattooed across its knuckles, or a small, painterly ink drawing of a unicorn, the artist’s work always contains a thread of mystical wonder and brutish reality. Through his often humorous mixing of appealing optimism with abject pessimism, Isaacs examines our historically and culturally determined conventions. In so doing, the artist makes no distinctions between high and low, finding instead that all things have their root in the same base instincts. In his work, there is a strong sense of the universal connection that underlies our apparent isolation from one another as well as the presence of dreams, successes and failures of the individual and society.

Fabrice Hyber,"The works of Fabrice Hyber provoke divergent ways of thinking. In a kindred spirit with Raymond Hains, image and writing are intertwined. Drawings and diagrams are visually direct, as shown in the series of “Peintures Homéopathiques” (“Homeopathic Paintings”), collages covered in transparent resin (1986-1988). In Cellman (2003) on the bottom right, stones and the arrows refer to skipping stones of “thinking”. A recurring human figure, commonly associated with Hyber’s theatrical world, is shown in Cellman and also L’homme de Bessines (1990). The artist uses writing as an engine of formal and semantic associations (“galet, galette, cellman, bulle, cellule “). The figure recalls that the body is a collection of cells. Like in the work Artère, le jardin des dessins ( Artery, the garden of drawings, a monument commissioned by Sidaction, Parc de la Vilette, Paris), the artist captures the inner workings of the body through schemas.","In each of his self-portraits, Fabrice Hyber (he removed the last “t” in Hybert in 2004) is elusive. This has been expressed in the photo “C’est le moment de se préparer à de nouvelles expériences” (It’s time to prepare for new experiences) (1987), or when we look at the upside down, hanging by one foot in “Traduction, le plus gros savon du monde” (Translation, the biggest soap in the world) (1991). “I? am an alien! ” says the artist. “Games and shifts are the only things able to face any kind of fundamentalism. Trade, commerce, image and poetry are means of osmosis. Through them gradually you can set up all of the ways to increase life beyond death. It is necessary to mix time, upgrade products, and imagine that works die in order to be assimilated then revisited. A work is absolutely not precognitive but always from here” said Fabrice Hyber in conversation with Thierry Laurent. Fabrice Hyber was born in 1961 in Luçon, France.

Deimantas Narkevicius,"The Dud Effect is a film that revisits the fear of nuclear attacks during the Cold War by staging the firing of a R-14 missile by a solitary soldier on the site of a real Soviet launch base installed in Lithuania. For this film, Deimantas Narkevicius used no animation or 3D effects, instead it is the silence of the place interrupted by the voice of the Russian soldier (who truly served on a military base in Lithuania) that creates this worrying atmosphere in which the execution of such an act becomes possible. The War Game (1965) by Peter Watkins was a source of inspiration, since he displays a personal and collective concern about the danger of the nuclear arms race in the United Kingdom in the 1960s.","Deimantas Narkevicius is a key figure in the Lithuanian art scene today. He has had many important retrospective exhibitions, at the Reina Sofia, Van Abbemuseum and Kunsthalle Bern, and he represented Lithuania at the 2001 Venice Biennale. He received the Vincent Award with Francis Alys in 2008. Trained as a sculptor, Deimantas Narkevicius then developed his work towards narrative through film and video. He considers History as central to his practice, as live material; he plays on the double meaning of the term history, by relating his personal story with that of his country. As witness to the dismantling of the Soviet bloc and the radical changes to society after the declaration of independence, Deimantas Narkevicius concentrates on the evocation and deconstruction of this heritage. Once in the XX Century (2005) has become emblematic of his work. There are images of Lenin, suspended above a crowd in Vilnius, which were shown a thousand times on CNN in the last ten years as symbolic of the collapse of the Soviet Union and the failure of Communism. But the manipulation operated during the editing process makes it seem as though the crowd is waiting and celebrating the installation of Lenin’s sculpture. « Therefore there is something frightening in the possible repetition of a past that isn’t so distant. » Deimantas Narkevicius. These films retrace the history of a country via a variety of places and portraits : a power plant, an abandoned nuclear missile base, a woman who survived the Vilnius ghetto, the official sculptor of Marx’s effigy, the Lithuanian actor Donatas Banionis filmed 40 years after his appearance in the film Solaris by Tarkovskij. Deimantas Narkevicius deconstructs the linearity of history. The narrative belongs both to the past and the present which is emphasized by the use of techniques and stylistic principles typical of amateur films of the 1970s. These fictional documentaries are made with old equipment rather like what was used to make propaganda cinema during the Soviet era, but the distance permitted by fiction allows him to bring the discourse up to date.Deimantas Narkevicius was born in 1964 Utena, Lithuania.

Martin Boyce,"In the installation Our Love is like the Flowers, the Rain, the Sea and the Hours, Martin Boyce uses common elements from public gardens – trees, benches, trashbins– in a game which describes at once a social space and an abstract dream space. The trees, unique sources of light in the exhibition space, produce their own environment. These sculptures, as if extracted from a set, are enough to suggest an atmosphere, a landscape, or a movie. Their nocturnal depiction is ambivalent, hovering between poetic beauty and the potential threat of a park at night. Romantic views of nature blend with modern ideas of optimism and equality. However, from it emerges from a deep anxiety or paranoia. The perceived space cannot be localized inside a certain reality, rather it pertains to the everyone’s imagination. Therefore, in the installation, the viewer produces what he sees around him with his own eyes and own journey through the space. Its space becomes the psychological and emotional space of an idler. When describing the piece, Boyce has stated that the sculptures move far from the visible and the material generating more of an emotional state rather than theoretical reflection.  “My installations draw upon imaginary and fragmented landscapes. When I introduce an object within an installation, it recalls the world from where it is derived from, like a fragment, it is a exploded variation.” The universe of Martin Boyce is multifarious, extracting fragments of reference as varied as architecture, design, cinema, Scottish literature, Japanese poetry, etc. His forms do not fit perfectly within one category and exist more as ghosts of meaning. For instance, a sculpture can distinctly resemble a tilted ping-pong table although all the elements deviate from such a table to a great extent. Concrete trees by Joel and Jan Martel made in 1925 for the Decorative Arts Exhibition in Paris are a recurrent theme throughout the work of Boyce, as well as replicas in “Electric trees and telephone booth” (2006) and formal traces in works such as “We are still and reflective” (2007). The artist sees these objects as a perfect “collapse” between architecture and nature. The sculptures, consisting of trees, gates, vents, signs, dot the exhibition space, becoming a stage. While the forms and materials from were conceived to be functional, Martin Boyce uses them less as objects of representation and more as objects of emotion. Their titles, extracted from fragments of poems, pop songs, slogans, exist as a way to “inhabit” the installations and poeticize the real.","“My installations draw upon imaginary and fragmented landscapes.

Ceal Floyer,"NO POSITIONS AVAILABLE is composed of panels covering the entire wall of the gallery exemplifying one of the tendencies of the artist. The “billboard sign,” like a ready-made, plays with the different meanings of the title, literally and abstractly. The repetition of the sign, as it has used in Minimal and Conceptual art, fills the space. On a more abstract level, Floyer like Jonathan Monk and Mario Garcia Torres, explores the possibility of reformulating historical proposals from the 60s and 70s. Depending on the context and placement of the work, this work takes into account a socio-political reality,referring to unemployment and lack of work. This elliptical work makes sense only in the network of meanings produced by its activation in the exhibition.

Katinka Bock,"«I will put two heavy stones in my jacket pockets that way my body will sink deep like a deflated truck tire, no one will notice», this excerpt from “Quay West” by Koltès could echo the story depicted by Katinka Bock: the shipwreck of a small boat full of stones. The grain of the image and the framing evoke distant times, maybe the origins of cinema and the footage of the Lumière brothers. The operator’s gaze creates a landscape undetermined in space and time. An encounter between density and liquid: the effect produced is strange and paradoxical since the rocks are floating, temporarily denying gravity. It is also an aesthetic study of the liquid and the mineral, a confrontation between the fluid and the rough, a combination of the wave and the shape.","The city, the landscape and the exhibition space are Katinka Bock’s favored playgrounds. Her installations, sculptures, films and photographs question the spaces of action and representation, in their daily and political use, through the prism of aesthetics and poetry. Katinka Bock makes changes to the landscape. In « Sol d’incertitude » (2006) the artist removes (Parisian cobblestones), quotes (a history of mobility), and modifies (tar coating). These actions function as small rituals. « Das Konservat » (2003), a 3 meter high wooden fence enclosing 2500 square meters of grass, acts like a cutting in the landscape, reminiscent perhaps of the ‘temenos’ (in Ancient Greece, sacred space in open air dedicated to a god).  Although Bock’s objects are visually mute, they tell stories. For the exhibition « Kanon » (La Synagogue de Delme, 2008), a drama of materials occurred; the sculptures were transformed into still lives, with a fragile monumentality.

Her installations, sculptures, films and photographs question the spaces of action and representation, in their daily and political use, through the prism of aesthetics and poetry. Katinka Bock makes changes to the landscape. In « Sol d’incertitude » (2006) the artist removes (Parisian cobblestones), quotes (a history of mobility), and modifies (tar coating). These actions function as small rituals. « Das Konservat » (2003), a 3 meter high wooden fence enclosing 2500 square meters of grass, acts like a cutting in the landscape, reminiscent perhaps of the ‘temenos’ (in Ancient Greece, sacred space in open air dedicated to a god).  Although Bock’s objects are visually mute, they tell stories. For the exhibition « Kanon » (La Synagogue de Delme, 2008), a drama of materials occurred; the sculptures were transformed into still lives, with a fragile monumentality.  Katika Bock was born in Frankfurt am Main in 1976.

Michal Chelbin,"Michal Chelbin’s staged yet intimate portrait photographs, seduce the viewer into uncomfortable, voyeuristic complicity with the camera. Several works represent adolescent girls on the verge of sexual consciousness, their bodies still that of a child while their gaze directly confronts the viewer implying differently. Michal Chelbin shoots in a format of utter stability-the square. She positions her subjects well within the frame where visual clarity prevails. Angelina and her father, Israel belongs to the “Strangely Familiar” series where she shifted form shooting in the studio to the outside world, from theatrical to found light. In this work, an athletic but vulnerable-looking man holds his daughter in front of a swamp, poised as if offering her to the viewer.  Though the photographs remain staged and her efforts directorial, Chelbin has sublimated the work’s mythic aspects by exploring a world of characters that lend themselves readily to the romantic-the world of athletes, ballroom dancers, and performers in small traveling shows and circuses, mostly in Eastern Europe, but also in Israel and England. With little supporting information to go on, we reflexively fill in the blanks and ride the images’ narrative momentum wherever it leads. Much of the time taking us to places steeped in discontinuity, incongruity, ambiguity.

Jordan Wolfson,"Dreaming of the dream of the dream is a 16mm projection consisting of images of waves that come and go continuously. The artist has assembled extracts of cartoons in which water is visible (the sea, bubbles, a stream, waves, etc.). Somewhat nostalgic, these extracts can recall either childhood cartoons or paintings by Hokusai. The continuous movement of the waves echoes the presentation of the film which also loops: a metaphor of life, a cyclical and continuous movement which nevertheless cannot be altered. The more the film is shown, the more the images become worn. The images progressively disappear with the scratches on the print. In fact, the work itself has a limited lifespan since the artist insists that the film should never be copied and that it should be shown until the images have entirely disappeared. Once the work is ‘dead’, only documentation will remain as in the case of a performance. Even though the images are the same, everyone has a different experience of the work until it erases and self-destructs completely only to remain in our memory.","Jordan Wolfson is often defined as a romantic conceptualist indeed his work tends to subvert material conditions of the art world and question contemporary socio-cultural or religious stereotypes with a great deal of highly strung melancholy, humor or cynicism. Between fact and fiction, Wolfson’s practice involves film, text and graphics, sound and animations. The poetic forms arrived at are ambiguous, tautological and often anxiously psychological constructs. He scrutinizes popular culture for his pinpointed iconoclastic artworks. Some of his now famous references are to Charlie Chaplin, Michael Jackson, Christopher Reeve, Rodgers and Hammerstein lyrics, Eric Satie’sGymnopédie, the Semite.

Matti Braun,"During a residency in 2009 at L’appartement 22 in Rabat, the artist traveled in Morocco and Senegal on the traces of the German sculptor Arno Breker. On this occasion he learned about batik, a fabric printing technique which originates not only from Indonesia but also from Senegal. It is also widespread in Africa. The artist was inspired by the printed motifs to make a series of batiks, Untitled, on which the white on black motifs recall European geometric abstraction. By re-appropriating these handcrafted traditional techniques (batik, Japanese ink and wash, blown glass, woodcuts, painting on ceramic…) Matti Braun displaces their usage and their context at the same time and reveals the porousness between different cultures that interpenetrate. Thus the artist aims to shed troubled light on different histories by operating these correspondences between forms and past knowledge, present and future.","Matti Braun’s work entails research and experienced wanderings during sojourns and journeys. He explores heterogeneous data. Their junction generates rapports with other geographic and cultural eras, sometimes in anachronistic ways. Matti Braun is interested in different cultures and particularly in the multiple physical and conceptual migrations they have experienced. The creative process results in in-depth research regarding the interpretations about these different cultures.

Anna Molska,"Perspective was filmed during a residence in northern Poland. The film is preceded by a series of photographs made ??in her studio. In a snowy landscape, the artist walks towards the horizon secured by ropes. The film records the appearance of a geometric construction that unfolds in space, but also the physical effort of the artist to create it. Finally, she reaches a climax when the strings form a perspective on the landscape. At the same time, freed from the studio, but still a prisoner of the ropes, the more she walks, the space extends further.  The piece features a physical struggle to reach the horizon, and the ideal point where the hypothetical perspective lines meet. The film reveals the impossibility of art to reflect both dimensions in a two-dimensional space as if the perspective tools developed in the Renaissance are no longer allowed to read the world.","Anna Molska uses video performance to explore the effect of artistic culture on the production of art. She rethinks the historical traditions of the Russian-Polish avant-garde in a question of the role of the artist who, beyond the organization of forms in space, participate in the construction of society. She questions the validity of art tools to produce new concepts and territoires.  Anna Molska was born in 1983 in Prudnik, Poland.

Laurent Montaron,"This film refers directly and fictionally to one of the first media dramas: the burning of the Zeppelin aircraft LZ 129 Hindenburg as it landed in New York in 1937. The power of these images, which were widely diffused in the press, had a profound haunting impact on people’s consciousness. This mode of transport – both futuristic and obsolete – crystallizes a collective imaginary which was fed by cinematic, literary and mythological fiction as Barthes would put it. A mass advances progressively towards the spectator, the camera glides right up to this monster, which is as graceful as a sea mammal, but flames perturb this vision. The mass disappears from view, making it impossible to define clearly, and finally exits the image field. Realized with an anaglyph process – which superimposes two slightly offset images to produce an effect of depth – the film prevents the experience of the third dimension and emphasizes the tricks of fabrication since it is viewed without special glasses. Due to its materiality and blurriness, the image, which is accompanied by a sinusoid wave, exerts a powerful haptic and hypnotic fascination.","Using a variety of media – photography, film, sound, installation, sculpture – Laurent Montaron’s work ‘renders an image’ in Mélancolia (2005) the magnetic band of an echo chamber endlessly loops and unwinds to become a hypnotic serpentine line. ‘To render an image’ can be understood in the sense of crystallizing a set of archetypes and fantasies in a sensory mental representation. In the film Readings (2005), a researcher at the astronomical observatory in Meudon observes his bloody hand caused by the tooth he has just lost in a suspended space-time. “I would say that I construct my images like scenes in which the beginning and the end are missing, in which the scenario is contained in a very short lapse of time. They are often like a film still with no attached synopsis” according to Laurent Montaron. These images are formed within a time warp, a ‘rupture’ (Georges Didi-Huberman), a concept which is also present iconographically in BALBVTIO (2009, two identical films, shot differently, projected simultaneously). Each one of the artist’s works necessitates a particular attention span, different for every spectator.

Trevor Yeung,"“We both died at the same moment” is a humorous observation of anthropomorphism, the attribution of human emotions to nature and animals. A siliquaria armata is a slitworm that loosley-coiles a shell. Growing inside a sea-bed, a siliquaria armata will grow vertically until it touches another siliquaria armata, at which point they will knot together. Once caught by fishermen, the two worms die at the same time. Yeung undermines this romanticized phenomenon by emphasizing the emotionless in the process from the life to death of a slitworm. Yet while Yeung’s theoretical interrogation of life and death in nature and humankinds tendency to romanticize the unknown and the unknowable, “We both died at the same moment” simultaneously connotes a mythologisation of the slitworms. The vitrine, a showcase usually hosting Buddhist sculptures, common in Hong Kong, which houses the slitworm aggrandizes the phenomenon of dying at the same time of knotted siliquaria armata’s. “We both died at the same moment” puts into question the desire and tendency to romanticize nature, turning to a slitworm as a metaphor for beauty, life and death.","Trevor Yeung’s (b. 1988, Guangdong Province, China) practice, traversing a wide range of mixed media works from drawings and photographs, small objects and installations, is a delicate examination of human relations and processing. Using the human body, plants and animals as an aesthetic pretext to examine the processes of exchange and participation, Yeung projects emotional and intellectual scenarios onto biological substitutes. His allegory of the biological as the emotional interrogates the artificiality of nature and the capacity for a simulated construction of meaning. The artist creates worlds with their own logic, with his rules and that are connected to his own experiences. In doing so Yeung’s work invites his audiences to interrogate perspectives and challenge the creation of systems.

Ryan Gander,"A vehicle without light is a group of more personal photographs. This includes an image of a pirate radio in the 1960s, a story from the BBC website and the photo of Mary Aurore.

Kennedy Browne,"Milton Friedman on the wonder of the free market pencil is an installation based on 42 blank pages. On the first page, one can read the original version in English of the liberal speech by Milton Friedman on “The Story of the pencil”. On the other pages, the same text has been translated into 41 different languages by using Google Translate, before coming back to English. It is significant that Dublin, the artists’ home town, is also a centre for IT industries and the site of Google’s European offices. The final page becomes much shorter than the original text and it has been transformed into something raher incomprehensible. This work has not only an evident political and social dimension but also a poetic one: how a linguistic journey produces a loss of information but also leads to new interpretations. Kennedy Browne represented Ireland during the Venice Biennial in 2009, where this work was on view.","Kennedy Browne’s practice concerns itself with ways of temporarily occupying particular architectural fragments and cultural texts. Often they create incongruous territories between ‘real’ and artificial, politics and kitsch. The actors in their projects are concerned with global economics and natural resources, and as a series, these obscure cultural artefacts begin to re-trace an alternative historical trajectory linked to contemporary concerns.  Initiated in 2005, Kennedy Browne is the collaborative practice of Gareth Kennedy (b.1979) and Sarah Browne (b. 1981).

Clemens von Wedemeyer,"Die Siedlung is a filmic documentary about the recent shift in housing developments in Leipzig-Grünau in former East Germany and its consequences on some inhabitants. It complements von Wedemeyer slightly earlier and more artistic film Silberhöhe (2003) which decried imposed Modernist living model. In Die Siedlung, a voiceover describes and criticizes the different sites on view while the camera moves slowly past a vast abandoned 1930s Nazi army barracks which has yet to be converted or demolished, the building site and wastelands for the new private single family housing area, a constructed pond and finally the 1960s or 70s communal blocks of flats. An estate agent is recorded introducing the newer building site and its future plans in rather deadpan and unconvincing terms, according to him the Bauhaus concept has met resistance from the majority of buyers. A cynical jobseeker expresses his disgust faced with the notion of private property in an interview. The short piece quietly but efficiently denounces the blind pressures of “social reconditioning”. Von Wedemeyer’s work borrows from cinematic or documentary conventions (alike or separately) to analyze architecture as well as urban planning and their impact on behavior with great acuity.","Clemens Von Wedemeyer is certainly one of the artists of his generation that make intelligible our relationship to reality through the use of different transmissions of images, whether through film or video. The artist employs the documentary genre as a method in his analysis of reality. However, his use of fiction gives us the opportunity to examine different images. Referencing the work of Antonioni with “Silberhöhe”, he puts us in a genealogy of directors who have also questioned the complex relationship between fiction and reality. If the video “Silberhöhe” gives us clues to understanding some aspects of reality, the poetic dimension of the artifices of fiction offer more complex visions of the world.Clemens Von Wedemeyer was born in 1974 in Göttingen, Germany.

Toby Ziegler,"The Fifth Quarter might have taken its mysterious inspiration from the eponymous Stephen King story collated into the Nightmares & Dreamscapes collection. Various vanishing points and interior perspectives, like in another painting dated the same year called Continental Breakfast, create a complex matrix in which motifs, shadowy or geometric forms coexist to further confuse the map of this space. A disturbing yet alluring virtual reality composed of a medley of seemingly abstract designs is depicted through digital and painterly means. Architectural and landscape paintings in reflective metallic paints are characteristic of Ziegler’s work shown at the time in Archipeinture at Le Plateau, Paris and Camden Arts Centre, London in (2006) and in his solo show Enter Desire at Chisenhale Gallery, London (2005). He was then known for using an industrial phosphorescent material called Scotchlight for its contemporary glow in order to blur distinctions between reality and representation.","Toby Ziegler is a British artist whose work first came to view in an exhibition called Expander in 2004. His paintings are based on photographs that he digitally manipulates to render them more abstract. His sculptures are closer to being figures and it is in a figurative direction that his painting is now going. These sculptures, therefore, are important transitional works. Most of Ziegler’s sculptures are made out of cardboard or paper and covered in numerals which he employs to piece them together. Like the paintings, the sculptures emanate from digital images. He uses computer-aided design to generate line drawings and then, with scissors and glue, pieces them together. The forms of his sculptures have a relationship to Cubism, whose spatial complexity Ziegler admires, and perhaps also De Kooning for their sexual overtones. The numerals make oblique reference to his father’s mania for indexing and cataloguing but are also used in scaling up the works.Toby Ziegelr was born in 1972 in London.

Toby Ziegler,"Wagon Wheel is a work with a fundamental dynamism that derives both from the rotating movement of the elements suspended on poles and the kicking of the legs of the figure. It is based on a pornographic image by Giulio Romano (ca.1499-1546). Romano had completed Raphael’s frescos in the Vatican after the latter’s death but was not paid for the work. Ziegler relates how in revenge Romano drew pornographic images on the buildings of the Vatican. The Pope erased them but Marcantonio Raimondi (ca. 1480-1534) turned the images into prints, a series called « I Modi », which were widely circulated in Rome and for which he was jailed. The Pope, realising they brought him into disrepute, gathered them all together and destroyed them. Other artists had copied them, however, and such copies exist in the British Museum.  Wagon Wheel is the first sculpture of the figure that Ziegler made. He has since moved into figurative painting but he states that he could not have done this without making sculpture first. He believes this particular work is crucial to that development. It was inspired not only by the Romano prints, but also by seeing a sculpture of hands by Rodin. He feels that most of Rodin’s sculptures are too complete for him to be able to work off them. But the sculpture of a hand fired his imagination because of its incompleteness.  Wagon Wheel also relates to the sculpture of Ancient Greece which is frequently displayed as a compilation of fragments, with armatures supporting disparate parts and acting as surrogate limbs or body parts.","Toby Ziegler is a British artist whose work first came to view in an exhibition called Expander in 2004.

Bruno Pacheco,"En Guard Souvenir is composed of a group of eleven elements (ten paintings on paper and a sculpture) which deconstructs and recomposes the context of Tienanmen Square in Beijing. This square is known for numerous political events : the cultural revolution between 1966 and 1976, the arrest of the Gang of Four and protests in 1989 where thousands of demonstrators who were protesting against the corruption of the regime were killed. In this work, Bruno Pacheco alludes to the historical importance of this place, the choice of viewpoints reveals very precise but sporadic details there : part of the mausoleum devoted to Mao, a portrait of him and its frame, a view overlooking the Forbidden City, etc. On the square, two guards stand on their platform, facing each other, executing their rituals. The installation leads one to think about various angles of approach within a historical discontinuity.  With a certain spontaneity, Bruno Pacheco crystallizes the gestures of the characters (guards) in his paintings. The different viewpoints are organized in order to construct a rhythmic visual narration. The sculpture is to be perceived at the centre point of the installation, it is the platform also found in the paintings though this one is empty, figuring the absence for the guard and require the public’s projection in order to understand the participation of this object within the installation. The artist’s cinematographic approach places an emphasis on form, frame and color in order to open a dialogue about the deconstruction of this site through this sequential and fragmentary mode. The worrying distance which is created develops a distinct form which alludes to the unfathomable chasm between memory and reality, private and public space. This work reveals the artist’s political commitment and his interrogation regarding the individual within the collective.","Painting is at the center of the artist Bruno Pacheco’s practice.

Taysir Batniji,"Fathers #18 and Fathers #27  is part of a series of photographs and videos made in recent years in Gaza. Batniji addresses the representation of the over-identified human and physical space with the geographical and political situation in the region. He distinguishes himself from the fictions that have been previously created in the Middle East and offers a quieter and more retained vision of the of the intertwining tensions and oppositions in this area.  Fathers offers an incomplete inventory of portraits that we often see framed and hanging on the walls of cafes, stalls, shops, workshops and other workplaces in Gaza and the Middle East. Often old and yellowed, sometimes dusty and slanted, these portraits rarely have links to the current owner and they relate instead to the person who founded the place and who left long ago. Since these places are overloaded with symbols and signs of presence (s) and disorder (s) but devoid of human inhabitants, or their owners, they become a particular paradigm of some sort of “still life”. This kind of places seem full (of products, objects, memories and signs of life) and empty at the same time. By overlooking different temporalities, memory and regards, or by being petrified, like ruins after a disaster that nobody will ever know,  they belong to the present and to the past.

Milena Bonilla,"Milena Bonilla’s discursive practice explores connections among economics, territory, and politics through everyday interventions. Her drawings, sculptures, and photography are active investigations into our often-fallible notions of history. Stone Deaf (2009) is a direct intervention into Karl Marx’s gravesite, for which the artist literally traced the history of Marx’s grave. She traveled to Highgate in London seeking the gravesite, only to find a plaque stating that Marx’s remains had been removed in 1954 to another part of the cemetery. She discovered that this had taken place at the behest of the British Communist Party, and that the deceased was now in a more prominent location, marked with a bust and a monument. Bonilla’s rubbing of the original plaque celebrates an anti-monument, so to speak, calling into question Marx’s life and legacy.","Milena Bonilla’s discursive practice explores connections among economics, territory, transit, and politics through everyday interventions. Her drawings, sculptures, installations, videos, texts, public interventions, and photographs are active investigations into our often-fallible notions of history. The artist’s current practice involves explorations of knowledge interpreted as a work force, and of nature as an entity colonized by language, consumed on a massive scale through images. For the last decade or so, Bonilla’s work has specifically explored the dichotomy of the Aristotelian categories of physis (nature) and logos (reason). The artist’s impulse to exert control over this relationship results in political armatures that ultimately seek to limit interactions between living systems, and to confront our biases regarding the relationships between thought and action.",Stone Deaf,Unspecified,"['intervention.n.01', 'history.n.01', 'tag.v.01', 'probe.n.01', 'remove.v.01', 'district.n.01', 'connection.n.01', 'politics.n.01', 'london.n.01', 'location.n.01', 'direct.a.01', 'rock.n.01', 'photography.n.01', 'original.s.01', 'practice.n.01', 'everyday.s.01', 'impression.n.01', 'question.n.01', 'drawing.n.01', 'sculpture.n.01', 'life.n.01']","['monument.n.02', 'marxism.n.01', 'displacement.n.06', 'intervention.n.01', 'prominence.n.01', 'politics.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/milena_bonilla_stone_deaf2.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/milena_bonilla_stone_deaf2-200x300.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/stone-deaf/,"['Politics/6.958773252890899', 'Society/4.202614379084967', 'Material_Physical/1.6985294117647058']","['Politics', 'Society', 'Material_Physical']",12.859917043740573,"['Politics/4.411764705882352', 'Economy/2.3790849673202614', 'Geopolitics/1.7777777777777777']","['Politics', 'Economy', 'Geopolitics']",8.56862745098039,"['Material_Physical/28.73094683094684', 'Society/24.031491057961652', 'Cultural/20.063266575186088']","['Material_Physical', 'Society', 'Cultural']",72.82570446409458,"['Land/10.697191697191698', 'Urbanization/10.417582417582418', 'Space/9.693162393162394']","['Land', 'Urbanization', 'Space']",30.80793650793651,0.6666666666666666,0.0

His practice merges object design, the use of industrial and everyday materials, text, and images, seeking to explore both the internal and the external relationships objects have with the spaces around them.

Wong Hoy Cheong,"Re: Looking marks a new phase in Wong’s work which connects his region’s history with other parts of the world. The video—located in an imagined contemporary Malaysian middle-class living room, a space of a fictive former imperial power—explores the precarious link between fact and fiction, fakery and authenticity by overlaying three believable, authoritative forms: a documentary, a website, and a realistic reconstruction of a contemporary home. It is rife with occidental colonial documents and exotic cultural artifacts—the trophy-evidence of Empire-making. The video parodies television networks and documentaries as researched authoritative forms of information. It begins by posing as a serious, believable work of non-fiction, but becomes increasingly unsettling with its inclusion of fictive events, memories, and histories around the urgent contemporary problems of migration, racism, power relationships, and empire making.","Born in Malaysia, Wong Hoy Cheong’s work examines the formation of his country’s multicultural identity vis-à-vis global migration, trade, colonialism, and the postcolonial circulation of people, ideas, and capital. His extended body of work uses various media—drawing, painting, performance, installation, video, and on-line projects—to critique the impact of these developments on contemporary life within and without South Asia.

Eko Nugroho,"Nugroho’s installations and performances have their roots in the shadow puppet rituals in Indonesia, particularly the Javanese Wayang tradition whose essence is in the representation of the shadows. Nugroho’s work both preserves traditional culture and offers a contemporary interpretation of it through his insertion of comical figures to comment on current social conditions. Moving Landscape includes characters such as a diamond-headed man, a UFO, and other items that appear frequently in Nugroho’s drawings and murals. The shadows and silhouettes rotate in a custom-made, lit tent structure to create a fantasy world that blurs the line between daily life and fiction. The narratives here are complex and ambiguous and speak to a range of psychological states that echo everyday reality.","Working with a variety of media including comics, animation, mural painting, graffiti, embroidery, video, and puppetry, Yogyakarta-based artist Eko Nugroho comments on social justice, cultural tradition, and the human condition. The concepts, materials, and strategies of his oeuvre reflect a sophisticated understanding of “fine art,” crafts, as well as street art. For example, Nugroho’s use of embroidery is inspired by local street gangs whose jackets are embroidered with their logos and by the embroidered badges worn by local government officials to announce their affiliations. After the Indonesian Reformation in 1998, Nugroho started to use caricature in his work to criticize the government’s policies about democracy, freedom, and censorship.

Minouk Lim,"New Town Ghost (2005) is one of Lim’s trio of large-scale video installations. (The other two are S.O.S—Adoptive Dissensus [2009] and The Weight of Hands [2010].) The series grew out of her interest in capturing lost memories and the collective unconscious in rapidly globalizing cities such as Seoul. New Town Ghost documents a young female activist who is standing aggressively on a truck, rapping slam poetry through a megaphone to the rhythm of a nearby drummer. The two performers are from the Yeongdeungpo district, which has been drastically transformed by development from an industrial zone into a “new town” full of giant department stores and mega-brands. Yeongdeungpo is symbolic of many transformations witnessed by a young generation of Koreans. For Lim it is a dystopian place where the idea of a better future is simply delusional.

Jompet Kuswidananto,"Third Realm (2011) grew out of the artist’s long-term research of Indonesia’s colonial history and the processes of modernization and urbanization that have taken place there. Kuswidananto describes the nation as perpetually in an “in-between” state of transition. Thus he has developed the concept of a third reality, third space, or third body—an identity specifically for Indonesia that reflects its spatial realities and national character. The uniforms and horse saddles in the installation are of the type used in festival parades. Instead of directly commenting on colonial military history, the ghostly and bodiless outfits hauntingly suggest something out of the past. The addition of video and sound exacerbates this effect. This highly theatrical work not only reenacts traditional mythology but also foregrounds its unstable nature. It is intended to represent a shifting and changing milieu of ideas, events, performances, and meanings.","Inspired by Indonesia’s complex social history, political identity, ideologies, and culture, as well as his training as a musician, Jompet Kuswidananto makes multimedia installations that often combine video, sound, and mechanized elements. His research-based practice has its own unique language. Kuswidananto is closely connected to local communities in Yogyakarta, and many of his projects are realized through in-depth collaborations. His work has been included in the 3rd Fukuoka Asian Art Triennale (2005), the Yokohama Triennale (2008), the Jakarta Biennale XIII (2009), the 10th Biennale de Lyon (2009), and the Kuandu Biennale (2010).",Third Realm Venice Series #2,Unspecified,"['world.n.03', 'history.n.01', 'horse.n.01', 'type.n.01', 'represent.v.01', 'passage.n.01', 'concept.n.01', 'state.n.04', 'military.a.01', 'traditional.a.01', 'sound.n.01', 'identity.n.01', 'event.n.01', 'nature.n.01', 'meaning.n.01', 'performance.n.01', 'procedure.n.01', 'idea.n.01', 'fictional_character.n.01', 'space.n.01', 'video.n.01']","['indonesia.n.01', 'between.r.02', 'urbanization.n.02', 'haunted.s.03', 'nation.n.02', 'transition.n.03']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/jompet_kuswidananto__third_realm_venice_series_2__mixed_media_two_life_size_figures_2011.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/jompet_kuswidananto__third_realm_venice_series_2__mixed_media_two_life_size_figures_2011-300x225.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/third-realm-venice-series-2/,"['Material_Physical/6.263549522373052', 'Society/5.779084967320261', 'Politics/2.6333333333333333']","['Material_Physical', 'Society', 'Politics']",14.675967823026646,"['Land/4.571241830065359', 'Urbanization/4.179084967320261', 'Politics/1.0']","['Land', 'Urbanization', 'Politics']",9.75032679738562,"['Individual_Personal/37.919850084555975', 'Cultural/29.18847018994079', 'Society/15.457978279030915']","['Individual_Personal', 'Cultural', 'Society']",82.56629855352767,"['Mind/10.139366515837105', 'Culture/9.541758241758243', 'Values/9.355067155067156']","['Mind', 'Culture', 'Values']",29.036191912662503,0.3333333333333333,0.0
Jianwei Wang,"In Dilemma: Three Way Fork in the Road, Wang references Peking opera in a re-interpretation of traditional text. The performance begins with two broad-knife-wielding characters circling each other in conventional operatic steps. Oblivious to the presence of these two on stage, additional characters, in a mix of period costume and contemporary dress, enter the stage in increasing droves to consume a various of foods laid out on a table until they collapse and pile on top of each other. Invoking the traditional Chinese theatrical trope of a “three-way fork in the road,” the piece ruminates on the representation of the visible and the invisible and the simultaneity of past and present as critical reflection on the shortcomings of both antiquarianism and technocratic modernity.","Born in Sichuan Province, China in 1958, Wang Jianwei was trained as a painter at the Zhejiang Academy of Fine Arts (current China Academy of Fine Arts) in Hangzhou. Despite displaying technical virtuosity as a painter, Wang chose a working method that combines video, film and theater. Interested in combining the mundane, the historical, and the mythological, Wang’s works range from depicting the “plight of peasants occupying an abandoned housing project in Sichuan Province to films of post-1949 China during the height of Communist fervor and stories from the Tang Dynasty.” Particularly, poignant is the cognitive dissonance formed between presentations of the past and present in Wang’s work.","Dilemma, three way of fork in the road",Asia,"['phase.n.01', 'traditional.a.01', 'fictional_character.n.01', 'table.n.01', 'put.v.01', 'time_period.n.01', 'critical.a.01', 'contemplation.n.02', 'visible.a.01', 'representation.n.01', 'presence.n.01', 'contemporary.s.01', 'performance.n.01', 'piece.n.01']","['invisible.a.01', 'dramaturgy.n.01', 'simultaneity.n.01', 'chinese.a.01', 'opera.n.01', 'modernity.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/wang_jianwei_dilemma.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/wang_jianwei_dilemma-300x200.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/dilemma-three-way-of-fork-in-the-road/,"['Cultural/5.2153846153846155', 'Society/0.9333333333333333']","['Cultural', 'Society']",6.148717948717949,"['Arts/1.7692307692307692', 'Media/1.6', 'History/0.9333333333333333']","['Arts', 'Media', 'History']",4.302564102564102,"['Individual_Personal/25.31099678615159', 'Cultural/11.17642286334237', 'Material_Physical/10.575671696724328']","['Individual_Personal', 'Cultural', 'Material_Physical']",47.063091346218286,"['Mind/8.397632372787172', 'Body/5.87062937062937', 'Spirituality/5.52991452991453']","['Mind', 'Body', 'Spirituality']",19.798176273331073,0.4,0.0
Gimhongsok,"To explore the boundaries between artwork and audience, Gimhongsok created a series of sculptural performances in which a person wearing an animal costume poses in the gallery. Bunny’s Sofa is a continuation of this series, but with a different twist. Instead of hiring a real person to dress as the animal, Gimhongsok placed a mannequin inside the rabbit costume. When exhibiting the work, the artist produces a false statement claiming that he has paid an illegal worker from North Korea to wear the suit and to maintain a lounging posture for a certain length of time. But both the performer and the financial transaction existed only in the text, truths concealed by the costume and social propriety. By interchanging physical realities and contexts and obscuring details, Gimhongsok challenges the effectiveness of visual and textual communication to create a potential moral anxiety in the viewers.","Raising questions about South Korea’s position in the world beyond its own social and political borders, Seoul-based artist Gimhongsok investigates communication, language, and popular culture. Gimhongsok’s ideas and deadpan satirical humor manifest themselves in many media and, because his creative process and personal style remain enigmatic, he is considered to be a “mysterious genius” in his homeland.

Melvin Moti,"“The Prisoner’s Cinema” is a phenomenon described in neurology as a hallucination, that appears after a prolonged absence of visual sensations. A blind screen of hallucinations forms itself on the eyes cut off from visual stimuli. The subject can see this projection, but fails to register these mental images, transforming it into an intimate and personal experience. In 1954, a scientist studied the syndrome of prisoners locked up in dark cells. This phenomenon is also common to truck drivers caught in a snowstorm. Melvin Moti is interested in the relationship between hallucination and formalism. Constant forms and geometric shapes appear on a recurring basis. A constant form is a form whose interpretation is not based on a cultural contingency, but that appears at different times and in different cultures, and forms no history and no future. The Prisoner’s Cinema consists of abstract images, rays of light through a window, and explanations of a scientist describing his vision after undergoing sensory deprivation for several days. This is about the origins of the film, creating an image of the power image of the subject, the unconscious, history of abstraction and formalism.","Scientific research, high and mass culture, and the processes of cultural production in contemporary society plays an important role in the work of Rotterdam-born artist Melvin Moti, currently based in Rotterdam and in Berlin. The artist whose practice traverses films, books, objects and drawing, enquires into the power of human imagination and abstraction, looking at how perception works neurologically and psychologically. His earlier works include a guided tour in the empty rooms of the Hermitage through memory (No Show, 2004), the human ability to make images appear on the retina from total darkness (The Prisoner’s Cinema, 2008) or the representation of the fourth dimension (The Eightfold Dot, 2013). The artist gives form to obscure anecdotes, incidents, and individuals — or, what he calls black holes — that he claims haven’t been contextualized by official history. Concerned with history and its influence in cultural production, Moti researched the Cosmists, an early twentieth century Russian group of thinkers responsible for Cosmism, the philosophical and cultural movement that combined occult and esoteric theories with space science. By comparing statistics, scientist and member of the Cosmists, Alexander Chizhevsky, discovered a correlation between solar activity (such as sunspots) and major historical events on earth (such as wars, revolutions, epidemics and natural disasters). In several studies Chizhevsky describes how one can observe an increase in wars, revolutions, and in epidemics on earth during years of high amounts of solar activity, while years with a low amount of solar activity correspond to a decrease of military and political events on earth. Chizevsky called this observed synchrony “historiometry”. While studying this history, Moti produced two works in 2015, a film Cosmism and a series of silk works, Cluster Illusion.",The Prisoner’s Cinema,Europe,"['film.n.02', 'phenomenon.n.01', 'changeless.s.02', 'form.n.01', 'subject.n.01', 'ocular.a.02', 'history.n.01', 'image.n.01', 'window.n.01', 'future.n.01', 'times.n.01', 'geometric.s.01', 'vision.n.01', 'eyes.n.01', 'common.a.01', 'abstraction.n.01', 'interpretation.n.01', 'screen.n.01', 'projection.n.01', 'personal.a.01', 'relationship.n.01', 'abstract.a.01', 'shape.n.01', 'beginning.n.04', 'power.n.01']","['formalism.n.01', 'hallucination.n.01', 'sensory_deprivation.n.01', 'sight.n.03', 'darkness.n.02', 'unconscious_mind.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/img-500_0.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/img-500_0-300x204.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/the-prisoners-cinema/,"['Individual_Personal/10.75004456327986', 'Society/4.23184641445511', 'Politics/2.506469979296066']","['Individual_Personal', 'Society', 'Politics']",17.488360957031038,"['Mind/5.8750445632798565', 'Violence/2.4753246753246754', 'Inequality/1.631469979296066']","['Mind', 'Violence', 'Inequality']",9.981839217900598,"['Individual_Personal/23.486685699921', 'Cultural/19.72929864253394', 'Material_Physical/16.10677100677101']","['Individual_Personal', 'Cultural', 'Material_Physical']",59.32275534922596,"['Time/10.236075036075038', 'Mind/9.817912806148101', 'Media/7.491905480140773']","['Time', 'Mind', 'Media']",27.54589332236391,0.3333333333333333,0.3333333333333333
David Maljkovic,"This video was filmed in the middle of the Zagreb fair which took place in the 1960s and 1970s under the rule of Tito. Tito created the fair to signify the exemplary economic exchange between the East and West. The film’s setting takes place at the Italian pavilion, where several young people are seen sitting in cars, trying to repeat sentences in English. The Zagreb fair initiative may have seemed positive for the development of trade with the world and a brighter future beyond the borders of their country, however, the tone, the monotony and repetition, without conviction of the same phrases reveals the absurdity of the situation. Politically, Croatia, in this time was a candidate for Europe.  Economically the country has been in a long recession with an uncertain future for new generations. Time is suspended, the outlook has been blocked for an indefinable period.","David Maljkovic is one of the most important figures in the Eastern Europe scene. His works seek to represent collective memory as well as amnesia, analyzing the transition from communism to capitalism in the recent history of Croatia. It reconsiders abandoned and obsolete architecture that appears to have disappearread overnight. When monuments announce better futures, they are also act as testimonies of a certain melancholy, in a complex reality, full of contradictions.

Pierre Leguillon,"End of 2008, Pierre Leguillon presented at Kadist Art Foundation the first retrospective of the works of Diane Arbus (1923-1971) organized in France since 1980, bringing together all the images commissioned to the New York photographer by the Anglo-American press in the 1960s. This exhibition, destined to tour in various locations, presents the original pages of the magazines, including ‘Harper’s Bazaar’, ‘Esquire’, ‘Nova’ and ‘The Sunday Times Magazine’. As Pierre Leguillon states on the exhbition’s publication: ‘The mythology surrounding Diane Arbus’ character is willingly set aside to offer a more neutral point of view on a more unfamiliar part of her work, although it was mass-distributed. Many of the characters portrayed in these commissioned works seem less sensational at first glance than the ‘freaks’ that made Diane Arbus’ work so famous, since the retrospective MOMA organized in 1973 in New York, two years after her suicide. And yet, “leafing through” all her contributions for the press, the Diane Arbus “method”, her installing the model in an environment in such a particular way, emerges obviously. Long sitting sessions, sometimes repeated, were destined to allow the model to « let go », while he never stopped fixing the camera, straight forward. It is no doubt their rigorous construction that enables these images, still today, to be contemporary.’","Pierre Leguillon is an artist who has developed projects as a curator and critic since the beginning of the 1990s, by creating a single page review, ‘Sommaire’ (35 issues between 1991 and 1996), then by collaborating to ‘Journal des Arts’, and ‘Art press’ (Special issue « Oublier l’exposition » in 2000), then to ‘Purple’ (column « Calme plat » about printed objects from 2002 to 2004).  In parallel, he has photographed many exhibitions, which he started reenacting in 1993 in slideshows, their content being each augmented and renewed for each session. In addition, he has often produced accompanying objects for these events. Since October 2008, he has opened in Bordeaux, at the Capc, a franchise of « La promesse de l’écran » (« The promise of the screen »), a screening space initiated in Paris in 2007.Pierre Leguillon was born in 1969, in Nogent-sur-Marne, France.

Claire Fontaine,"Foreigners Everywhere is a series of neon signs in several different languages. Named for Stranieri Ovunque, an anarchist collective from Turin, the work embodies and projects the ambivalence of their name into various sites and contexts. Lacking context, the neon suggests a factual statement, xenophobic threat, and evokes the estrangement of feeling foreign in a global society, a circumstance legible by the targeted populations.","Claire Fontaine is a Paris-based collective, founded in 2004. After lifting her name from a popular brand of school notebooks, Claire Fontaine declared herself a “readymade artist” and began to elaborate a version of neo-conceptual art that often looks like other people’s work. Working in neon, video, sculpture, painting and text, her practice can be described as an ongoing interrogation of the political impotence and the crisis of singularity that seem to define contemporary art today. But if the artist herself is the subjective equivalent of a urinal or a Brillo box – as displaced, deprived of its use value, and exchangeable as the products she makes – there is always the possibility of what she calls the “human strike.” Only two years old, Claire Fontaine uses her freshness and youth to make herself a whatever-singularity and a existential terrorist in search of subjective emancipation. She grows up among the ruins of the notion of authorship, experimenting with collective protocols of production, détournements, and the production of various devices for the sharing of intellectual and private property",Foreigners Everywhere (Italian),Europe,"['context.n.01', 'population.n.01', 'statement.n.01', 'global.s.01', 'language.n.01', 'sign.n.01', 'name.v.01', 'society.n.01', 'undertaking.n.01', 'series.n.01']","['language.n.01', 'alienation.n.01', 'authorship.n.02', 'struggle.n.03', 'anarchism.n.01', 'neon.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/img-330.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/img-330-300x129.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/foreigners-everywhere-italian/,"['Individual_Personal/6.217948717948718', 'Society/5.811735649970944', 'Politics/3.5']","['Individual_Personal', 'Society', 'Politics']",15.529684367919662,"['Emotion/6.217948717948718', 'Politics/3.5', 'Economy/2.587418300653595']","['Emotion', 'Politics', 'Economy']",12.305367018602315,"['Cultural/8.467210567210568', 'Politics/5.777777777777778', 'Individual_Personal/4.780566801619433']","['Cultural', 'Politics', 'Individual_Personal']",19.02555514660778,"['Language/3.4914529914529915', 'Fantasy/3.375757575757576', 'Politics/3.177777777777778']","['Language', 'Fantasy', 'Politics']",10.044988344988345,0.6666666666666666,0.3333333333333333
Felipe Arturo,"Primero estaba el mar (First Was the Sea, 2012) is a system of equivalences between syllables and silhouettes of waveforms cast in cement. Each waveform represents a syllable of the sentence “Primero estaba el mar.” This sentence is the first verse of the Kogui poem of creation. For the Koguis, an indigenous community from the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta on the Colombian Caribbean coast, water was the absolute presence before the creation of the universe. The Colombian writer Tomás González used this phrase as the title of his first novel, in which he narrates the story of a couple in Medellín who, following the anarchic and hippie trends of the 1970s, abandon civilization and move to a solitary beach. Instead of leaving modernity behind, however, the couple becomes a colonizing force, transforming the natural environment of the beach into a rationalized territory. Under the logic proposed by Primero estaba el mar, the variation of the order of the waveforms represents different possibilities for this sentence. The work produces eight different phrases that assimilate the idea of repetition and change; the sentence has eight syllables, and each syllable-waveform is repeated eight times in order to reconstruct the title eight different times, resulting in a total of sixty-four pieces.","Felipe Arturo considers elements from urbanism, architecture, and art in relation to politics, history, geography, and economy. His works and projects often manifest as sculptures, installations, or videos, departing from concepts such as structure, sequence, and matter. They are deeply influenced by vernacular architecture and construction techniques, and reflect processes of assimilation and resistance to colonial and postcolonial processes. He frequently combines the language and materials of Modernism (e.g., concrete) with the informal methods of autoconstrucción (self-construction).",Primero Estaba el Mar,Americas,"['phrase.n.01', 'creation.n.01', 'beach.n.01', 'times.n.01', 'title.n.01', 'variation.n.01', 'water.n.01', 'district.n.01', 'sea.n.01', 'writer.n.01', 'repeat.n.01', 'universe.n.01', 'community.n.01', 'possibility.n.01', 'environment.n.01', 'natural.a.01', 'presence.n.01', 'idea.n.01', 'narrative.n.01', 'piece.n.01']","['genesis.n.01', 'civilization.n.01', 'ocean.n.01', 'everyday.s.01', 'concrete.n.01', 'beginning.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/primero_estaba_el_mar_felipe_arturo_general_view_2012_web.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/primero_estaba_el_mar_felipe_arturo_general_view_2012_web-300x200.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/primero-estaba-el-mar/,"['Material_Physical/5.7435897435897445', 'Society/2.4475524475524475', 'Individual_Personal/1.5384615384615385']","['Material_Physical', 'Society', 'Individual_Personal']",9.72960372960373,"['Time/3.371794871794872', 'Physics/1.6025641025641026', 'Community/0.9090909090909091']","['Time', 'Physics', 'Community']",5.883449883449884,"['Individual_Personal/31.27619047619049', 'Material_Physical/29.279120879120885', 'Cultural/21.103310904781498']","['Individual_Personal', 'Material_Physical', 'Cultural']",81.65862226009287,"['Urbanization/9.356043956043957', 'Land/8.376556776556777', 'Spirituality/7.998168498168498']","['Urbanization', 'Land', 'Spirituality']",25.730769230769234,0.6666666666666666,0.0
Nicolás Consuegra,"A residency program in the blazing hot city of Honda, Colombia, inspired artist Nicolás Consuegra to consider the difficulty in understanding the needs of a distant community. An important town during the colonial era as the main port on the Magdalena River, Honda is presently rife with poverty, unemployment, and environmental deterioration. Here he produced the work Nadie sabe de la sed con que otro bebe (No one knows the thirst with which another drinks), a variable arrangement of cut glasses in front of a mirror so that they appear whole.

Asier Mendizabal,"Rotation presents the image of a crowd, a re-appropriation of 19th or beginning of 20th century photographs published in newspapers and magazines. This artwork is composed of the same image repeated four times with different resolutions. The last image in Rotation is less focused than the original one.  These pictures are low-angle shots, in a way that the subject is seen as part of a group rather than as an isolated person. This work denies the individual subject but also highlights the symbolic force of the masses.  The representation of crowds is a good means to highlight the way ideology creates forms. The photographic montage strategy – which is a process introduced by modernity – reveals an aspect of accumulation as well as fragmentation and destruction. Going from the top right to the bottom right, the image fades into becoming almost illegible and only the outline of the impression remains; as if identity whether it is national, political or ethnic was too difficult or impossible to represent.  This is a reference to popular culture and a reflection on collective gestures, the survival of rituals and the creation of a social landscape.","Asier Mendizabal explores political subjects and their symbols. His work is based on a formalist approach using abstract forms which recall Russian constructivism in painting, in sculpture as well as in cinema. He rethinks the relations between abstraction and the representation of politics.

Clément Rodzielski,"These photographs are installation shots of the exhibition De A à B, de B à P at Bielefelder Kunstverein (13 November 2010-30 January 2011). There, Clément Rodzielski had chosen to exhibit the series called Miroirs noirs (Black Mirrors, black and white abstract screen prints) which is emblematic of his work. The piece of painted wood was not shown to the public; it moves and invests the space enigmatically. On the other hand, the painting which dialogues with the works on the wall and serves as a yardstick in space has now disappeared. It only exists in and for the photographic images that keep a trace of its brief existence. The small painting had been entrusted to the exhibition photographer who was in charge of placing the work in the space while taking the pictures. The four photographs were presented at Confort Moderne (Poitiers) for the second incarnation of the exhibition (18 March-8 May, 2011).  In this work, Clément Rodzielski considers the exhibition-making process itself and includes the movement of artworks and of the exhibition space from Bielefeld to Poitiers. Protocols for the fabrication, the hang and the documentation constructs a production system which has been imagined for both exhibitions. The artist confronts the documentary qualities of the work produced this way (real exhibition shots/ the fictional intrusion of a “supplementary” object ; a black and white document which flattens the colored painting) choosing an imposing format, worthy of a photographic tableau : the whole installation thus recreates a  space in which we projects ourselves as one recalls that the artist’s practice is largely linked to in situ projects.","Like many artists of his generation, Clément Rodzielski (born in 1979 in Albi, France) is a well-informed onlooker who works with existing images in order to reveal their mechanisms of construction and circulation. But he concentrates in particular on images which are under our eyes but not seen any longer (motifs found on internet, murals in the urban settings) or don’t circulate (retro cinema posters). Based on these images, he isolates motifs or signs, multiplies different supports and gestures in order to reveal their  materiality (wallpainting, collage, cut-outs, photocopies, stencil, spray paint…) and reframe them so they can be seen better.

Imran Qureshi,"There was a tragedy in Sialkot, Punjab, in August 2010, when two adolescents were murdered by vigilantes who were apparently in connivance with the police. Struck by this blunder revealing police corruption, the started a series of paintings on paper, You who are my love and my life’s enemy too, in which he expressed his reaction to this murder. At first glance the work appears to be a splash of blood like the one in this killing, but, close up, the composition reveals itself as meticulous floral motifs typical of the art of miniature painting which the artist teaches. This work has echoes in another piece which was presented at the 10th Biennale of Sharjah, Blessing upon the land of my love, in which he develops an installation in a similar modus operandi, this time referring to a suicide bombing that took place in the market the artist goes to. These distinctive works confront us with the same feeling the artist had confronted with such violence, here Imran Qureshi poetically attempts to find a way to expiate these violent deaths and suggest their impacts on the political and social situation in Pakistan.","Imran Qureshi associates the aesthetic of Pakistani miniatures with political subjects on Pakistan toying with the public’s response to this type of painting which has precious and ancestral nature. Produced between 2006 and 2009, the Moderate Enlightenment series corresponds to this endeavor as he constructs these images on folkloric and traditional backgrounds and adds contemporary elements on the painted figure, often in the clothing codes (camouflage pants, sports shoes, umbrella …). This practice offers the artist’s viewpoint on contemporary Pakistan where friction between tradition and modernity and conflict are omnipresent.     Imran Qureshi was born in 1972 in Hyderâbâd, Pakistan.

Bettina Pousttchi,"For Bettina Poutsttchi’s large-format, site-specific photographic work Echo (2009–10), the four exterior walls of the Temporäre Kunsthalle Berlin were covered with a digitally edited collage of archival images of the glass-and-steel facade of the Palast der Republik (Palace of the Republic), which had once been located nearby. That milestone of late East European modernism was completed in 1976. It served as the seat for the Volkskammer—the parliament of the German Democratic Republic (GDR). After the fall of the Berlin Wall, the building lost its political purpose and was used for cultural initiatives. After a long political discussion, the building was demolished in 2009 to make room for the reconstruction of Berlin’s eighteenth-century Stadtschloss (City castle). With the aid of photography, Bettina Pousttchi rebuilt the Palace of the Republic, the historically important building in the immediate vicinity of the demolition site, thus raising questions of the eternal cycle of catastrophe, destruction, and reconstruction in Berlin.  Echo is a photographic work of an altered reality that is implemented in public space. The series of twenty-four color photographs was taken during the six-month presentation of Echo, offering a diverse portrait of this installation in the middle of the iconic buildings that surround it. With Echo, the artist altered the physical reality of the Berlin Schlossplatz through photographic means. By photographing it, she achieves another reality that crosses between architecture, sculpture, and photography in a very exciting way. A selection of the Echo photos were shown in her solo show at the Kunsthalle Basel in 2011. The proposal is to purchase a pair of photos showing the building at different times of the year and looking in different directions evoking different aspects of temporality and politics through the seasons and architecture.","In recent years Bettina Pousttchi’s work has dealt with themes related to memory, time and history and she is particularly interested in the consequences of the fall of the Berlin Wall. She makes sculpture, frequently made from crowd control barriers, video installations and photographs. She describes her work as coming out of photography. She also has an strong interest in architecture and its historical consequences. She was born in 1971 and studied in Dusseldorf under Rosemarie Trockel and Gerhard Merz. Like Amy Siegel, Pousttchi explores the relationship of Berlin’s Cold War past to its present in revealing ways. Bettina Pousttchi is an artist based in Berlin of German-Iranian origin.",Echo 8,Europe,"['berlin.n.01', 'building.n.01', 'reconstruction.n.01', 'photographic.a.01', 'world.n.03', 'architecture.n.01', 'photography.n.01', 'political.a.01', 'wall.n.01', 'photograph.n.01', 'calamity.n.01', 'pair.n.01', 'destruction.n.01', 'ageless.s.01', 'solo.n.01', 'presentation.n.01', 'politics.n.01', 'times.n.01', 'purpose.n.01', 'center.n.01', 'iconic.a.01', 'aspect.n.01', 'physical.a.01', 'collage.n.01', 'portrayal.n.01']","['architecture.n.01', 'memory.n.01', 'east_germany.n.01', 'government.n.01', 'demolition.n.02', 'cold_war.n.02']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/bpousttchiecho8_0.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/bpousttchiecho8_0-300x194.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/echo-8/,"['Material_Physical/6.925799346851978', 'Cultural/6.729298642533936', 'Society/5.764282577326055']","['Material_Physical', 'Cultural', 'Society']",19.419380566711972,"['Arts/2.6985294117647056', 'Land/2.6198830409356724', 'Mind/2.5384615384615383']","['Arts', 'Land', 'Mind']",7.856873991161916,"['Cultural/29.8728657994912', 'Society/26.379186755273714', 'Individual_Personal/18.467379988432626']","['Cultural', 'Society', 'Individual_Personal']",74.71943254319754,"['Arts/12.255324680479482', 'Culture/7.072527472527472', 'History/6.64047619047619']","['Arts', 'Culture', 'History']",25.968328343483144,0.6666666666666666,0.3333333333333333
Ciprian Muresan,"Ciprian Muresan asked a group of protagonists to wear a monk’s robe and copy a certain number of artworks and texts from exhibition catalogues. Here it is no longer the Bible that is reproduced but works by Malevich, Mondrian, Beuys, Duchamp. These artists represent a certain form of utopia in art and are themselves quasi-mythical figures. The fact that they are copying these works from a catalogue reproducing works by Elaine Sturtevant who in turn has appropriated work by other artists (mostly works made by men) creates an even greater distancing in the actions of these copying monks.  The authenticity of the artist’s gesture defended by Modernism is rejected and recalls the status of the artist during the Communist era. This also considers this post-Communist era in which artists easily enter the economic system of the art market in today’s globalized world and proposes an ironic comment on the diffusion of images in this internet age. Rather like in the work by Mladen Stilinovic, this is acts as an interrogation on the loss of meaning of certain icons in Western art, a questioning of the negative and positive consequences of a meticulous repetition of the past.","Ciprian Muresan appropriates historical, political, social and cultural (essentially artistic, literary and cinematographic) references which he re-contextualizes. He analyzes the mechanisms de diffusion of culture, the ambivalent relations between the memory of recent history and the experience of current realities, as well as the relations between political power, religious power and civil society. With simple gestures, themes and methods borrowed from popular culture, he tackles art in an expiatory manner, returning importance to personal expression and experience. Ciprian Muresan belongs to the generation after the fall of the former Communist regime who deal the aftermath of political and social history of his country, in a post-conceptual mode, without necessarily inscribing it within the traditional East/West opposition. Instead, on the contrary, he approaches this history as an integral part of a larger whole, and is interested in questions linked to the disturbances in contemporary society following the declining of Modernist utopias and in the impact of new technologies on our visual culture.

Lydia Gifford,"Lydia Gifford composes her work between pictorial expression and its inscription within an exhibition space. This particular approach implies the performative aspect of her in situ painting. The artist takes the entire environment into consideration from the canvas to the exhibition walls. Time and attention are required to allow the subtleties of the work to reveal themselves in all their complexities in order to find a focal distance which is appropriate to experience the composition. A white wall, a vibrant canvas, disparate elements as  punctuation, and the pictorial gesture that continue on the wall on which it becomes inscribed in an echo with the canvas. She explains that: “There is a subtle balance between impulse and action. Actions leave traces, painting always initially carries the mark of the body, of an explosive gesture.” Intimate and played out in the exhibition space, the artist’s work endangers its own apparatus on the occasion of every presentation and thus renews the viewpoints in a perpetual dialogue between the work, the place and the audience.  Warder is on the limit of achievement and creates a tension with the exhibition space that fundamentally participates in its evolution. The artist proposes an intimate sensory experience by drawing attention to the vibratile nature of the context and the marking of her gesture. She states that in her work: “Painting allows me to transpose boundaries”. In the painting tradition that Gifford responds to Turner’s works are haunted by fog which diffuses light: she brings this up to date with her incisive question of defining a territory to cultivate. Her work alludes to landscape, questions the appearing of a work of art and its existence, the trace of its emergence, the vitality of the initial thrust.",Lydia Gifford was born in 1979.

Mike Cooter,"Forensic Poster was first realized in 2006 and reactivated in 2011; its making consisted of the artist visiting the London School of Criminology and corresponding with the interim director there in order to reproduce a poster by memory. This piece of work is symptomatic of Cooter’s projects which are often arduous enterprises littered with pitfalls, since they imply prospecting and collaborating with third parties whose will determine the success of the project.   Forensic Poster consists of a letter, emails and a gouache which translates the artist’s attempt to recreate a poster glimpsed at in one of the study halls of the London Police Department of Forensic Medicine. Against a blood red background, the drawing simulates a manuscript note that has been pinned to the wall with a giant nail which carries the inscription: “Nail em”. At the bottom of the image, the injunction is completed by “With Good Forensics”. The dry formal rendering reinforces the smooth and aggressive message so that the spectator grasps that it caught the artist’s full attention. The rationale for the presence of the correspondence as part of the work isn’t so not much to allow the confrontation between his memory and the original, but to show his dialogue with London Forensics Police.  Mike Cooter’s  practice interrogates the place of the artist in society and his implication in reality, indeed in most of his projects he works with third parties et integrates them into the artistic process.","Mike Cooter’s practice interrogates the place of the artist in society and his implication in reality, indeed in most of his projects he works with third parties et integrates them into the artistic process.

Stephen Beal,"Beau Soleil #7’s title (translated as Beautiful Sun) gives a good sense of its effect. By virtue of a grid of dots, slightly different in size and placement, a subtle shimmering is created. In readily showing its effect as an image of light, the work exists between abstraction and representation—and perhaps points to the folly of such a distinction—rows and columns of spots become the dawn breaking through thick morning air.","Stephen Beal is a painter and the current president of California College of the Arts. His paintings are all-over patterns, resembling textiles or enlarged reproductions of printing technologies. In this sense, they seem to offer a bridge between Roy Lichtenstein’s hand-painted Ben-Day dots and modernist paintings’ dissolution of the distinction between figure and ground.

Doug Aitken,"The version of Frontier acquired by the Kadist Collection consists of a single-channel video, adapted from the monumental installation and performance that Aitken presented in Rome, by the Tiber River, in 2009. In this film, Aiken’s allusion to “the frontier” and iconic imagery like the cowboy suggest that the American West Coast as a cultural construction. These notions are reinforced by two key elements in the film: its protagonist, the iconic West Coast artist Ed Ruscha, and its reference to the cinematic and the experience of the movie theater. The film is structured as a journey in time, from day to night. The completed film was shot in different places around the globe, including Los Angeles, Rome, South Africa, and Israel, which suggests the blurring boundaries of the unknown and emphasizes both fictive and real landscapes.","Doug Aitken’s work started to draw international attention when his installation Electric Earth earned the International Prize at the 1999 Venice Biennale, which was organized by renowned Swiss curator Harald Szeemann. Interested in breaking conventional narratives, Aitken emphasizes circularity and non-linearity in his monumental site-specific installations. This monumentality is usually expressed in Aitken’s tendency to combine apparently disconnected fragments in order to create epic films. Although this aspect of his work differs from the all-encompassing wholes sought by modernism, Aitken’s films play with the imaginary and surreal in a way that flirts with  the notion of utopia. The artist uses pop culture and, especially, the film industry as sources for his compelling and immersive environments.

Alexis Smith,"Iron Sorrows (1990) brings together what are for Alexis Smith common motifs and materials such as scavenged and repurposed metal, and street signage. Iron is one of nature’s most abundant metals. Smith, a philosopher of human detritus and poetic associations, presents it in this work as simultaneously everywhere yet paradoxically forgotten, lost in the heaps of refuse that fill junkyards and vacant lots. She thereby recalls and reclaims something important and elemental—indeed, a material that is integral to the physical fabric of culture and society, one that we associate with incorruptibility and malleability simultaneously.","At a moment when Minimalism and Conceptual Art collided, Southern California-based Alexis Smith began working with discarded street signs, matchbooks, movie posters, and other detritus to become one of the pioneers of conceptual assemblage. Her cryptic comments on the cloudy morality of American culture are derived from pop cultural references including political figures like Richard Nixon, Hollywood films, and pop musicians.

Jeremy Deller,"Beyond the White Walls, with a commentary written and spoken by Jeremy Deller, is often wryly amusing. The artist narrates the many projects he has completed or which are in progress beyond the gallery walls. It is beyond the gallery where Deller is at his most effective and where his art reaches out to and into people’s lives. The tape slide presentation shows the extensive range of Deller’s work. On one level it is documentation, on another level it is a work that investigates the nature of a work of art – is a social project a work of art? When does documentation become art? Can we accept the artist’s commentary at face value?  The artist acts as a historian or archivist of his own work but presents it in such a way that the archive is the work of art itself. Deller is at one and the same time artist, curator and cultural historian interested in the way popular culture and fine art abut each other. His art has the capacity to affect directly people’s lives by inserting it into the community and requiring the community’s participation.","Jeremy Deller is one of the leading British artists working in film and making projects that grow out of an interest in vox pop, giving vent to the views of ordinary people and focusing on ordinary people’s lives. He seeks the involvement of the common man in the making of his work as well as focusing on events that have had a major impact on people’s lives. His most famous piece is a film called the Battle of Orgreave (2001) in which he produced and filmed a reenactment of an infamous confrontation between striking miners and the police force during the fateful miners’ strike that took place during Margaret Thatcher’s first term in office in 1984. In Deller’s restaging many of the participants were miners and policemen who had been present at the original event. Prior to that in 1996 Deller produced a work called Acid Brass for which he commissioned a brass band from the northern community of Stockport that would normally play traditional and often Christian songs, to play acid house and techno rock tunes. Brass Bands were closely associated with the collieries that were under threat from the conservative government’s closure of the coalmines. For Deller the Miners’ strike and the rise of acid house music were the two most significant events of the period and he brought them together in this one piece. It is the mixing of traditions that makes his work so compelling. Deller went on to win the Turner Prize in 2004 and has continued to make works which investigate the interface between art and popular culture, normally with a strong political and social aspect, although often the works are funny and witty.

Zhou Tao,"To realize « After Reality », Zhou Tao started to shoot in Guangzhou and arrived with a first editing of his film for his Parisian residency. From China, he brought back images of the luxuriant vegetation and of Dragon boat rowers in training. First, Tao decided to play their role, overseeing their movements that could inspire his performances.  Arriving in Paris, the confrontation was total. Chinese and Europeans share different notions of gardens and landscapes. And this was something very new for him to capture in this film. Tao worked to incorporate images shot in Paris to his previous editing, working on the idea of continuity in between spaces. He used the notion of “geometrical editing” to translate his aim to create an invisible space formed by images filmed in Guangzhou and in Paris.  He creates a third space, that of the film. As if he were classifying the different possible natural spaces inside urban zones, Tao portrays nature and man’s relation to it (being overwhelmed by it, taking care of it, staying alive thanks to its resources). Entitled “After Reality”, the film confronts us to a kind of unhistorical time, after urbanization and its planning, in which certain gestures of survival remain. Nature here seems to be the only rule to follow and weather conditions have the real power.","There is no single entry to the practice of Zhou Tao, who denies the existence of any singular or real narrative or space. Through often subtle and humorous interactions with people, things, actions, and situations, Zhou’s videos invites us to experience the multiple trajectories of reality—what he calls the “folding scenario” or the “zone with folds.” For him, the use of video is not a deliberate choice of artistic language or medium, instead the operation of the camera is a way of being that blends itself with everyday life.",After Reality,Asia,"['paris.n.01', 'shoot.v.01', 'space.n.01', 'movie.n.01', 'impression.n.01', 'nature.n.01', 'world.n.03', 'rule.n.01', 'garden.n.01', 'capture.v.01', 'entire.s.01', 'play.v.01', 'film.v.01', 'purpose.n.01', 'image.n.01', 'relation.n.01', 'natural.a.01', 'inspire.v.01', 'gesture.n.01', 'urban.a.01', 'power.n.01', 'real.a.01', 'motion.n.03', 'function.n.03', 'performance.n.01']","['garden.n.01', 'confrontation.n.05', 'cross-cultural.a.01', 'nature.n.01', 'guangzhou.n.01', 'paris.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/a7-1.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/a7-1-300x169.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/after-reality/,"['Society/5.250292397660819', 'Material_Physical/3.9790849673202615', 'Individual_Personal/1.6']","['Society', 'Material_Physical', 'Individual_Personal']",10.82937736498108,"['Urbanization/4.472514619883041', 'Land/2.3790849673202614', 'Identity/0.8']","['Urbanization', 'Land', 'Identity']",7.651599587203303,"['Cultural/24.282686920922217', 'Individual_Personal/23.553905408317178', 'Society/11.025672023195245']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Society']",58.862264352434636,"['Mind/9.966300366300366', 'Culture/9.230769230769232', 'Values/6.732142857142858']","['Mind', 'Culture', 'Values']",25.929212454212458,0.6666666666666666,0.0

They are both two examples of the artist’s many enigmatic photographs of models, actors, musicians, and other powerful figures rooted in the celebrity-driven culture of Los Angeles. Catching a glimpse of the model, the viewer enters into the world of the celebrity.

Burton employs soft light to emphasize the woman’s ideal beauty while problematizing the situation that affords the viewer this peek into her life.

Yael Bartana,"Yael Bartana’s video work A Declaration was shot in southern Tel Aviv, on the visible border between that city and Jaffa. It begins with the sound of waves and the image of the Israeli flag that fills the entire screen. This is followed by the whirring sounds of a helicopter. A young man in a white undershirt rows a boat carrying an olive tree in its place. With her camera work Bartana seems to flirt with 1930s Jewish National Fund (JNF) propaganda photography on the one hand, and with Leni Riefenstahl’s photographic technique, like the use of soft focus that distorts the perspective and vanishing point, on the other, A Declaration already attests to the action itself: on Andromeda’s Rock, Bartana replaces the Israeli flag with an olive tree. While this is indeed an act performed in a media context, it nevertheless takes place in the sphere of Israeli reality.  (exh.cat. Kunstverein in Hamburg, Hatje Cantz, 2007, p. 93)","The work of Yael Bartana investigates the imagination and imagery of identity and the politics of national memory and identity. Her interest in understanding and examining national statehood stems from being born in Israel, and being surrounded by the perpetual production of collective national identity. After completing her studies, Bartana undertook what she called ‘amateur anthropological’ research into ritual and myth making to take a critical perspective towards her own history and nationality. As a result of her politically charged practice that often deals with Jewish identity in Israel and abroad, she has garnered significant criticism, notably being labeled as anti-Zionist and a self-hating Jew. Despite this criticism, Bartana believes that, through her work as an artist, exploring both political statehood and religious and political diaspora, she is responsible for addressing these issues. Bartana believes that growing up in such a politically charged state requires artists to become either political artists, or escapists.",A Declaration,Middle East & Africa,"['flag.n.01', 'tree.n.01', 'sound.n.01', 'technique.n.01', 'wave.n.01', 'soft.a.01', 'perform.v.01', 'entire.s.01', 'boundary_line.n.01', 'shoot.v.01', 'rock.n.01', 'visible.a.01', 'screen.n.01', 'photography.n.01', 'hand.n.01', 'action.n.01', 'medium.n.01', 'white.a.01', 'photographic.a.01', 'context.n.01', 'world.n.03', 'position.n.03', 'camera.n.01', 'city.n.01', 'video.n.01']","['coexistence.n.01', 'olive_tree.n.01', 'zionism.n.01', 'armistice.n.01', 'heterogeneity.n.01', 'peace.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Yael-Bartana_A-Declaration_tree_site.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Yael-Bartana_A-Declaration_tree_site-300x225.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/a-declaration/,"['Individual_Personal/3.213675213675214', 'Material_Physical/2.435897435897436', 'Society/1.6387959866220736']","['Individual_Personal', 'Material_Physical', 'Society']",7.288368636194724,"['Materiality/2.435897435897436', 'Colonization/0.8695652173913043', 'Body/0.8333333333333334']","['Materiality', 'Colonization', 'Body']",4.138795986622074,"['Cultural/25.6448079096686', 'Material_Physical/17.840673705379594', 'Politics/16.352828054298648']","['Cultural', 'Material_Physical', 'Politics']",59.83830966934684,"['Space/7.969683257918551', 'Media/7.531108597285066', 'Arts/6.04553691922113']","['Space', 'Media', 'Arts']",21.546328774424747,0.3333333333333333,0.0
Mark Leckey,"In Made In Heaven, we are face to face with a sculptural apparition, a divine visitation in the artist’s studio. It isn’t just any object, but an iconic sculpture of the end of the 20th century: Jeff Koons’ Bunny.  One key question in this work is of course the construction of images, but there is also the question of sculpture, of the passage from two-dimensionality to three-dimensionality. The reason for using the moving image, above all theoretical, is also part of interrogation regarding the material construction of images. For this film, he remakes Koons’s sculpture in order to be able to experiment himself in his studio. One can discern the contours of his studio and sometimes his presence in a lot of his videos. With reference to Marcel Duchamp, he wants to create the ultimate Machine Célibataire (Bachelor Machine), by producing nothing other than itself in reference to the self- reflexivity of Pop.  The Bunny is a sculptural form in space which also produces images. It is obvious that we are in an image which is entirely constructed since it is impossible to film the object without having, at a certain point, the reflection of the camera on the steel surface. Mark Leckey is interested in the possibilities of new technologies and places at the heart of his practice the revelation of a sensitive and quasi-magical world. The film loop (which only lasts 2mn) places the spectator in a completely hypnotic state.","Mark Leckey became know in the 1990s with a cult film Fiorucci Made Me Hardcore about English clubs since the early 1970s. Rather like Jeremy Deller, his work at the time was a mixture of Pop culture and counter-culture. In fact a constant in his work is an interest in the icons of our visual culture. In Felix Gets Broadcasted, he became interested in Felix The Cat who was first of all present at the beginning of the 20th century in over 250 newspapers and was the first character to benefit from TV transmission in 1928 in New York. This is the story of a cartoon hero and his successful conversion from cinema to the written press and then to TV, before being integrated into the art system.

Tobias Rehberger,"9’oclock (my time is not your time) pertains to a series consisting of three numbers: 5, 10 and 11 works were made for the exhibition “Signs and messages from modern life” at the Kate McGarry Gallery in 2007. The notion of time is a recurring theme in Tobias Rehberger’s work. We can recall the exhibition ‘Night Shift’ at the Palais de Tokyo ( Paris) in 2002 where the works could be seen only from the angle of the sun, exploring the relationship between day, night, and other natural cycles like the sun and moon, life and death. But in 9’oclock (my time is not your time), time becomes a pattern. The artist manipulates the number nine by printing it on three stacked glass plates. Depending on the position and the viewer’s eye, the shape evolves to deconstruct the meaning completely. This work is characteristic of artist’s practice in the way in which he borrows 70s design (in the refinement of its production, its appearance, and color), and the issue of perception, of deconstruction, and transformation.","A student of Martin Kippenberger, Tobias Rehberger emerged in the 1990s as one of the major artists of the younger generation in Germany and one of the most active on the international stage. For example, he worked with the artist Olafur Eliasson and presented his work in solo exhibitions in institutions: the Museum Ludwig in Cologne, the Palacio de Cristal in Madrid, the Whitechapel in London, the Serralves Foundation in Porto or the Palais de Tokyo in Paris. Tobias Rehberger can be considered as a sculptor, in the “classic” sense, while questioning the medium and its meaning today. Close to the aesthetics of design, he realizes functional forms not like his sculptures entitled “Handicapped” or “Infections”.  Tobias Rhberger was born in 1966 in Essligen am Neckar, Germany.

Nathalie Djurberg,"Like many of Djurberg’s films this work engages with the nightmarish grotesque, a theme of common currency in contemporary art. In this particular film, Djurberg deals with a theme that is becoming all too common in our lives, caring for an elderly, infirm parent. The film suggests not only the degradation of the demented mother, covered with bed sores, but her daughter’s effort to care for her that ultimately leads to her death at the hands of the mother: the burden of looking after her literally crushes her to death.  Like all of Djurberg’s work, the film is very painterly, bridging the gap between film, sculpture and painting. She has stated that the writings of Georges Bataille, that she encountered as a student, made an impact on her, as the scatological and anxious nature of her work attests. Ironic, humorous, terrifying, cruel and tender, Once Removed…, is typical of Djurberg’s animalistic vision.","In the late 1990s, Nathalie Djurberg started to work with Super 8 film, then video, staging plasticine models or puppets. Her animations are short narratives, fairy tales or nightmares for adults in cynical representations of relations between humans and animals. Reminiscent of the Czech Surrealist Jan Svankmajer’s clay animation films, as well as more recent work by Claes Oldenburg or Paul McCarthy, they push the boundaries of what is sacrilegious in art, eroticism and cinema. Glass or ceramic sculptures and installations add actual object-hood to her cartoon-like creations. The accompanying music is generally by Hans Berg.“Immersion in the dark vortex where things are carnal and sexual, humiliating and shameful, coagulated as exemplars of familial and erotic relationships of subjection, animalism and irreverence, is the procedure Nathalie Djurberg adopts to show the despoliation process experienced by the individual”.

Nathalie Djurberg,"Apparently Djurberg’s mother made a puppet theater and traveled around Göteborg performing during her childhood. This short story of a young man initially listening to birdsong in a city, suddenly confronted to warfare and wounded, could visually resemble child’s doll game or mise en scène, with a high dose of cynicism and violence. The figure, Hans, is attended to by two nurses whose raw discussion appears in speech bubbles: “we’ll have to amputate”. Djurberg employs the full formal potential of the clay material and basic building blocks to emphasize the morphing messiness and randomness of destruction. The scenario ends with the ironic comment about him now being “happy and useless”.  “One of the first films I made, Hans förlorar sina båda armar och ben (2004), was pretty much about me and my relationship to harm at that time. The idea came from a dream I had. I dreamed that someone was trying to save the world, and then he lost both his arms and legs, but he was still trying to help by cleaning the street that really smelled. My mother and my grandmother were standing there looking at him and saying to each other things like “oh, look, he’s so useless”, “yeah, but he’s happy, useless and happy.” I was initially devastated by this dream, but then I began to think it was funny. I thought I wasn’t allowed to think it was funny because I really didn’t want him to lose his arms and legs. When you are not allowed to do something, you become attracted to it.” Quoted in “Germano Celant – Nathalie Djurberg”, in Nathalie Djurberg.

Dennis Adams,"The video Make down is a 34 minute sequence shot that shows the artist removing make-up in front of a mirror. The peculiarity of the scene consists in two symbolic details: first, the make-up itself, covering his face, hair and torso – a thick kaki layer, reminding of military camouflage – and second, the paper used to remove the make-up – black and white prints of stills taken from Gillo Pontecorvo’s 1965 film, “La bataille d’Alger”  ( The Battle of Algiers). These still images put together recreate a sequence in which a young Algerian woman takes off her veil and puts on Western make-up. This disguise will help her pass the border and place a bomb in the French area of Algiers. Censured in France when it came out, the movie combines history and feminist activism; it may also be reinterpreted today in relation to the recent history of terrorism. The video goes with an installation: a vitrine enclosing the 96 prints soiled by the make-up, the remains of the artist’s performance, as if it were a reliquary. Compared to the terrorist’s gesture, the action is performed backwards by the artist, which could suggest the impossibility of having a unique reading of history.","Since 1998, through site specific works, often in public spaces, or video works, Dennis Adams focuses on ambiguous characters, condemned by our recent history,  revealing traumas or collective amnesia phenomena. The specific episodes from 20th or 21st century history he refers to find a relevance in today’s sensitive actuality. Dennis Adams plays with the ideological power of images, by referring to cinema and media images, yet leaving their meaning open to interpretation: he does not state clearly his political stance, but underlines the complexity of history and lets the spectator form his own opinion.Dennis Adams was born in Des Moines, Iowa, in 1948.

Dennis Adams,"Observing the sky after 11 September 2001, Dennis Adams photographed elements which had been lifted by drafts and were floating above the city of New York. The artist was only able to identify the objects after developing and enlarging the prints: you can read “He’s no terrorist”. The front page of the newspaper thrusts back to ‘the event’ of the 21st century and is revealed only through the detailed observation of the image; the painful twist of the newspaper could be a rustling wing. The simplicity of the process gives the work a poetic and prophetic dimension: a slight debris of a society, suspended between the sky and the earth in a blue infinite, sad news taken elsewhere, pieces of paper disintegrating. Violence, fracas and horror are audible in the silence of the image. These debris are transfigured into the silence of the victims flying towards a blue eternity. The artist pays a modest and painful homage. There is no taking sides, no judgment, just a flight in the sky. Dennis Adams sounds out collective memory, the public sphere, the urban context in their relations to art.","Since 1998, through site specific works, often in public spaces, or video works, Dennis Adams focuses on ambiguous characters, condemned by our recent history,  revealing traumas or collective amnesia phenomena.

Using black and white film as a reference to the documentary genre and a gesture of resistance to the color-rich saturation of consumer culture, Mofokeng’s work presents new meanings on the trodden landscapes Soweto, favoring memory and identity over ownership and power. In highlighting the impoverishment of South African landscape in the face of capital expansion, Mofokeng’s photographs implore emancipation from the global oppression of greed.","Altar at Kliprivier, Soweto",Middle East & Africa,"['water.n.01', 'photographer.n.01', 'probe.n.01', 'africa.n.01', 'ritual.n.01', 'south.n.01', 'corporate.s.03', 'street.n.01', 'landscape.n.01', 'series.n.01']","['everyday.s.01', 'contamination.n.03', 'ritual.n.02', 'ecology.n.01', 'river.n.01', 'consequence.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/140.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/140-300x200.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/altar-at-kliprivier-soweto/,"['Society/9.00142390289449', 'Material_Physical/6.2945250827603765', 'Cultural/3.423529411764706']","['Society', 'Material_Physical', 'Cultural']",18.71947839741957,"['Colonization/3.1765873015873014', 'Environmental/2.761904761904762', 'Time/2.732620320855615']","['Colonization', 'Environmental', 'Time']",8.671112384347678,"['Material_Physical/8.9997557997558', 'Society/5.082956259426847', 'Cultural/1.8235294117647058']","['Material_Physical', 'Society', 'Cultural']",15.906241470947354,"['Land/7.421978021978021', 'Culture/1.8235294117647058', 'History/1.8235294117647058']","['Land', 'Culture', 'History']",11.069036845507433,1.0,0.0
Elisheva Biernoff,"In her recent work, Biernoff is interested in investigating fictions and fantasies embedded in the remnants of consumer culture (for example magazines) or through ephemera such as postcards and old photographs. Although the imagery present in her work might seem nostalgic upon first encounter, Biernoff’s complex tableaux often reveal the artist’s skeptical look towards her subjects matters. They Were Here (2010), constitutes a clear example. The 16 ft long tableau confronts the viewer with a seemingly paradisiacal scene: a tropical deserted island with white sands and blooming trees appears to be a coveted destination. However the scene quickly turns into a dystopian image, once one pays attention to the small details camouflaged inside it: an erupting volcano or a dead bird. Biernoff places a pair of binoculars in front of the painting to reinforce this idea. Looking through their fake mdf lenses, the painted landscape is rendered blurry. The whole scene acts up as the backdrop of a theater act and the prop quality of its elements suggests a certain lightness associated with utopian dreams.","Elisheva Biernoff’s work engages and reconsiders the tradition of painting in an interesting way, often taking source material from media or recreating photographs through a careful trompe d’oeil technique. Thus, her work engages in the discussion of re-representation through painting, not aiming to portray any given reality faithfully but rather as the ideal way to engage with a subject matter that explores the intersection between myths, fictions and fantasies. In some cases, her works also address particular ecological concerns.",They Were Here,Americas,"['scene.n.01', 'bird.n.01', 'tropical.s.01', 'render.v.01', 'pair.n.01', 'theater.n.01', 'fantasy.n.01', 'brush.n.06', 'tree.n.01', 'matter.n.01', 'dream.n.01', 'island.n.01', 'magazine.n.01', 'complex.a.01', 'fiction.n.01', 'details.n.01', 'quality.n.01', 'attention.n.01', 'white.a.01', 'elements.n.01', 'idea.n.01', 'culture.n.01', 'landscape.n.01', 'spectator.n.01', 'photograph.n.01']","['eden.n.01', 'look.n.02', 'dystopia.n.02', 'popular.s.04', 'fiction.n.01', 'utopia.n.02']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/elisheva_biernoff_they_were_here_web.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/elisheva_biernoff_they_were_here_web-300x225.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/they-were-here/,"['Cultural/14.878280542986428', 'Individual_Personal/4.198529411764706', 'Material_Physical/2.533333333333333']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Material_Physical']",21.610143288084465,"['Fantasy/12.57058823529412', 'Spirituality/1.6985294117647058', 'Arts/1.5384615384615385']","['Fantasy', 'Spirituality', 'Arts']",15.807579185520364,"['Cultural/34.08173218885631', 'Individual_Personal/23.599042950513546', 'Material_Physical/12.472857861093159']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Material_Physical']",70.15363300046302,"['Mind/8.714835164835165', 'Media/8.562350824270329', 'Fantasy/8.248529411764707']","['Mind', 'Media', 'Fantasy']",25.5257154008702,1.0,0.3333333333333333

Felipe Arturo,"Defined as entropy, the second law of thermodynamics proposes that energy is more easily dispersed than it is concentrated. One basic illustration of entropy is to imagine white and black sand: once mixed together, it is highly unlikely that the contrasting grains of sand can be separated and restored to their original distinct color groups. Arturo’s Trópico Entrópico (Entropic Tropics, 2012) considers the colonization of the American continent as a similarly irreversible process of cultural entropy. His inspiration derives from a place near Manaus in the Brazilian Amazon, where the Black River meets with the sandy-colored Solimões River, producing a river of two colors that extends over ten kilometers. In the late nineteenth century, the Brazilian rubber barons decided to commemorate this impressive natural phenomenon by covering the main square of Manaus with a design of black-and-white waveforms made from stones. The square is known as the Encontro das aguas (Meeting of the Waters). Decades later, Roberto Burle Marx used this same pattern in his famous Copacabana walkway in Rio de Janeiro. Since then, the design has spread across the continent to Lima, Bogotá, Cali, and beyond. Trópico entrópico uses this pattern to produce entropy in the exhibition space. Sugar, the material used, signifies one of many economic motivators for colonialism. Visitors are invited to collectively dissolve this modern design by walking on the brown and white sugar, and participating in its entropic mixing.","Felipe Arturo considers elements from urbanism, architecture, and art in relation to politics, history, geography, and economy. His works and projects often manifest as sculptures, installations, or videos, departing from concepts such as structure, sequence, and matter. They are deeply influenced by vernacular architecture and construction techniques, and reflect processes of assimilation and resistance to colonial and postcolonial processes. He frequently combines the language and materials of Modernism (e.g., concrete) with the informal methods of autoconstrucción (self-construction).",Trópico entrópico,Americas,"['design.n.01', 'square.n.01', 'form.n.03', 'white.a.01', 'invite.v.01', 'black.n.01', 'visitor.n.01', 'phenomenon.n.01', 'produce.v.01', 'imagine.v.01', 'century.n.01', 'economic.a.01', 'rock.n.01', 'colors.n.01', 'celebrated.s.01', 'natural.a.01', 'american.a.01', 'modern.a.01', 'color.n.01', 'original.s.01', 'black.a.01', 'cultural.a.01', 'procedure.n.01', 'material.n.01', 'space.n.01']","['disorder.n.01', 'sugar.n.01', 'colonialism.n.01', 'form.n.03', 'floor.n.01', 'history.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/felipe_arturo_tropico_entropico_web.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/felipe_arturo_tropico_entropico_web-300x200.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/tropico-entropico/,"['Society/7.5523257616136865', 'Politics/4.016965490649701', 'Cultural/2.6527777777777777']","['Society', 'Politics', 'Cultural']",14.222069030041165,"['Violence/2.4656346749226006', 'Power/2.307692307692308', 'History/1.7777777777777777']","['Violence', 'Power', 'History']",6.551104760392686,"['Cultural/15.068060044530636', 'Material_Physical/14.653724053724059', 'Individual_Personal/11.372161172161174']","['Cultural', 'Material_Physical', 'Individual_Personal']",41.09394527041587,"['Space/7.235042735042734', 'Arts/5.534640522875817', 'Time/4.123809523809524']","['Space', 'Arts', 'Time']",16.893492781728074,0.3333333333333333,0.0
Pia Camil,"Camil has made numerous paintings and photographs of halted projects along Mexico’s highways (she calls them “highway follies”), and of abandoned billboards that look like theater curtains dramatizing failed capitalist strategies. (Espectacular, the colloquial Spanish term for “billboard,” also translates more literally as “spectacle,” and of course recalls Guy Debord’s famous 1967 book The Society of the Spectacle.) In Mexico, the urban landscape has been taken over by billboards; they are totally integrated into the landscape. With overuse and reuse, they get scrapped, reshuffled, and recycled. In Espectacular (cortina) (Spectacular [Curtain], 2012), Camil abstracts such billboards into a multicolored fabric curtain to probe the multiple meanings of espectacular. The curtain is intended to work not only as a three-dimensional painting, but also as a screen that obstructs or conceals another space, causing the viewer to wonder: if nothing is on the other side of the curtain, who is the audience and who are the actors?","Through her installations and performance-based work, Pia Camil demonstrates a keen interest in failure. She often explores urban ruins—decay associated with the Mexican urban landscape, and specifically traces of modernist culture and art history that have been left behind. By incorporating appropriation and performance methods, Camil enacts a critical questioning of previously identified discourses, deconstructing preestablished references in order to generate a sense of estrangement in which she can explore the political connotations of the use of space.",Espectacular cortina,Americas,"['billboard.n.01', 'mexico.n.01', 'landscape.n.01', 'urban.a.01 landscape.n.01', 'fabric.n.01', 'theater.n.01', 'scheme.n.01', 'multiple.a.01', 'audience.n.01', 'actor.n.01', 'celebrated.s.01', 'screen.n.01', 'urban.a.01', 'society.n.01', 'book.n.01', 'meaning.n.01', 'undertaking.n.01', 'spectator.n.01', 'space.n.01', 'photograph.n.01']","['abstraction.n.04', 'handicraft.n.01', 'commercialization.n.01', 'space.n.03', 'craft.n.04', 'digit.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/pia_camil_espectacular_cortina_web.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/pia_camil_espectacular_cortina_web-300x223.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/espectacular-cortina/,"['Cultural/7.586515307877536', 'Material_Physical/6.007692307692308', 'Society/2.426373626373626']","['Cultural', 'Material_Physical', 'Society']",16.020581241943468,"['Arts/4.319573443412453', 'Land/3.207692307692308', 'Media/2.4891640866873064']","['Arts', 'Land', 'Media']",10.016429837792067,"['Cultural/22.421407961177792', 'Society/17.392948717948723', 'Material_Physical/7.065182186234818']","['Cultural', 'Society', 'Material_Physical']",46.87953886536134,"['Arts/8.576646556058321', 'Urbanization/7.574358974358975', 'Media/5.727350427350427']","['Arts', 'Urbanization', 'Media']",21.878355957767724,1.0,0.6666666666666666

Edgardo Aragón,"Efectos de familia (Family Effects, 2007–9) is a series of 13 videos that dramatize an array of abusive events derived from Edgardo Aragón’s family’s history—specifically its involvement with organized crime. Each episode is an action performed by some combination of his two young cousins, nephew, and younger brother. In one, a boy is shot to death inside a pickup truck. In another, two of them endure a brick-carrying competition. In another, a boy digs his grave. The work is about a collective social condition of survival and endurance, and it is inextricable from the broader context of contemporary Mexico, especially its skyrocketing crime rates and the disaster of its national economy. By using reenactment as an artistic medium, Aragón attempts to educate his young family members to avoid criminal entanglements.","Edgardo Aragón’s works employ reenactment to reflect the everyday reality of rural Mexico. Using narratives inspired by the particularities of their respective local contexts, Aragón evokes events—some with very violent undertones—and shapes them into scenes molded by landscapes. His work also addresses points of familial and social inheritance that are conditioned by the local environment, creating a personal body of work recounted through poetic narratives. Each piece is a story slowly told—a description of a memory or a reconstruction of a personal experience—that shows some of the darker sides of Mexico’s social and economic realities.",Efectos de familia,Unspecified,"['family.n.01', 'male_child.n.01', 'combination.n.01', 'perform.v.01', 'mexico.n.01', 'death.n.01', 'shoot.v.01', 'corporate.s.03', 'event.n.01', 'contemporary.s.01', 'action.n.01', 'medium.n.01', 'context.n.01', 'social.a.01', 'video.n.01', 'series.n.01']","['endurance.n.01', 'organized_crime.n.01', 'family.n.04', 'survival.n.01', 'reenactment.n.01', 'mexico.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/edgardo_aragon_efectos_de_familia_copy.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/edgardo_aragon_efectos_de_familia_copy-300x169.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/efectos-de-familia/,"['Cultural/7.151629072681704', 'Society/5.795959595959596', 'Material_Physical/5.158344579397211']","['Cultural', 'Society', 'Material_Physical']",18.10593324803851,"['Arts/4.7897243107769425', 'Land/2.6198830409356724', 'Community/2.6']","['Arts', 'Land', 'Community']",10.009607351712615,"['Cultural/19.829277095453573', 'Politics/14.430769230769235', 'Society/13.050305250305252']","['Cultural', 'Politics', 'Society']",47.310351576528056,"['Media/6.761877828054298', 'Technology/4.966666666666667', 'Activism/4.861538461538462']","['Media', 'Technology', 'Activism']",16.590082956259426,0.6666666666666666,0.0

Pedro Reyes,"Pedro Reyes’s Los Mutantes (Mutants, 2012) is composed of 170 plates that combine characters from ancient and modern mythologies. As in a periodic table, animals and objects are combined with humans (male or female), providing a rational framework for the irrational products of human imagination. A Cartesian matrix such as this must follow certain rules. All figures are half-human, half-something. Animal/cartoon characters that speak, such as Fritz the Cat or Donald Duck, are excluded, as well as oddities and chimeras without recognizable human features. Their arrangement results in combinations such as fish plus woman equals mermaid; bull plus man equals minotaur, and so on. The juxtapositions cross figures from pop culture with those from ancient myths, encouraging us to notice similarities between religious icons and comic-book characters. All of these “mutants” reveal something about our desire to extract qualities of animals or objects and empower ourselves with them. Mythologies are a reflection of the paradigms of their time, and this kind of periodic table presents a rational framework to categorize irrational products of the imagination.","Pedro Reyes’s works traverse the worlds of art, film, architecture, design, social criticism, and pedagogy. Educated as an architect, Reyes draws on this training to engage with utopian aspirations and the ongoing legacy of Modernism, often focusing on issues of scale and space while questioning pressing social issues through the incitement of individual or collective interaction. Although only a few of his works are directly located within the practice of building, almost all involve some kind of construction, whether they are objects, models, interiors, or social spaces. Reyes also makes use of strategies developed for communication or education, as well as everyday humor, to engage his audiences. Many of his works either allow large-scale public engagement or suggest a possible use: weapons turned to shovels, multilevel parks in old modernist buildings, and small spherical rooms. Like many avant-garde thinkers of the past, Reyes constructs new forms of architecture necessary for new ways of life.",Los Mutantes,Unspecified,"['imagination.n.01', 'animal.n.01', 'fictional_character.n.01', 'model.n.01', 'human.a.01', 'figure.n.01', 'world.n.08', 'object.n.01', 'table.n.01', 'rule.n.01', 'combination.n.01', 'religious.s.01', 'agreement.n.04', 'icon.n.01', 'contemplation.n.02', 'quality.n.01', 'modern.a.01', 'desire.n.01', 'compose.v.01', 'woman.n.01', 'culture.n.01', 'time.n.01']","['mutant.a.01', 'mutate.v.01', 'periodic_table.n.01', 'mythology.n.01', 'juxtaposition.n.01', 'male.n.01', 'female.n.01', 'animal.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/pedro_reyes_los_mutantes_copy_0.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/pedro_reyes_los_mutantes_copy_0-300x137.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/los-mutantes/,"['Politics/2.4000000000000004', 'Individual_Personal/2.4000000000000004', 'Cultural/2.4000000000000004']","['Politics', 'Individual_Personal', 'Cultural']",7.200000000000001,"['Politics/1.6', 'Environmental/0.9333333333333333', 'Community/0.8']","['Politics', 'Environmental', 'Community']",3.333333333333333,"['Individual_Personal/33.45809152148162', 'Material_Physical/11.137429546717474', 'Cultural/8.579017490936996']","['Individual_Personal', 'Material_Physical', 'Cultural']",53.17453855913609,"['Emotion/12.381618381618384', 'Mind/9.525379625534423', 'Fantasy/6.232008943928449']","['Emotion', 'Mind', 'Fantasy']",28.139006951081257,0.6666666666666666,0.0

Voluspa Jarpa,"To make Minimal Secret (2012), Jarpa created sculptures based on pages of declassified CIA information about the United States’ involvement in Chile. The cutouts in the acrylic represent the content that was blacked out when the pages were released to the public. For Jarpa, that so much content from these documents was deleted before declassification is symptomatic of hysterical behavior, which, in Freudian psychoanalysis, results from the inability to deal with trauma. Jarpa reclaims the blots of the original documents as the structure of the artwork, mimicking the same denial of access that entered them into classification in the first place. By working at the juncture of the public and the secret, the artist aims to question how images and materials construct notions of public and private, transparency and opacity. The documents’ promise of disclosure ultimately materializes as repression, given that barely anything remains legible.","Voluspa Jarpa’s work is based upon a meticulous analysis of political, historical, and social documents from Chile and other Latin American countries, which she uses to develop a reflection on the concept of memory.

Diana Thater,"In Perpetual Motion (2005) the seemingly erratic flight of the bright orange Monarch butterfly—filmed in its winter habitat of Michoacán, Mexico—is intensified by the artist’s editing in which frames are randomly dropped and the film is sped up. As a result, the butterflies become hyper-real and animated in appearance. The manipulated footage is presented in a video wall of nine monitors, where the butterflies flit from screen to screen, in a room bathed in vivid orange light.","A pioneer of video and film installations for over a decade, Diana Thater’s works explore the nature and possibilities of moving-image media. Thater describes her work as “Neo-Structualist Installations” that aim to make viewers look anew at architectural environments and the way they perceive video and film. The natural world has been a recurring motif in Thater’s work since the early 1990s, and she brings the outdoors into the gallery to address the relationship between modern technology and notions of beauty and the sublime.

Ron Terada,"The three Maikos were included in Ron Terada’s 2008 exhibition, Voight–Kampf, at Catriona Jeffries gallery. More ambitious in size and subject matter, this show with its complex video installation marked a new path for Terada’s work. Voight-Kampf is based on a scene from Ridley Scott’s 1982 movie Blade Runner in which a giant advertising billboard in the midst of a dystopian city of Los Angeles in the future displays a geisha eating candy. Terada used this image as a point of departure to explore issues of racial identity, the nature of photographic representation, and the liminal space between fiction and reality. In each of the three Maiko photographs that accompanied the exhibition, a Caucasian woman poses a Geisha and look directly at the camera. The images reinforce the staged and artificial nature of racial categories and stereotypes, but also speak to the excesses brought about by an accelerated consumer culture.","Ron Terada belongs to a generation of Vancouver-based artists that follows the well-known Vancouver School of photoconceptualists which includes Jeff Wall, Stan Douglas, and Ian Wallace. However, Terada’s work is also closely aligned with other conceptual practices like Bruce Nauman’s use of signs, neon lights, and text paintings.","Maiko #1, #2, #3",Americas,"['nature.n.01', 'billboard.n.01', 'size.n.01', 'ad.n.01', 'los_angeles.n.01', 'future.n.01', 'bring.v.01', 'capable.s.02', 'matter.n.01', 'research.v.02', 'include.v.01', 'complex.a.01', 'issue.n.01', 'fiction.n.01', 'identity.n.01', 'representation.n.01', 'woman.n.01', 'establish.v.08', 'photographic.a.01', 'image.n.01', 'world.n.03', 'culture.n.01', 'camera.n.01', 'city.n.01', 'scene.n.01']","['color.n.04', 'consumerism.n.01', 'representation.n.03', 'gender.n.01', 'geisha.n.01', 'artificial.a.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/ron_terada_maiko_1_of_3_2008.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/ron_terada_maiko_1_of_3_2008-199x300.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/maiko-1-2-3/,"['Society/1.9090909090909092', 'Individual_Personal/1.6666666666666665', 'Material_Physical/1.6181818181818182']","['Society', 'Individual_Personal', 'Material_Physical']",5.193939393939393,"['Economy/1.9090909090909092', 'Identity/0.8888888888888888', 'Physics/0.8181818181818182']","['Economy', 'Identity', 'Physics']",3.6161616161616164,"['Individual_Personal/33.54697247197249', 'Cultural/25.674450549450555', 'Material_Physical/20.68988005458594']","['Individual_Personal', 'Cultural', 'Material_Physical']",79.91130307600898,"['Mind/13.636630036630038', 'Culture/11.923076923076925', 'Urbanization/8.665274800878516']","['Mind', 'Culture', 'Urbanization']",34.22498176058548,0.6666666666666666,0.0

California Stories: Attempt to correlate social class with elevation above main harbor channel (San Pedro, July 1975) (1973–2011) is a series of coupled gelatin silver prints that show the artist using his hand to measure the elevation of various pieces of real estate, ranging from a manicured mansion to a ramshackle beach house. A direct equation becomes evident between the social strata these homes represent and the height at which the artist holds his hand.

Houck layers the photograph with multiple exposures, lending an uneasy tripling effect to the static object. Borrowing his title from Ernest Hemingway’s enigmatic, apocryphal six-word novel (“For Sale: Baby Shoes, Never Worn”), Houck’s photograph engages the ideal and image of childhood from the distanced point of view of the camera’s lens.","An MFA graduate from UCLA, John Houck works primarily in the medium of photography and specializes in still-life vignettes. To make his works, Houck arranges an object on a sheet of paper, photographs, and prints it, then places that print back into a new composition, repeating the process again and again until arriving at an aggregate image. The layers appear to be digitally altered, but he does not utilize any postproduction interventions. But Houck is not a purist by any means; he is significantly influenced by his professional experience as a computer programmer, and his artistic methodology mirrors a kind of algorithmic code. By referencing a conventional artistic genre through an iterative and contingent process, Houck offers up photography as a mode of thought.","Baby Shoes, Never Worn",Americas,"['place.n.06', 'childhood.n.01', 'photograph.n.01', 'object.n.01', 'mother.n.01', 'multiple.a.01', 'box.n.01', 'photographer.n.01', 'image.n.01', 'position.n.03', 'camera.n.01', 'title.n.01', 'series.n.01']","['childhood.n.01', 'shoebox.n.02', 'multiply.v.02', 'layered.s.01', 'unreal.a.02', 'hemingway.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/john_houck_baby_shoes_never_worn_web.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/john_houck_baby_shoes_never_worn_web-222x300.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/baby-shoes-never-worn/,"['Individual_Personal/3.4835164835164836', 'Society/1.7692307692307692', 'Material_Physical/1.5384615384615385']","['Individual_Personal', 'Society', 'Material_Physical']",6.791208791208791,"['Familial/1.8571428571428572', 'Body/1.6263736263736264', 'Time/1.5384615384615385']","['Familial', 'Body', 'Time']",5.021978021978022,"['Cultural/12.302450980392159', 'Individual_Personal/10.206349206349207', 'Politics/5.507692307692308']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Politics']",28.016492494433678,"['Familial/3.78021978021978', 'Politics/3.2', 'Culture/3.076923076923077']","['Familial', 'Politics', 'Culture']",10.057142857142857,0.3333333333333333,0.3333333333333333
Ari Marcopoulos,"In Jackass (2008) by Ari Marcopoulos, his two sons, Cairo and Ethan, are pictured relaxing in a disheveled bedroom in their Sonoma home. One plays with some sort of board game while the other holds either a book or DVD of the movie Jackass Number Two, presumably the source of the photograph’s title. As Marcopoulos has continued to document his sons, and as they have become teenagers, the images of them begin to closely resemble the teenagers in much of his earlier work. The boys in Markopoulos’ images have become less his sons and more anthropological subjects of study, the youths that started his photographic career over thirty years ago. Jackass is a perfect example of the full circle that Marcopoulos’ career has made.","Dutch artist Ari Marcopoulos moved to the United States in 1980 and has become an important documentarian of American fringe culture over the last three decades. The subject matter of Marcopoulos’ photographs and videos have ranged from skateboarding and snowboarding to the New York art scene, including Warhol’s Factory, in the 1980’s. Now residing in Northern California, Marcopoulos has focused his lens on his family. Often documenting his sons against the California landscape, he has stressed that these photos are not meant to be autobiographical but archetypes of the idea of family.

Ari Marcopoulos,"A photograph of a tin box full of marijuana simply titled Green Box, speaks to the constantly changing status of the substance–once taboo or illicit, now a symbol of a growing industry in Northern California. In the past a photograph of marijuana would more likely be found in an evidence file than an art museum or gallery, but today continued debates about the legality of marijuana and the industry surrounding it has brought the substance into common public view. Green Box is a strong example of the current sociopolitical state of California and the grey areas that exist in legislature and at the same time illustrates the unavoidable commercialization of once underground cultures.","Dutch artist Ari Marcopoulos moved to the United States in 1980 and has become an important documentarian of American fringe culture over the last three decades.

The simplicity of Ojih Odutola’s compositions enables a consideration of skin, blackness, surface, and detail, all hovering out of time and space.","Though born in Nigeria, artist Toyin Ojih Odutola was raised largely in the United States, living in Alabama, California, and now New York. Known for her intricate drawings of human heads and figures, Ojih Odutola’s artistic practice is concerned with the representation of race, and the concept of blackness as visual marker and social construct. Her drawings are made through intricately and fastidiously layering black lines—building up a density that Ojih Odutola describes as “black on black on black.” Using pens and markers as her primary media, Ojih Odutola builds textures through sinewy black lines, shot through at times with metallic color.

George Pfau,"This work exemplifies George Pfau’s interest in zombies and liminal embodiment. In different ways, zombies are present here as an icon of coming apart, yet they retain a persistent thereness. In Zombie Swallows The World, the image of the figure is almost overcome by strong light that visually blows away the edges of the body. In Zombie Examined, the frayed edges of the body are undone by a clinical look, rather than a visual effect. The piece presents what is actually one of the clearer of Pfau’s zombie renderings, and certainly the most precisely illustrative in this set.","George Pfau’s work explores marginal and transitional states of being. Decaying bodies and exposed buildings populate his work. His interest in the in-between also extends to material techniques, as Pfau’s pieces are often built in layers and remain semi-transparent.

Pauline Boudry and Renate Lorenz,"Salomania sees choreographer and filmmaker Yvonne Rainer and artist Wu Tsang rehearse scenes from Valda’s Solo, a chapter of a film Rainer made in 1972 after having seen women perform the dance of the seven veils in Alla Nazimova’s 1923 silent film Salomé.The script is based on the Biblical New Testament story of the Jewish princess Salomé, who in the Christian tradition has been depicted as an emblem of feminine seduction and danger. In the twentieth century, her character was made popular through English playwright Oscar Wilde’s famous theater piece, Salomé. Boudry and Lorenz’s video explores Salomé’s queer potential and the practice of drag performance, thus also reminding us that Nazimova herself was bisexual. Salomaniais therefore a historical reconstruction that not only recounts the history of the ballet, but also the history of how images and bodies have been imagined.","For several years now, artists Pauline Boudry and Renate Lorenz have been conducting research on the heritage of cultural and gender studies, concentrating primarily on gender discourses and the notion of queer. They are interested in historical figures who were marginalized because they incarnated a sexual “perversion” and who went on stage to seek some recognition in their time. These stigmatized characters are made visible once again by Boudry and Lorenz who revisit archives as a base for their films, installations and texts. These works demonstrate how visibility (since the beginning of the modern period) of these bodies allows for a claim to power, a certain glamour, and a form of recognition. Nevertheless it also contributes to making these bodies pathological or criminal, to devalue them. Their work ponders on the quasi-simultaneity of the invention of sexual perversions and photography as well as they link to colonial economy at the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th. Thus Boudry and Lorenz weave links between different epochs as if to readdress the notion of “normality”. Playing with the conventions of cross-dressing and fetishization, the exhibition of these characters is doubled up with a baroque mise en scène.",Salomania,Europe,"['history.n.01', 'theater.n.01', 'reconstruction.n.01', 'perform.v.01', 'solo.n.01', 'imagine.v.01', 'picture.v.02', 'dance.n.01', 'century.n.01', 'potential.n.01', 'movie.n.01', 'popular.a.01', 'celebrated.s.01', 'tradition.n.01', 'historical.a.01', 'woman.n.01', 'practice.n.01', 'establish.v.08', 'body.n.01', 'performance.n.01', 'fictional_character.n.01', 'narrative.n.01', 'scene.n.01', 'piece.n.01', 'video.n.01']","['normality.n.04', 'transgender.s.01', 'perversion.n.02', 'stigmatize.v.01', 'archive.n.01', 'human_body.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/photo3.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/photo3-300x199.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/salomania/,"['Individual_Personal/3.5123626373626373', 'Material_Physical/2.307692307692308', 'Society/1.8']","['Individual_Personal', 'Material_Physical', 'Society']",7.620054945054945,"['Space/2.307692307692308', 'Body/1.7980769230769231', 'Identity/1.7142857142857142']","['Space', 'Body', 'Identity']",5.820054945054945,"['Cultural/40.713854609442855', 'Individual_Personal/30.553163829634435', 'Society/25.849012425483018']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Society']",97.11603086456032,"['Arts/14.934383753501402', 'Spirituality/11.146764346764348', 'Media/9.044627594627595']","['Arts', 'Spirituality', 'Media']",35.12577569489335,0.6666666666666666,0.0
Charles Avery,"Charles Avery has been constructing a narrative in his work since 2004. Between fantasy and reality, The Islanders is a very particular universe he has created in which to gather his disparate ideas. His practice primarily involves drawing, sculptures, texts and installations which participate in the epic and dreamlike narrative whole in the course of making. “I discovered a way to create a place where I could lay out and rationalize according to the space rather than to logic. This place enables me to affirm relations between the different elements. Thus whatever I make or write, whatever the context in which the work operates, its ultimate and absolute meaning remains linked to The Island”.  Charles Avery has no interest in placing his work within the history of art, instead he is intent on constructing a autonomous environment, purposely distancing the public. “The spectator is a tourist, a traveler, a writer, a missionary, an itinerant, a bounty hunter, a pioneer, in this country.” Amongst Avery’s most renowned drawings with extremely composed figurative scenes, there are geographical maps that situate The Island in relation to a fictional archipelago Triangland. Untitled (Map) is one of the pieces that enables the viewer to comprehend the context of this archipelago as well as discover the topography of his account.","Charles Avery was born in 1973 in Oban, Isle of Mull, Scotland.

Eamon Ore-Giron,"Eamon Ore-Giron’s new commissioned video project Bite Work, is an experimental genre breaking video that is part-performance, part-conceptual and part-comical addressing issues of mediation, surveillance and trust. The main characters in the video wear traditional dance masks of “La Chonguinada” rituals from Peru and attempt to dance while being bitten by trained attacked dogs. Through this act, the dogs simultaneously become sculptural obstacles and dancers. The trained dogs, Belgian Malinois, have become the new darling and weapon for both the US military, Border Patrol and US law enforcement in their fight against terrorism and illegal immigration; and well known recently for being the dogs that helped capture and kill Osama Bin Laden. The musical narrative for the video is a free-form cumbia music composed by the artist and members of the Los Angeles-based band OJO that mixes hints of cumbia with electronic and ambient sounds. The video captures encounters between cultural memory and trauma by using both ritual and performance, yielding the appearance and disappearance of a hallucinatory narrative into a psychological sound experiment.","Eamon Ore-Giron’s paintings, works on paper and installations blend contemporary graphic design, folk and tourist art, and surrealism in a hybridity of Mexican, South American, Native-American, and other American cultures.

Yoshua Okón,"Canned Laughter was Okón’s response to an invitation from Ciudad Juárez that asked artists to create works based on their experience in the city. Okón focuses on Ciudad Juárez as a site for many “maquiladoras”—factories— and on its role within the global context. Canned Laughter is a detailed construction of Bergson, a fictitious factory that produces canned laughter for sitcoms. For it, dozens of ex-maquiladora workers were hired both as part of the research process (maquiladoras are highly secretive and it is very hard to know what happens inside) and as actors. Canned Laughter alludes to mechanized processes and to slavery in the age of globalization as well as to the impossibility to translate and reproduce true emotions though technological means.","Yoshua Okón’s video installations are built on improvisational narratives created by the artist and his collaborators—performers willing to participate in a game of social chance that may easily spiral out of control. These works provoke viewers to consider questions of social conduct and personal behavior within the context of the authoritative nation-state. Okón places pressure on viewers to question their own attitudes towards power, ethics, and prejudice vis-á-vis class, status, and marginality.",Canned Laughter,Americas,"['procedure.n.01', 'age.n.01', 'actor.n.01', 'global.s.01', 'construction.n.01', 'artist.n.01', 'function.n.03', 'establish.v.08', 'context.n.01', 'experience.n.01', 'city.n.01', 'make.v.03']","['automation.n.02', 'labor.n.01', 'parody.n.02', 'improvisation.n.01', 'artificiality.n.01', 'globalization.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/yoshua_okon_canned_laughter.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/yoshua_okon_canned_laughter-300x200.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/canned-laughter/,"['Cultural/8.063603063603063', 'Society/5.205128205128205', 'Politics/4.038461538461539']","['Cultural', 'Society', 'Politics']",17.30719280719281,"['Arts/5.6064602064602065', 'Power/3.269230769230769', 'Economy/2.769230769230769']","['Arts', 'Power', 'Economy']",11.644921744921746,"['Cultural/14.395934784170082', 'Society/10.961344537815126', 'Individual_Personal/7.421978021978021']","['Cultural', 'Society', 'Individual_Personal']",32.77925734396323,"['Arts/5.534640522875817', 'Culture/4.118681318681318', 'Urbanization/3.623529411764706']","['Arts', 'Culture', 'Urbanization']",13.27685125332184,0.6666666666666666,0.3333333333333333

Jennifer Locke,"Choke documents the artist filming a wrestler “choking out” his teammate until he is unconscious. This closed circuit of dominance and submission between two powerful men, is echoed by the closed circuit of the video through which the viewer takes on the role of voyeur. The artist’s presence in the piece not only calls attention to its staging, but inverts the traditional power dynamic of the “male gaze” and gender roles.","Working in video and installation-based performance, Jennifer Locke stages physically intense actions in relation to the camera and specific architecture in order to explore the unstable nature of artist/model/camera/audience hierarchies. These actions focus on cycles of physicality and visibility, and draw from her experiences as a professional dominatrix, champion submission wrestler, and artist’s model. Locke often creates a separation between her live actions and the audience through the use of material barriers, live video feeds, multiple camera perspectives, wireless microphones, and mini-cameras. These audio-visual reiterations produce a ripple effect, flattening, repeating, echoing, amplifying, and displacing the action by turning it —as well as the audience performing its own spectatorship— into an image of itself.",Choke,Americas,"['function.n.03', 'gaze.n.01', 'traditional.a.01', 'document.n.01', 'attention.n.01', 'power.n.01', 'presence.n.01', 'spectator.n.01', 'piece.n.01', 'video.n.01']","['sex.n.04', 'wrestling.n.02', 'voyeurism.n.01', 'violence.n.01', 'gaze.n.01', 'film.v.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/jennifer_locke_choke_.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/jennifer_locke_choke_-300x204.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/choke/,"['Individual_Personal/4.8', 'Society/2.7411764705882353', 'Politics/2.541176470588235']","['Individual_Personal', 'Society', 'Politics']",10.08235294117647,"['Body/3.0', 'Violence/1.9411764705882353', 'Activism/1.7411764705882353']","['Body', 'Violence', 'Activism']",6.682352941176471,"['Material_Physical/6.825940725940725', 'Cultural/6.376923076923077', 'Individual_Personal/5.123809523809523']","['Material_Physical', 'Cultural', 'Individual_Personal']",18.326673326673326,"['Materiality/3.4025641025641025', 'Power/2.511655011655012', 'Language/2.307692307692308']","['Materiality', 'Power', 'Language']",8.221911421911422,0.3333333333333333,0.0
