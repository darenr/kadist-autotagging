Allora & Calzadilla,"This series of photographs is part of the body of work Allora & Calzadilla made regarding the situation in Vieques, an island off the mainland of Puerto Rico used for the 60 years by the U.S Military and NATO forces to practice military bombing exercises. In 2000, they began a collaboration with the local activists to make the campaign more visible. Having added cast rubber reliefs of their slogans and designs to the soles of their shoes, the activists stamped their protest on the reclaimed land. By slightly manipulating everyday objects to become communication tools, Allora & Calzadilla had created “mobile print-making machines” (Yates McKee, October 133, Summer 2010). They then photographed the ephemeral aftermath of these mark-making actions.  Like graffitied walls, the details of these impressions on sandy grounds are landscapes of dissent, willing the transition of propriety back to the inhabitants. In Land Mark #12, numerous footsteps with long statements stamp their resentment in different confused orientations. Such a beach scene might at first misleadingly be associated with a playful holiday snap. The fragility, uncertainty and relentlessness of this struggle is poetically summarized in this close-up of meaningful site-specific expression. The artists wrote: “How is land differentiated from other land by the way it is marked? Who decides what is worth preserving and what should be destroyed? What are the strategies for reclaiming marked land? How does one articulate an ethics and politics of land use?” (in Land Mark, de Tokyo, Paris, 2006).","Jennifer Allora and Guillermo Calzadilla comprise the artistic duo Allora & Calzadilla. Their work often takes the form of performances, installations, and sound pieces that refer to sociopolitical phenomena and history.

Gabriel Kuri,"Gabriel Kuri has created a series of works in which he juxtaposes perennial and ephemeral materials. Untitled (Ticket Roll) belongs to this group of sculptures and consists of three smooth ornate marble elements and a roll of public transport tickets. The artist poetically associates finesse and fragility as in a number of these works. Here the line of the ticket roll, partly unraveled, is held down by the balancing marble elements thus creating an interdependence between elements de different natures.

Renee Rhodes,"The artist writes about her work: “There is an endless desire to know what we look like from outer space and many of us have evolved into a species that exists across the disorienting spaces and timeframes of virtuality. Within my current work, dance and simple movement scores act as a language for simultaneously collecting, mapping and producing volumes of information and knowledge. Moving makes a map and performing is observation. Digital mediations translate bodies into uncanny organisms and minimal dances become distant accumulations of pixelated information. Entanglements between human physicality, technology and natural systems are imagined through a playful aesthetics of information. As every last body and landscape is mapped and measured, through rigorous technologies of ever increasing distance, I look for the newly emerging territories that mineralize at the intersections of the virtual and the physical. These are the territories that we live in, archived in the memory drives of muscles, or through endlessly shifting choreographies of information.”","Renée Rhodes grew up amidst the fantasy and rigor that is the world of classical ballet.

Fiamma Montezemolo,"Montemozolo writes of the work: “Fireflies is the result of a sudden event—and its transformation/translation into an art work—that erupts within a life, altering its flow, suspending it, creating a momentary intensity and deviation of the flow, channeling it somewhere unexpected. This unforeseen deviation is dissected in terms of affects in the time frame of 5 minutes. The affects that emerge in the piece are characterized by a sense of movement between pain and hope, and a work of association between cancer and expectancy. The concept of resistance and fireflies is taken from [Georges] Didi-Huberman’s work on the political relevance of the survival of fireflies as a metaphor for the contemporary importance of an intermittent resistance opposed to an inoperable, redemptive, absolute one.”","Born in Rome, Fiamma Montezemolo is both a cultural anthropologist (PhD, University of Naples)  and an artist (MFA, San Francisco Art Institute). Not surprisingly then, she situates her art practice as a critical response to the “ethnographic turn” that was prevalent in contemporary art during the 1990s. In addition to ethnography—a research method adopted as a “medium” by many artists—Montezemolo works with various media including installation, cartography, video, digital photography, industrial materials, performance, and archival documents.

Mladen Stilinovic,"The Exploitation of the Dead cycle is composed of a very large number of elements which the artist reorganizes differently every time. The installation is presented like a “parade of objects”, with images whose historical role has been suspended or their meaning has changed. The references have become lost, through repetition the works have become banal. One can find copies of Suprematist or Social Realist paintings, collages, photographs of political meetings, cemeteries or other memorials. We are confronted with the obsolescence of signs. Colors like red and black have also lost their meaning.  Exploitation of the Dead concerns today’s religious or ideological ideas which are only extensions of religions and ideologies of the past and definitively dead. Mladen Stilinovic insists that: “If death has to be exploited, this is a violent act and we need to weigh up the consequences.” Collective rituals are central since they evoke a certain collective emotion which can’t quite be attained through signs and colors. This work is a way to think about painting but also the modalities of its exhibition. There is also this question of the copy. Why and how do we copy things? What do we learn through repetition ? About loss of integrity ?","Mladen Stilinovic’s work is based on social and political critique, with a healthy dose of irony. He was part of Grupa šestorice autora (Group of Six Authors), active in Zagreb between 1975 and 1979. He also ran the Extended Media Gallery from 1981 to 1991. His work is deeply rooted in the rites that reveal the interdependence of private and public spheres. He is particularly interested in the interaction between visual and linguistic signs as well as in the mechanisms of deconstruction in language. His polymorphic approach finds varied manifestations from collages, installations, photographs, books, performances, actions in public space as well as participations in collective actions.

Brenna Youngblood,"Brenna Youngblood’s chromogenic print Red Door (2007) is representative of the artist’s interest in conceptual photography; she also works in multimedia collage and assemblage, drawing imagery from the everyday and giving new meanings to seemingly mundane objects and places. The image of a red door inspires a tension between potential meaning and purposeful ambiguity, leaving the viewer to wonder about her formal decisions. The color red on a door is often used to symbolize good luck, and in almost every culture, means “welcome.” Some say a red door was a sign of a safe house on the Underground Railroad.","Brenna Youngblood’s images reflect the experiences of a working-class woman of color growing up in Central California and eventually landing in Los Angeles. Ironically, her photo collages, assemblages, and paintings have often been compared to the work of Robert Rauschenberg or Richard Prince, but they are closer in spirit with more contemporary artists like Mark Bradford.

Francis Alÿs,,"Trained as an architect, Alÿs turned to a visual arts based practice in the early 1990s as a more immediate, direct, and effective way of exploring issues related to urbanization, to the ordering and signification of urban space and to the semiotics of its use. His work initiates with a simple action, either by him or others, which is then documented in a range of media. Alÿs explores subjects such as modernizing programs in Latin America and border zones in areas of conflict, often asking about the relevance of poetic acts in politicized situations. Documentation is central to his practice as well as painting, drawing, and video.

Francis Alÿs,,"Trained as an architect, Alÿs turned to a visual arts based practice in the early 1990s as a more immediate, direct, and effective way of exploring issues related to urbanization, to the ordering and signification of urban space and to the semiotics of its use. His work initiates with a simple action, either by him or others, which is then documented in a range of media. Alÿs explores subjects such as modernizing programs in Latin America and border zones in areas of conflict, often asking about the relevance of poetic acts in politicized situations. Documentation is central to his practice as well as painting, drawing, and video.

Currently housed at City College of San Francisco as a permanent installation, for a time it was in storage and not on public display.During the same period, he created the charcoal sketchentitled Shasta (1940), of large construction machinery that the artist saw near the Mount Shasta dam. He noted the dam and construction equipment as playing a role also in the lives of those living in South Americas.","Diego Rivera was one of the most important artists of the 20th century. He lived and worked for most of his life in Mexico, although he also traveled extensively to such places as Russia, America, France, and Spain. He was (twice) married to the (also extremely famous) Mexican painter Frida Kahlo.

Gabriel Orozco,"Charco portátil congelado (Frozen Portable Puddle, 1994) is a photographic record of an installation of the same name that Gabriel Orozco made at Witte de With Center for Contemporary Art in Rotterdam for the group exhibition WATT (1994). The artist arrived a week prior to the opening with no artwork to install, and created three spontaneous works from locally sourced materials. This one was made of white plastic record sleeves that Orozco arranged on the damp roof of the gallery. He left it out overnight, and by morning there was a layer of ice coating it—a serendipitous frozen portable puddle. The work highlights Orozco’s flexible practice and trust in chance encounters.","Gabriel Orozco could be described as a traveler-artist, without a fixed studio. He works following contexts and produces work that flows. “Special Service” (1997) is a collage on a plane ticket, and indicates nomadism, between territories. The artist, who is the son of muralist Mario Orozco Riviera, questions the boundaries of his artistic identity in Mexico. In “Crazy tourist” (1991), Orozco creates a situation with oranges in the Brazilian market tables in a desert. The artist uses objects or “poor” situations, found in the everyday landscape, natural or urban. By their division, their juxtaposition, or collage, inventing semantic or sensitive scenarios, always surprising, sometimes humorous and sometimes lyrical … The sculptural practice of the artist, inseparable from his drawings, photographs, or films, invents relationships of space, and disrupts our perception of objects.

Mateo Lopez,"Mateo Lopez uses paper as a medium to conjure personal experiences. The artist creates drawings and trompe l’oeil objects, ranging from apples to clothing hangers to doors. These props are part of a performance; he often sets up his studio in public and uses cues from his own journeys as the inspiration for his work. The objects are not dull, but sensuous, creating their own life in a Proustian narrative; slices of apple, for instance, have texture summoning the juiciness of a crisp bite. Lopez carefully creates these phantom objects and imbues them with the colors of memory. Almohada means “pillow” in Spanish, and this 2011 sculpture is a literal and playful interpretation. The large pillow made of sheets of paper leans vertically against a wall, and papers printed with images of feathers spill over the top and cascade onto the floor.","Though he often works with paper and traditional techniques such as lithography, Mateo López is interested in expanding the scope of drawing and frequently operates outside of traditional studio situations to conjure personal experiences. His early studies in architecture equipped him to consider his medium in terms of time and space, and in three rather than two dimensions. The portability of López’s methods, along with his personal approach to collecting information from his personal journeys, has become a trademark of his installations.

Early in his career he made traditional, non-realistic, colorful, large-scale paintings that depicted everyday objects. Many of these took a somewhat critical tone that specifically addressed the cultural and societal dilemmas facing Brazil and its contemporary citizenry. He moved on to making sewn assemblages made out of materials such as buttons, stones, cloth, canvas, copper wire, and thread.

Hank Willis Thomas,"South Africa Righteous Space by Hank Willis Thomas is concerned with history and identity, with the way race and ‘blackness’ has not only been informed but deliberately shaped and constructed by various forces – first through colonialism and slavery, and more recently through mass media and advertising – and reminds us of the financial and economic stakes that have always been involved in representations of race.","Employing the visual language and terminology of mass media, and appropriating symbols and images from popular culture, Hank Willis Thomas’ work seeks to question and subvert established definitions and positions with regards to personal identity and the narrative of race. Working across installation, photography, video, and media work, Thomas maintains his photo conceptualist roots, primarily taking source material from found photographs and archives. These images form the basis from which the artist seeks to uncover the fallacies that history claims as truth. His work illustrates how the way history is represented and consumed reinforces generalizations surrounding identity, gender, race and ethnicity, and that as an artist he has an opportunity to expose or to revise those histories from the points of view of the oppressed.",South Africa Righteous Space,Americas,"['race.n.01', 'south_africa.n.01', 'south.n.01 africa.n.01', 'force.n.01', 'ad.n.01', 'mass.n.01', 'black.n.01', 'africa.n.01', 'south.n.01', 'economic.a.01', 'construct.v.01', 'representation.n.01', 'identity.n.01', 'medium.n.01', 'history.n.01', 'space.n.01']","['history.n.02', 'identity.n.01', 'race.n.03', 'colonialism.n.01', 'slavery.n.02', 'ad.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/IMG_HWT14.007_d-HR_WEB.png,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/IMG_HWT14.007_d-HR_WEB-300x200.png,https://kadist.org/work/south-africa-righteous-space/,"['Society/12.637179959703179', 'Individual_Personal/8.167210567210567', 'Cultural/4.876307189542484']","['Society', 'Individual_Personal', 'Cultural']",25.68069771645623,"['Identity/6.567210567210568', 'Colonization/3.5555555555555554', 'Culture/3.2763071895424836']","['Identity', 'Colonization', 'Culture']",13.399073312308607,"['Material_Physical/24.97720349825613', 'Cultural/17.781291747468224', 'Individual_Personal/15.264646464646471']","['Material_Physical', 'Cultural', 'Individual_Personal']",58.02314171037082,"['Land/15.463839084891717', 'Media/7.761877828054297', 'Mind/4.9282051282051285']","['Land', 'Media', 'Mind']",28.15392204115114,0.6666666666666666,0.0

Eric Baudelaire,"Baudelaire’s latest film, Also known as Jihadi (2017) tells the story of a young French boy from Parisian suburbs and his assumed journey to the Al-Nusra front in Syria to join ISIS and fight Bashar al-Assad’s regime. Employing the cinematographic approach known as ‘landscape theory’ — or fûkeiron — developed out of Marxist film criticism in the 1970s where the landscape of a film is read as an expression of the political climate, thus becoming a significant character, motivation or reasoning for the films development. The 101-minute follows Abdel Aziz from the socially and politically rife milieu of the Parisian suburbs, weighted by division, segregation, development and poverty to, what the viewer assumes, Syria. Following landscape theory, the viewer does not see Aziz, rather his story is told through different landscapes, filmed in France, Spain, Algeria, and on the Syrian border in Turkey. The viewer is caught in a maelstrom of perceptions and realities, the aimlessness and alienation heavily felt in segregated communities, how society and the media define a terrorist or jihadist, and attempts to understand the motivations of the various evils experienced in our shared political condition. A grid of photocopied transcripts accompanies the film from Abdel Aziz trial that took place only weeks after the attack at the Bataclan in Paris in October 2015.","Currently based in Paris, Franco-American artist Eric Baudelaire has developed an oeuvre primarily composed of film, but which also includes photography, silkscreen prints, performance, publications and installations. In his research-based practice, the artist examines the relationship between images, past events and their documentation. Interested in the role of the cinematographic image as an index marker, Baudelaire creates narratives in which recorded facts serve as a starting point for an exploration of the unknown. In examining the changes in human behavior though interrogating the great political structures that govern the global, national and micro-communities, Baudelaire’s practice could be read through a bio-political perspective. Navigating the experience of urban living, the global, technical and economic dependencies of war, movement and the contemporary paradigm of geographical proximity and distance, Baudelaire’s practice evokes a hauntingly provocative perspective on the current political climate.",Also Known As Jihadi,Europe,"['development.n.01', 'landscape.n.01', 'movie.n.01', 'spectator.n.01', 'political.a.01', 'grid.n.01', 'narrative.n.01', 'milieu.n.01', 'male_child.n.01', 'french.a.01', 'film.v.01', 'read.v.01', 'percept.n.01', 'journey.n.01', 'boundary_line.n.01', 'paris.n.01', 'expression.n.01', 'approach.n.01', 'government.n.01', 'community.n.01', 'attempt.n.01', 'society.n.01', 'fictional_character.n.01', 'medium.n.01', 'world.n.03']","['landscape.n.01', 'politics.n.01', 'segregation.n.01', 'radicalize.v.01', 'terrorism.n.01', 'poverty.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/alsoknownasjihadi_20449543_eb_alsoknownasjihadi_2017_still16a-455x190@2x.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/alsoknownasjihadi_20449543_eb_alsoknownasjihadi_2017_still16a-455x190@2x-300x126.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/also-known-as-jihadi/,"['Politics/4.3076923076923075', 'Society/2.658119658119658', 'Material_Physical/1.8']","['Politics', 'Society', 'Material_Physical']",8.765811965811967,"['Power/2.307692307692308', 'Urbanization/1.658119658119658', 'Politics/1.0']","['Power', 'Urbanization', 'Politics']",4.965811965811966,"['Cultural/38.359405609869995', 'Society/18.554072827757043', 'Individual_Personal/16.320807297277888']","['Cultural', 'Society', 'Individual_Personal']",73.23428573490492,"['Media/12.669875386051858', 'Arts/7.594627594627594', 'Culture/6.2725274725274724']","['Media', 'Arts', 'Culture']",26.537030453206924,0.3333333333333333,0.0
Matthew Langan Peck,"Plane is an inflatable sculpture in the shape of an aeroplane made from numerous pieces of plastic bags assembled by an iron. The object is inflated by a fan at the structures base and deflates when it is deprived of its power source, causing the plane to sink. It is in this process that plane leans on its wings, evoking a crash, a defeat, or a failure. In interrogating the economy of materiality and representation, Plane toys with the notion of aeroplanes as mode of transportation, while the installation counters that which it resembles with the work itself is easily assembled, transported and reproduced. Equally, the installation evokes questions of waste and man-made objects and material, the impact of unrecyclable matter on the environment, and the role of the artist exploiting alternative modes and methods for installation.","The practice of Matthew Langan-Peck (b. 1988), currently based in New York, traverses drawing, installation and painting. Through manipulating and experimenting with materials and space, the artist explores the economy of installation, ad-hoc materiality and space occupation. The artist makes peculiar, amusing and almost childish objects from simple shapes and materials. While the objects in his installations are too big to be games, often embarrassing by their volumes, and some may seem ridiculous; the objects contain an opposition — or a tension — that combines playfulness with the fragility of life. They are, at once, ambitious gestures of power and delicate assemblages of waste and recycled materials. If this practice is reminiscent of Claes Oldenburg, the works of Matthew Langan-Peck are imprinted with a resigned poetry. The modesty of the work and the fragility of the forms bear a tragi-comic resonance heightened by his evocation of a possible disappearance.",Plane,Europe,"['airplane.n.01', 'manner.n.01', 'plastic.n.01', 'object.n.01', 'method.n.01', 'matter.n.01', 'economy.n.01', 'impact.n.01', 'environment.n.01', 'beginning.n.04', 'structure.n.01', 'shape.n.01', 'impression.n.01', 'function.n.03', 'representation.n.01', 'power.n.01', 'procedure.n.01', 'question.n.01', 'material.n.01', 'sculpture.n.01', 'piece.n.01']","['failure.n.01', 'materiality.n.02', 'transportation_system.n.01', 'waste.n.01', 'environment.n.02', 'pollution.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Langan-Peck-LOW.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Langan-Peck-LOW-300x200.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/plane/,"['Material_Physical/13.614585414585417', 'Society/4.107692307692307', 'Politics/3.1076923076923078']","['Material_Physical', 'Society', 'Politics']",20.82997002997003,"['Land/6.421978021978021', 'Environmental/3.7142857142857144', 'Materiality/2.6783216783216783']","['Land', 'Environmental', 'Materiality']",12.814585414585414,"['Cultural/31.701790203260806', 'Individual_Personal/24.939468864468875', 'Society/14.158327946563244']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Society']",70.79958701429292,"['Arts/10.629054442289739', 'Culture/8.011843711843712', 'Economy/7.4550312432665375']","['Arts', 'Culture', 'Economy']",26.095929397399992,0.3333333333333333,0.0
Chris Huen Sin-Kan,"Contrast to the bustling and unrelenting experience of a city such as Hong Kong, Chris Huen Sin Kan paints the tranquil interiors of his apartment, where he leads a modest and almost hermit-like life. He does not try to capture a particular moment, but rather the simultaneously changes that occur before him in time, exploring the nuances of light and reflections and recording movements in his apartment, his dog’s behavior and reactions, the way his plant change over time, all in an attempt to find a visual expression of his cognitive experience. Doodood and John are the names of his dog and the plant. His compositions are organic and are un-staged. What Huen presents is the hidden side of life in Hong Kong, painted with extraordinary competence for someone so young, where the paint vibrates on the canvas as though never coming to rest. Experiencing the nuances of looking through painting, Huen builds an archive of the experiential phenomena of life.","Chris Huen Sin-Kan (b. 1991, Hong Kong) currently lives and works in Hong Kong. His paintings are characterised by his pursuit to capture the details and minutiae of everyday life. Huen meticulously observes personal, and yet, commonplace occurrences drawn from his studio/home. He seldom plans for a painting; keeping his brush strokes gestural and light as he works to catch a moment before it passes.

Lola Gonzàlez,"In Summer Camp, Lola Gonzàlez filmed a group of friends at the home of her parents in the department of Charente (France) in the process of transforming the house into a training camp. They are doing exercises with the furniture as if they were training to fight against something yet to happen. Gonzàlez’s films persistently evoke the same fear of an external threat, one which is never explained but which can be placed in relation with the current political situation and social tension. In the film, we see group writing unidentifiable names on the walls, heightening the unknowingness of the situation to which we bear witness. Although the film has been shot some months before the October 2015 terrorist attacks in Paris, we cannot help reading this piece in relation with the recent events, which give to the film the feeling of a collective prayer.","Lola Gonzàlez (b. 1988, Angoulême) is a young French artist working mainly with film. Her departure point is often the same: four, ten, or sometimes more people, are secluded from the cities. Impossible to know who they are or what binds them together. Are they fugitives or utopians? Yet, understanding where their actions lead is almost irrelevant, rather one is invited to examine the process and experience of learning to live together and of learning to struggle against an invisible threat. In portraying the same group of people, often in a same location — her parents’ house in the region of Charente, France that itself becomes a character — her practice reflects the complicity with her friends and members of her family who improvise as actors, emphasizing the formation of a community, friendship or collective action as positionality. Gonzàlez explains, “We’ve grown accustomed to a neutral concept of friendship as a form of fondness without consequence whereas all affinity is in fact a bond within a common truth.” Nurtured by the emotional ties that animate her community, Gonzàlez’s search for a common truth embodies a new, chosen version of a reality whereby the deadly injunction to “get real” is indeed tirelessly fought.",Summer Camp,Europe,"['relation.n.01', 'situation.n.01', 'movie.n.01', 'shoot.v.01', 'fear.n.01', 'current.a.01', 'paris.n.01', 'tension.n.01', 'corporate.s.03', 'house.n.01', 'event.n.01', 'wall.n.01', 'procedure.n.01', 'political.a.01', 'piece.n.01', 'social.a.01']","['community.n.01', 'collective.n.01', 'alliance.n.02', 'movement.n.04', 'animalism.n.02', 'friendship.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Summercamp2low.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Summercamp2low-300x188.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/summer-camp/,"['Society/8.725641025641025', 'Politics/1.6333333333333333', 'Material_Physical/1.0']","['Society', 'Politics', 'Material_Physical']",11.358974358974358,"['Community/4.6', 'Urbanization/1.6923076923076925', 'Materiality/1.0']","['Community', 'Urbanization', 'Materiality']",7.292307692307692,"['Individual_Personal/19.632018961430735', 'Society/19.32994505494506', 'Cultural/18.211197299432598']","['Individual_Personal', 'Society', 'Cultural']",57.17316131580839,"['Emotion/11.343223443223446', 'Arts/6.830672268907563', 'Media/4.984920634920635']","['Emotion', 'Arts', 'Media']",23.15881634705164,0.3333333333333333,0.0
Adelita Husni-Bey,"After the Finish Line is a recent film by Adelita Husni-Bey produced for the exhibition Movement Break at Kadist-SF in 2015. It was developed in collaboration with a group of teenage athletes who have experienced injury as a result of their respective sporting activities. Through radical pedagogical practice, a process that attempts to de-individualize feelings of failure, the artist and the athletes recorded their experiences, discussing the meaning and trappings of competition — and in particular, from where desires for success stem. The film alternates between two distinct styles: one associated to sport-branded slick advertisements, and the other one to an experimental documentary approach. Linking these approaches together is the running conversation between Adelita Husni-Bey and the teenagers where they analyze the effect of pain, their consequent failure as athletes, and what it means for them to compete. The artist pictures the athletes as perfect machines whose gestures are full of tension for the imminent performance, whose eyes are sharp and focused. Then, she exposes how the teenagers — after experiencing a body defeat — experience a psychological breakdown. The film’s subject of sport operates as a larger metaphor for the endless performance of life. Being an athlete is like being the perfect human being, and particularly in the American milieu, where the athletic ideal is an image deeply interconnected to success.","Born in Milan, Italian-Libyan Adelita Husni-Bey is an artist and researcher. Her practice, which encompasses drawing, painting, collage, video, and participatory workshops, concentrates on micro-utopias, and on how the collective memory works as well as questioning the mechanisms of political and economic power and control.  Her background in sociology as well as fine arts has helped in criticizing prevailing systems of organization of advanced capitalist societies in areas such as labour, schooling and housing. She questions the type of visibility there is in producing an artwork on ‘under-represented communities’, and looks for alternatives as a form of reaction to the way Western society is structured. In that sense, her role as an artist strives to instigate reflection on, and effectively produce, alternative social imaginaries.",After the Finish Line,Europe,"['approach.n.01', 'performance.n.01', 'movie.n.01', 'experience.n.01', 'milieu.n.01', 'american.n.01', 'ad.n.01', 'psychological.s.01', 'injury.n.01', 'collaboration.n.01', 'activity.n.01', 'machine.n.01', 'conversation.n.01', 'documentary.a.01', 'eyes.n.01', 'desire.n.01', 'tension.n.01', 'metaphor.n.01', 'gesture.n.01', 'consequence.n.01', 'meaning.n.01', 'motion.n.03', 'subject.n.01', 'manner.n.01', 'practice.n.01']","['athleticism.n.01', 'pain.n.01', 'young_person.n.01', 'labor.n.01', 'body.n.01', 'psychology.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/kadist6.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/kadist6-300x158.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/after-the-finish-line/,"['Material_Physical/13.554260084600648', 'Cultural/7.5626418988648085', 'Society/5.211111111111111']","['Material_Physical', 'Cultural', 'Society']",26.32801309457657,"['Space/7.146153846153846', 'Physics/4.838875469216026', 'Arts/2.4248366013071894']","['Space', 'Physics', 'Arts']",14.409865916677061,"['Cultural/50.892762449109185', 'Individual_Personal/34.86160341206782', 'Society/31.157895681889496']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Society']",116.9122615430665,"['Arts/14.97557997557998', 'Emotion/13.981618381618386', 'Spirituality/9.151648351648353']","['Arts', 'Emotion', 'Spirituality']",38.10884670884672,0.6666666666666666,0.3333333333333333
Lu Pingyuan,"Masterpiece in the Water tells the story of an impatient collector killed by an artist and of this act of killing becoming an artwork as the story within the story sheds light on the psychological anxieties faced by soldiers during wartime, the family bond, and the supernormal. This semi-playful yet violent story explores the amusing similarity between supernatural events and the creation of artistic ideas, while reflecting on the complex relationships within the art world. It also exposes the power of superstitions, the existence of ghosts, and imagination as methods of survival. Through both its form (a story) and its various presentations in exhibitions, Lu’s work engages with key concerns in contemporary art, particularly materiality versus immateriality and narrative versus visual form.","Spanning videos, installations, paintings, performances, Lu Pingyuan’s practice has focused in recent years on writing short stories of fantasy often related to the art world. Partly-collected, partly-dreamed, his texts present enigmatic narrations, sometimes accompanied by fear. Often printing them on paper and pinning them to the wall, he has also adapted the presentation of these works to the contexts in conversation with the exhibitor, for example engraving them in stones or painting them on the wall.",Masterpiece in the Water,Asia,"['narrative.n.01', 'soldier.n.01', 'ghost.n.01', 'method.n.01', 'psychological.s.01', 'presentation.n.01', 'being.n.01', 'imagination.n.01', 'creation.n.01', 'form.n.01', 'water.n.01', 'complex.a.01', 'narrative.s.01', 'artwork.n.01', 'cardinal.s.01', 'event.n.01', 'family.n.01', 'relationship.n.01', 'idea.n.01', 'contemporary.s.01', 'power.n.01', 'ocular.a.02']","['narrative.n.01', 'materiality.n.02', 'family.n.02', 'war.n.01', 'psychology.n.01', 'supernatural.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_Lu-Pingyuan-Masterpiece-in-the-Water_OCAT-Shanghai-2016_03-web.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_Lu-Pingyuan-Masterpiece-in-the-Water_OCAT-Shanghai-2016_03-web-300x200.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/masterpiece-in-the-water/,"['Cultural/10.47173280795572', 'Society/7.826307189542483', 'Material_Physical/7.55520619731146']","['Cultural', 'Society', 'Material_Physical']",25.85324619480966,"['Physics/3.246115288220551', 'Fantasy/2.909090909090909', 'War/2.75']","['Physics', 'Fantasy', 'War']",8.905206197311461,"['Individual_Personal/32.10765068265069', 'Cultural/28.82895176718707', 'Politics/14.639402264402266']","['Individual_Personal', 'Cultural', 'Politics']",75.57600471424003,"['Spirituality/9.254695304695305', 'Power/8.107259407259408', 'Fantasy/7.206313131313131']","['Spirituality', 'Power', 'Fantasy']",24.568267843267844,0.3333333333333333,0.3333333333333333
Jibade-Khalil Huffman,"Jibade-Khalil Huffman’s work brings together spoken and written language, photography, vintage television and computer animation to pay homage to African-American popular culture. Figuration (B) is a mediatic dumpster dive through the not-yet-historical past, its fantasia of purloined images flowing to an interruptive, channel-surfing logic. A stream of TV clips, commercials, news segments, video memes, and movie scenes—at times run backwards, doubled, or layered over other clips—incorporate archival and pop cultural sources layered with a soundtrack constructed of found and made sources to make something akin to a video mixtape. With it, the artist (who has also published three collections of poetry) aims to flatten hierarchies of form as well as those that emerge among his far-flung source materials, by turns pop, esoteric, and vernacular.   Figuration (B) opens with the throbbing baseline from the title track of the 1980 cult film Flash Gordon, composed, produced, and performed by Queen; a Colt 45 advertisement; Scarface; Will Farrell tranquilized in Old School; the basketball player Isiah Thomas strangling his coach in 1989; Jeru the Damaja’s song Invasion and Dolly Parton’s 9 to 5; and a program in which a boy exclaims “Hey, aren’t you Frederick Douglass?” All of this is distorted or filtered through hazy pinks and greens, and it dissolves, on occasion, into graphic geometry. For all the accessible humor, pop imagery, and antiracist politics of Huffman’s work, its poetic excess of aesthetic, cultural, and semantic input accumulates into an opaque mass, overwhelming expedient readings.","Jibade-Khalil Huffman uses performance, photography, and video that pushes the capabilities of text and image to tell stories and convey meaning.

Aimée Zito Lema,"Rond de Jambe is a series formed by two works: a 3-channel video installation and a live performance. Each work of the same project approach the same subject matter through a different medium in order to investigate politics as they are made manifest in and through the body. Using archival footage of protests of the Stopera building project in Amsterdam as a starting point, Aimée Zito Lema worked with dancers to translate the protest movements into a choreography. The Stopera Building was built between 1979 and 1986 to house both the city hall of Amsterdam and the Dutch National Opera and Ballet. The building project was met with heavy protests from local left-wing groups who argued that the space should be used for social purposes and housing, rather than those that only serve an elite or privileged class. The opposition claimed that it had been planned without any historical and social awareness, ignoring the traumatic history of the area marked by WWII. This work is indicative of Zito Lema’s practice, and her interest in the way in which the history of socio-political events are documented, recalled through representation, and activated through new juxtapositions and material form.","Aimée Zito Lema explores collective memory and knowledge, and the ways in which it is transmitted from one generation to the next. Her work consisting of performance, video, sculpture, installation, and photography often uses the body, or representations of the body, to generate questions about our relationship to history, how it is recorded and remembered. Her practice is primarily motivated by research into social forms of resistance and the political body, learning from revolutionary and guerrilla movements in history.",Ronde de Jambe,Americas,"['protest.n.01', 'building.n.01', 'undertaking.n.01', 'social.a.01', 'remember.v.01', 'form.v.01', 'history.n.01', 'purpose.n.01', 'capable.s.02', 'matter.n.01', 'class.n.01', 'footage.n.01', 'resistance.n.01', 'politics.n.01', 'local.a.01', 'house.n.01', 'event.n.01', 'construct.v.01', 'historical.a.01', 'representation.n.01', 'motion.n.03', 'medium.n.01', 'performance.n.01', 'practice.n.01', 'city.n.01']","['politics.n.01', 'body.n.01', 'protest.n.01', 'motion.n.03', 'injury.n.01', 'memory.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_AZL_Documenta_web.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_AZL_Documenta_web-300x200.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/ronde-de-jambe/,"['Material_Physical/11.452869352869353', 'Politics/8.477614379084967', 'Individual_Personal/7.0377096587622905']","['Material_Physical', 'Politics', 'Individual_Personal']",26.968193390716607,"['Space/6.346153846153846', 'Body/3.699248120300752', 'Geopolitics/3.2026143790849675']","['Space', 'Body', 'Geopolitics']",13.248016345539565,"['Cultural/42.62285606550311', 'Society/29.672261725202908', 'Individual_Personal/25.49317184363625']","['Cultural', 'Society', 'Individual_Personal']",97.78828963434226,"['Arts/12.10127666451196', 'Media/10.988251454427923', 'Culture/9.042399267399269']","['Arts', 'Media', 'Culture']",32.13192738633915,0.3333333333333333,0.0

Kiluanji Kia Henda,"Redefining The Power (with Didi Fernandes) is a metaphor of how reflections on history and society during the Angolan Civil War (1975-2002) are largely ignored within the canon of history. Resulting from Kia Henda’s research on the Fortaleza de São Miguel built by the Portuguese in the 15th century in Luanda, Angola, the Redefining The Power series was created 10 years after the Angolan Civil War as a reflection on the reactivation of memory surrounding historical monuments. Through this work, the artist aims to replace the memorialized colonial heroes and war symbols through re-appropriation, determining traumatized lands as forms of resistance and pride. Kia Henda seeks out empty monument pedestals and invites loved ones and celebrated Angolan personalities to participate in stylized performances— the figure portrayed here, Didi Fernandes, is an Angolan designer and activist. These photographs freeze the moments of creativity as actions of reclaiming once abandoned public spaces. At once true, documentary and fictional, this series brings together the historical context with our contemporary moment.","A self-taught artist, Kiluanji Kia Henda employs a strong sense of humour in his work, which often hones in on themes of identity, politics, and perceptions of post-colonialism and modernism in Africa. Practicing in the fields of photography, video, and performance, Kiluanji Kia Henda has tied his multidisciplinary approach to a sharp sense of criticality. In complicity with historical legacy, Kia Henda realizes the process of appropriation and manipulation of public spaces, and the different representations that form part of collective memory.",Redefining The Power (with Didi Fernandes),Middle East & Africa,"['memorial.n.03', 'war.n.01', 'contemplation.n.02', 'moment.n.01', 'historical.a.01', 'power.n.01', 'militant.n.01', 'history.n.01', 'fictional.a.01', 'documentary.a.01', 'resistance.n.01', 'land.n.01', 'symbol.n.01', 'metaphor.n.01', 'century.n.01', 'series.n.01', 'society.n.01', 'construct.v.01', 'action.n.01', 'public.a.01', 'contemporary.s.01', 'memory.n.01', 'context.n.01', 'figure.n.01', 'make.v.03']","['civil_war.n.01', 'memorial.n.03', 'colonialism.n.01', 'trauma.n.02', 'resistance.n.01', 'reclaim.v.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/RedefingThePower-light.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/RedefingThePower-light-199x300.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/redefining-the-power-with-didi-fernandes/,"['Society/14.344712459882743', 'Politics/6.016965490649701', 'Individual_Personal/4.94065934065934']","['Society', 'Politics', 'Individual_Personal']",25.302337291191787,"['Violence/5.043412452700378', 'War/3.3501400560224086', 'Power/3.307692307692308']","['Violence', 'War', 'Power']",11.701244816415095,"['Society/17.780763843999143', 'Individual_Personal/17.27328417196839', 'Cultural/16.198650472334684']","['Society', 'Individual_Personal', 'Cultural']",51.252698488302215,"['Time/7.155977355977355', 'Power/6.742424242424243', 'Mind/4.36082995951417']","['Time', 'Power', 'Mind']",18.25923155791577,0.6666666666666666,0.3333333333333333
Laura Henno,"In 2009, Laura Henno began research in the archipelago Comoros for her first film Koropa the first episode of a triptych— completed in 2016. Mayotte is the only remaining island belonging to France in the archipelago of the Comoros, which gained independence in 1975, creating an invisible border that divides the islands from Europe. Koropa is the portrait of a particular relationship: that of Ben, a former fisherman turned smuggler, and Patron, a child who makes his first smuggling voyage between the island of Anjouan and Mayotte. The film presents a silent rite of passage, this solemn apprenticeship, and the transmission of knowledge that owes as much to the cunning as to the art of sailing over a hostile ocean. By its brief and radical form, its abstract space, the film escapes from the documentary format to draw an ancient drama, where two mute figures, that of the father and the son, share a journey on the verge of death.","Laura Henno was trained as a photographer and studied film at Le Fresnoy – Studio National des Arts Contemporains. For several years, she has based her approach to photography and film on the issues of clandestine migration, in the Comoros, Réunion Island ; Calais ; and Rome.

Gaëlle Choisne,"Entre Chien et Loup is an installation incorporating a variety of media: rubber, discs, feathers and confetti that the artist weaves, sews and glues together. Influenced by Mike Kelley’s Memory Ware series, the artist creates an object-memory from found materials. The found objects used recall the artist’s mother – it is somehow her portrait, her cape-. Choisne’s mother was born in Haiti and migrated to France with her husband. She landed in Cherbourg, Brittany where she became “the foreigner” by her country of origin and her skin color. The work too is a tribute to the artist Sun Ra, his costumes and the Afrofuturism movement of which he is an emblematic figure. In this work, Choisne presents her mother as a figure of Afrofuturism. The expression Entre Chien et Loup refers to the moment when in dim light, one can no longer distinguish between a dog and a wolf. Here, in references to the figures that populate the installation -the artist’s mother and Sun Ra- they become indistinguishable.","The work of Gaëlle Choisne addresses the disorders of the world: dis­aster, the exploita­tion of resources and the remains of colo­nialism. Sculpture, images and referential systems intermingle and merge into opulent environments inhabited by the artist’s gestures. From occult fables and objective sciences; the Caribbean to European literary traditions, she sails amongst her imaginary composites as much as the techniques that come to give them life: molding, baking, printing, suspension, collage, torsion, extraction. The interest of the artist lies in process, often left visible in her experimental installations. As if lost in a permanent gestation, the work cannot reach a definitive status, in its arrangement, form or reproducibility.

Gaëlle Choisne,"The average human has approximately 2 squared meters of skin. Deployed in space, suspended by small gold-plated chains, this skin is a recording tissue, a sensitive surface. The work is a result of a series of experiments with silicone and surfaces on which the artist transfers images.

Mohamed Bourouissa,"After seeing Martha Camarillo’s photographs of horsemen in Strawberry Mansion -an impoverished Philadelphia neighbourhood- Mohamed Bourouissa travelled to see the urban stables run by African American men. For eight months, he observed, drew and photographed this community. As the community and Bourouissa became closer throughout his stay, the artist suggested that they organize a competition, called “Horse Day”, in which artists from other neighborhoods would be invited to create costumes for the horses. The project then entitled “Urban Riders” revolves around the double projection of the film Horse Day and Distortion, a series of customised saddles, sculptures, photographs and drawings. Using the language of Western iconography, Bourouissa portrays the riders as Black cowboys and urban heroes.","Mohamed Bourouissa studied at the Arts Décoratifs in Paris and then at the Fresnoy.

Mohamed Bourouissa,"In his photographic series Périphérique (2005–2008), Mohamed Bourouissa used the composition of classical paintings to stage the portrait of friends and young people in the banlieues (suburbs). He states “by deconstructing the clichés surrounding this subject, I deal with the problematic power struggle and its mechanics.” This series follows various themes explored throughout the work of Bourouissa. ForTemps Morts, his first film, he depicted a yearlong series of mobile phone exchanges with someone in prison. Bourouissa made a contract with the participant – phone credit in exchange of his participation in the project. Since this piece, he has consistently mediated on notions of exchange and the economy in his work. For L’Utopie d’August Sander, he met a number of unemployed people in a job center and invited them to get scanned in a van.

Gregory Crewdson,"Forest Gathering N.2 is part of the series of photographs Beneath the Roses (2003-2005) where anonymous townscapes, forest clearings and broad, desolate streets are revealed as sites of mystery and wonder; similarly, ostensibly banal interiors become the staging grounds for strange human scenarios. These scenes are tangibly atmospheric, visually alluring and often deeply disquieting. Never anchored precisely in time or place, these and the other narratives of Beneath the Roses are rather located in the dystopic landscape of the anxious American imagination. Crewdson’s process and approach are patently cinematic. This series took shape over the course of three years in collaboration with a full production team.  His projects are made both on studio soundstages and on location in various small towns. After the photograph is taken, Crewdson continues his obsessive process in post-production, using state-of-the-art digital compositing and special effects. And in the end – like film at its best – Crewdson’s fictions, elaborately staged and plotted though they may be, convey an experience that is intensely real.","Gregory Crewdson works within a photographic tradition that combines the documentary style of William Eggleston and Walker Evans with the dream-like vision of filmmakers such as Stephen Spielberg and David Lynch. Crewdson’s method is equally filmic, building elaborate sets to take pictures of extraordinary detail and narrative portent. When he was ten, Crewdson’s father, a psychoanalyst, took him to see a Diane Arbus exhibition at MoMA, an early aesthetic experience that informed his decision to become a photographer. Crewdson’s everyday scenes with charged, surreal moods hint at the longings and malaise of suburban America. The artist uses “the limitations of a photograph in terms of narrative capacity to have an image that is frozen in time, where there’s no before or after” and has turned that restriction into a unique strength.Gregory Crewdson was born in New York in 1962.

Michael Craig-Martin,,"Michael Craig-Martin studied fine art at Yale University returning to Europe in the mid-1960s and becoming one of the key figures in the first generation of British conceptual artists. He was a professor at Goldsmith’s College from 1974–88 and 1994–2000, where he remained a powerful influence on the emerging British artists. His early work made deliberate reference to the American artists he most admired, such as Donald Judd, Jasper Johns and Robert Morris. Although he was particularly affected by Minimalism and used ordinary household materials in his sculptures, playing against the logic of his sources. In the early 1970s, he exhibited his now seminal piece An Oak Tree, consisting of a glass of water standing on a shelf attached to the gallery wall. In the accompanying text, he asked himself questions to assert that the glass was in fact an oak tree.  Craig-Martin continued working in various forms, always maintaining an elegant restraint and conceptual clarity. During the 1990s the focus of his work shifted decisively to painting, with the same range of boldly outlined motifs and luridly vivid color schemes in unexpected (and at times apparently arbitrary) combinations applied both to works on canvas, and to increasingly complex installations of wall paintings.",Untitled (violet),Europe,[],"['minimalism.n.01', 'delineation.n.02', 'mundane.s.02', 'fork.n.01', 'espresso_maker.n.01', 'violet.n.02']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/michael_craig-martin_-_untitled.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/michael_craig-martin_-_untitled-239x300.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/untitled-violet/,['Cultural/3.593954248366013'],['Cultural'],3.593954248366013,"['Design/1.7777777777777777', 'Arts/0.9411764705882353', 'Media/0.875']","['Design', 'Arts', 'Media']",3.593954248366013,[],[],0.0,[],[],0.0,,
Maria Bussman,"The drawing “Heidegger’s Cabin” (2005) is inspired by Martin Heidegger’s essay, “The Origin of the Work of Art.” During the artist’s stay in a high alpine area, near a lake reservoir, Bussmann related the landscape in her surroundings to her reading of Heidegger’s terms on the work of art and the meaning of a “thing.” In attempt to link spiritual heights to natural heights, Bussmann metaphorically relates the subjects of being and truth to a hiking path, and its different degrees of challenge and risk. In the drawings rather than finding the optimal path to reach ultimate meaning and materialization, Bussmann never arrives at “Heidegger’s Cabin,” and instead is led off the beaten track to areas she never discovered before. Upon her return from the mountains in 2004 and 2005, she continued to develop the series, leading up to 20 drawings on handmade paper that attempt to problematize Heidegger’s theory on artworks as “things” as bearers of traits, “things” confronting the world of perception, and “things” as formed matter.","Maria Bussmann’s works represent an insistent attempt to fathom the epistemological quality of her medium, drawing. For the artist, drawing is the most direct form of artistic expression, both as a medium of analysis and of communication.  Her work traditionally grows out of her relationship to reading and the generative force of philosophy and literature, as well as personal references such as temporary sites of residence. Authors that have inspired her work include philosophers Heidegger, Merleau-Ponty, Wittgenstein and Apuleius. Her drawings, at times exhibited as scrolls, exist as open-ended commentaries and annotations to philosophical thinking rather than illustrations of readings or experiences. While reading and thinking, the artist transfers visual ideas that develop in her mind into a two-dimensional space making the drawing expansive. In a transformational process, individual pictorial elements appear like encoded emblems, resulting in a rich textual interwoven fabric. The result is a bulk of sketches made into series around her interpretations of philosophical strands or subjects of reference.  Maria Bussmann was born in 1966 in Würzburg (Germany). Having studied at the Academies of Fine Art in Nuremberg and Vienna, she graduated in philosophy and cultural studies from Vienna University.

Olaf Breuning,"For this image, Olaf Breuning invented a revised stone age corrected for the cinema in which dolmens and leather were replaced by surf boards and neoprene clothing. With the beach as a backdrop, the hyper-aestheticized vikings seem to pose for a surf ad. The collage on the horizon line, the heterogenous nature of the lighting and the costume-like clothing all point to the mise en scène. The artist stated: “I am trying to invent a primitive tribe”. His positioning in relation to stereotype is dual: he exposes them by exaggerating them and displaces them by absorbing them within the iconography of his work.","Olaf Breuning’s photographs, videos, performances and installations play with codes of mass production with references to publicity, fashion and cinema and “high” and “low” art. Between fiction and reality, fairytales and triviality, nightmare and bad jokes, the artist immerses his viewers decidedly into a pop and kitsch culture which is constantly being revisited. His works, made up by quotations, collages, and sampling are highly built. Often hyper-aestheticized, they work as “script-machines” reminiscent of special effects from the film industry.

Her recent work has been concerned with revisiting the country of her childhood and engaging with the experience of exile, political and social destruction, and deprivation. This photograph, which belongs to the series “Love”, was shot by Bhimji during her journey in Uganda in 2001, but was only edited in 2006. It depicts Entebbe airport, the site of evacuation of Asian refugees as well as the site of a daring attempt to resolve a hijacking crisis by Israeli forces in 1976. Although still functioning, principally for private aircraft, it is dilapidated. Commercial flights use a more modern airport, as though Entebbe airport is too scarred by history to be reused. The contrast between the private aircraft and the destitute building is striking. The work evokes a bygone era as well as the consequences of enforced action. The play of light and shadow is emphatic, the dark interior, with its lattice window frames, evoking prison conditions in contrast to the verdant open landscape. The title of the work refers to Bhimji’s father and his decision to leave Uganda, thus closing a chapter of the family history. By returning to Uganda, Bhimji has reopened it.","Zarina Bhimji’s films and photographs result from prolonged research in the field. Over the past few years she has traveled to Zanzibar, India and East Africa (including Uganda where she was born), retracing the path of the former British colonists. However the artworks produced from her enquiries are not in the documentary genre: she is interested in evoking human presence in places where it is absent, but where an atmospheric tension resulting from previous tragic events is still felt.Notwithstanding the manifestation of an acute political awareness in her work, Zarina Bhimji does not neglect the visual aspect: architecture is put to good use in her meticulous compositions, walls being a recurring motif of her visual vocabulary. Her landscapes are sometimes close to abstraction, yet one can feel in them the power of past violence. The beauty and poetry emerging from the images evince a feeling of wonder mixed with a profound melancholy, in the romantic tradition.Zarina Bhimji was born in Mbarara, Uganda in 1963.

ATLAS GROUP / Walid Raad,"It is a little known fact that Lebanese historians were also gamblers during the war. They met every Sunday at the race courses. Race after race, the historians were positioned behind the press photographers who were there to take a picture of the winning horse passing the finishing line. The historians betted on how many fractions of seconds before or after passing the line the photograph would be taken. That is to say that no photo showed the horse on the finishing line. Each page of the notebook contains an image of the horse passing the finish line cut out of the Annahar newspaper on the following day. It features the annotations of doctor Fakhouri on the length and duration of the race, on the winning horse and his timing, his average speed, the initials of the different historians and their bets, the time between the snapshot and the passage of the finishing line, a very brief description of the winning historian (here the linguist). These documents provoke questions about historical fact. Why are there no images of the precise moment when the horse passes the finishing line? Does the press authorize the reproduction of false information?  Conscious of the impossibility of capturing the exact moment, the historians bet not on the horses but on the photographer’s margin of error. The evidence about an event is not necessarily linked to the production of an objective document. There can be no certain objectivity with photographic material.","The Atlas Group is a project established in Beirut in 1999 to research and document the contemporary history of Lebanon.

David Haxton,"In the mid to late 70s David Haxton turned to photography, and similarly to his output in film, his photographs show reverberations of his perspective as a painter. As inferred from the title—and the titles of most of his work—Haxton has a methodical, near-scientific approach to studying and documenting the effects of light. In Holes in White and Holes in Cream with? Front Light on Left, two large perforated sheets of paper hung side by side and a single spotlight are the subject of his scrutiny. The symmetry of the composition here is broken: by the light emanating from the spotlight on the left, and by difference between the white and cream tones of the sheets, which is made starker by the position of the spotlight.  Akin to his single screen-films, Haxton wanted to produce photographs that somehow referred to themselves and their own fundamental nature, which is what led him to solely use photographic backdrop paper and light as his subject. As part of his process he would often begin by taking a Polaroid of the cut paper constructions to study the effect of light in the composition, and would later photograph in larger format negatives.","Although trained as a painter, David Haxton is known for his exploration of light through the mediums of photography and film. Early in his career, in the 1960s and 1970s, he began making installations where he would recreate spaces inside the gallery, and it was through the inclusion of film in these early pieces that he became interested in film’s potential to manipulate space. Examples include the installation Four Screen Films, where he reconstructed his studio in San Diego as projections onto large freestanding screen, as well as an unrealized proposal asking to reconstruct the interior of the Sidney Janis Gallery within the Leo Castelli Gallery simultaneously with an exhibition by Robert Morris.        Over the following decades, his focus geared towards film and he began exploring the elements that he considered essential to the medium such as light, the illusion of space, and the reality of the space where the film is projected. Consequently, he created several single-screen films that use light as an effect to both highlight the medium’s two-dimensional nature, and bring forth its abstract and painterly qualities.        Later, he began using photography to investigate similar concerns, and as with the films, his approach to photography remained consistent for decades.

As the described by Haxton, “[he] became interested in in examining the nature of the medium [of film] including light, movement, and the formation of a three-dimensional illusion of space in a flat surface.”  This selection of films were produced in 16mm film between 1970 and 1982 and have been digitally mastered in high definition from the original 16mm films, which are preserved by the Academy Film Archive in Los Angeles.  Reminiscent of the paired back, low-fi quality of other conceptual video work from that period, Haxton abides to a certain criteria to restrict aspects of the medium: he does not do any editing, always fixes the camera onto a single position for the whole duration of the films, and he limits the actions of the performers.  In films such as Pyramid drawings, Cube and Room Drawings, Cube, and Cylinder Sphere and Solid, Haxton, or sometimes other performers, come into the frame to enact simple movements like drawing shapes in the floor, picking up and pushing strings or pulling down a plastic curtain. Many of these videos include geometrical forms as away to study and undo three-dimensional space and flatten the medium.  In another piece, Bringing Lights Forward, the film is presented in negative and hence what initially appears to be spray-painted dots, is eventually revealed as lights being turned on and off as someone gradually moves them closer to the camera. In various ways, these films reflect his methodical approach to the study of light, its effect in our perception of space, and the very essence of film.  1. Bringing Lights Forward  2.

Drawing Houses","Although trained as a painter, David Haxton is known for his exploration of light through the mediums of photography and film. Early in his career, in the 1960s and 1970s, he began making installations where he would recreate spaces inside the gallery, and it was through the inclusion of film in these early pieces that he became interested in film’s potential to manipulate space. Examples include the installation Four Screen Films, where he reconstructed his studio in San Diego as projections onto large freestanding screen, as well as an unrealized proposal asking to reconstruct the interior of the Sidney Janis Gallery within the Leo Castelli Gallery simultaneously with an exhibition by Robert Morris.        Over the following decades, his focus geared towards film and he began exploring the elements that he considered essential to the medium such as light, the illusion of space, and the reality of the space where the film is projected. Consequently, he created several single-screen films that use light as an effect to both highlight the medium’s two-dimensional nature, and bring forth its abstract and painterly qualities.        Later, he began using photography to investigate similar concerns, and as with the films, his approach to photography remained consistent for decades. Several of his bodies of work consist of photographs of spot lit, large sheets of perforated paper casting shadows in the spaces in which they are hung.  In the compositions Haxton uses the spotlights to ‘paint’ with light, emphasizing the importance of their position in defining our perception of the materials and space.",Collection of 16 Films,Americas,"['light.n.01', 'white.n.01', 'movie.n.01', 'drawing.n.01', 'conceptual.s.01', 'black.n.01', 'medium.n.01', 'motion.n.03', 'camera.n.01', 'space.n.01', 'video.n.01', 'illusion.n.01', 'plastic.n.01', 'analyze.v.01', 'los_angeles.n.01', 'airplane.n.01', 'dark.n.01', 'hole.n.01', 'uncover.v.01', 'percept.n.01', 'survey.n.01', 'installation.n.01', 'position.n.01', 'aspect.n.01', 'floor.n.01']","['conceptual.s.01', 'movie.n.01', 'materiality.n.02', 'material.n.01', 'light.n.01', 'photography.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Bringing-Lights-Forwardx.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Bringing-Lights-Forwardx-300x221.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/collection-of-16-films/,"['Cultural/7.932289055973266', 'Material_Physical/4.632167832167832', 'Individual_Personal/2.6']","['Cultural', 'Material_Physical', 'Individual_Personal']",15.164456888141098,"['Arts/4.604511278195488', 'Media/3.327777777777778', 'Materiality/1.9090909090909092']","['Arts', 'Media', 'Materiality']",9.841379965064174,"['Cultural/25.58204948646126', 'Material_Physical/17.59565467212526', 'Individual_Personal/10.240048840048841']","['Cultural', 'Material_Physical', 'Individual_Personal']",53.417752998635365,"['Media/11.100644616821087', 'Arts/6.216849816849816', 'Mind/4.195604395604396']","['Media', 'Arts', 'Mind']",21.513098829275297,1.0,0.6666666666666666
Nicolás Consuegra,"Consuegra’s Colombia is a mirror made in the shape of the artist’s home country—a silhouette that has an important resonance for the artist. Consuegra’s mirrored Colombia is similar to an earlier version, made to be show opposite a mirror of the United States. Whether reflecting his two homes within one another (Consuegra studied in the US and has made several works about this experience of living in exile from his homeland), or simply reflecting its surroundings, Colombia is a simple yet evocative work about the identity of a nation, and the things that we project—really and metaphorically—onto its form.  Nicolás Consuegra explores the contradictions of modern visual culture through his photographs, sculptures, paintings, and installations. Much of his work deals with subtle differences between one thing and another, whether they are visual differences or semiotic shifts. He creates visual games specifically intended to engage with Modernism’s crisply defined aesthetics. Consuegra’s shrewd alterations expose the superficiality of our shared understanding of the mid-twentieth century, calling into question our perception of reality and temporality.","Nicolás Consuegra (b. 1976, lives in Bogotá) explores the contradictions of modern visual culture through his photographs, sculptures, paintings, and installations.

Rodrigo Torres,"In his Conceito abstrato series, however, Rodrigo Torres turns to the abstract, using the shapes, numbers, lines, and subtle colors of international currencies to create non-representational forms with lavish geometries and baroque curving forms.","Brazilian artist Rodrigo Torres has been deconstructing international paper currencies to form intricate collages of color, line, shape, and texture for several years.

Jorge de León,"Jorge de León most well-known work was a radical gesture, and one of his earliest artworks: in his 2000 performance, The Circle, de León sewed his own mouth closed as a protest against the silencing of citizens in the face of social corruption. His Cristal series is more demure, but follows a similar theme. In these works, delicate, web-like lines emerge against dark backgrounds, creating orbs of negative space, pitch black. These images are alluring, almost serene, but the reality of them breaks that sense: each of these circular shatters trace out the lines of a bullet hole, shot through glass.  Jorge de León is a Guatemalan artist whose work and life represents an interesting evolution. Growing up amongst familial turmoil and violence in the country’s urban core, de León has lived as a bridge between two worlds—the art world, on the one hand, and the street culture of Guatemala City, on the other. While much has been said about the artist’s own checkered history (de León has been in and out of jail throughout his life), much of the art that he makes is positioned against the gang- and drug-fueled violence of his home city and country, rather than as a glorification of it.",,Cristal series,Americas,"['line.n.01', 'violence.n.01', 'state.n.04', 'city.n.01', 'protest.n.01', 'glass.n.01', 'hole.n.01', 'life.n.01', 'background.n.01', 'shooting.n.01', 'gesture.n.01', 'urban.a.01', 'hand.n.01', 'artwork.n.01', 'street.n.01', 'sense.n.01', 'black.a.01', 'subject.n.01', 'performance.n.01', 'world.n.03', 'culture.n.01', 'social.a.01', 'history.n.01', 'space.n.01', 'series.n.01']","['violence.n.01', 'drug.n.01', 'corruptness.n.02', 'guatemala.n.01', 'death.n.01', 'gun.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_01-web.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_01-web-237x300.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/cristal-series/,"['Material_Physical/4.9765182186234815', 'Society/4.545687748783724', 'Politics/4.341176470588235']","['Material_Physical', 'Society', 'Politics']",13.86338243799544,"['Land/2.484210526315789', 'Violence/1.9411764705882353', 'War/1.7473684210526317']","['Land', 'Violence', 'War']",6.172755417956656,"['Society/13.705645644345337', 'Material_Physical/12.790856692327282', 'Politics/9.418790849673202']","['Society', 'Material_Physical', 'Politics']",35.91529318634582,"['Urbanization/5.546606334841629', 'Land/5.22483660130719', 'Activism/4.439705882352941']","['Urbanization', 'Land', 'Activism']",15.21114881850176,1.0,0.3333333333333333

Yung Jake,"I don’t remember is a video by Yung Jake that combines his passion for both music and the visual arts. As per several of his works the video borrows from the vernacular of rap and relies on the aesthetic and stylistic qualities of music videos. A humorous interpretation of the rap and hip hop genres, the video combines scenes from urban settings and snapshots of a party as the artist raps in a drowsy monotone about having forgotten the wild night.  The video is presented through a monitor embedded inside of a powder coated steel frame with visible headphones and an extension cord. This relates to a larger body of works by the artist were he presents video combined with colorful hardware (pink and/or yellow cables, headphones, and metal frames) chosen for its formal and sculptural qualities.","Yung Jake is a visual artist and YouTube rapper based in Los Angeles whose work fuses new media, music, and art. Deeply rooted in a millennial zero, his practice incorporates the vernaculars of social media, internet and rap culture, and combines them through a playful use—or misuse—of digital technology.  Yung Jake came to prominence after releasing the music video Datamosh in 2011, a work where the artist deliberately applied glitches and pixelation to give the footage a hallucinogenic, dream-like effect. A year later he released the video E.m-bed.de/d, which somehow takes over the viewer’s browser to deliver a music video through an elaborate sequence of transitions between pop-ups that open, close, expand and flicker.  Although several of his works are developed entirely for the internet, some pieces by Yung Jake are sculptural or designed to hang on a wall. In a recent series of sculptures, the artist combines prints of popular video-game and cartoon characters with scrap metal, spray paint, stickers, tape, ink, monitors and handwritten text.

Charlotte Moth,"Charlotte Moth asked the art critic Francesco Pedraglio to write a text in response to the Man Ray film “Les Mystères du Château de Dé”, the decor of which was the Villa Noailles, built by Mallet-Stevens. Pedraglio’s text was then displaced since the artist attributed it to her own photographs taken on the rue Mallet-Stevens in Paris. A percussionist gave a audio response to the film during the opening at the Halle fu?r Kunst in  Lüneburg, in 2010. His reaction was then edited into the film. Thus the artist articulated several subjectivities to which we add our own. Light is a major protagonist in her work. Photography is envisaged from an uncertain point of view in terms of its usage, like live matter, formless, malleable and modular. With no title or date, the images express chance and thrilling juxtapositions. Although the darkroom remains the photographer’s tool, Charlotte Moth deals with the image as a sculptor. Through the image, architecture, citation and decor become dematerialized or materialized sculpture.","Charlotte Moth has been constituting an image bank since 1999. She photographs and develops black and white photographs taken in places she passes through around the world. With the eye of a sculptor, she records Modernist architecture in Brazil, Bauhaus style in Germany, empty spaces, out of time. Thus she creates a classification of different types of spaces (different species). This Travelogue, as she calls it, is an organic process, a collage, an activity revealing connections between image and experience. Entirely black and white and with great economy (identical formats, modest sizes), the images convey an obsession with line, order, construction and emptiness. Charlotte Moth doesn’t only have a nostalgic gaze on these spaces since she also proposes multiple readings. Acting as assembler, collector and archivist, she introduces a distanced point of view on her own work. With a Post-Conceptual approach, the artist proposes an in-depth and ambitious conception of the nature of the image and its authority.Charlotte Moth was born in Carshalton (UK) in 1978, and has been living in Paris since 2007.",The Absent Forms,Europe,"['movie.n.01', 'opportunity.n.01', 'matter.n.01', 'supporter.n.01', 'image.n.01', 'tool.n.01', 'photographer.n.01', 'paris.n.01', 'write.v.01', 'architecture.n.01', 'photography.n.01', 'construct.v.01', 'light.n.01', 'position.n.03', 'title.n.01', 'sculpture.n.01', 'photograph.n.01']","['subjectivity.n.01', 'light.n.07', 'collection.n.01', 'uncertainty.n.01', 'authorship.n.02', 'travelogue.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/img-746-1.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/img-746-1-300x191.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/the-absent-forms/,"['Material_Physical/4.8619047619047615', 'Individual_Personal/3.488888888888889', 'Cultural/2.488888888888889']","['Material_Physical', 'Individual_Personal', 'Cultural']",10.83968253968254,"['Materiality/1.6333333333333333', 'Arts/1.6', 'Mind/1.0']","['Materiality', 'Arts', 'Mind']",4.233333333333333,"['Cultural/27.854021082117068', 'Individual_Personal/5.568986568986569', 'Material_Physical/5.03052503052503']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Material_Physical']",38.45353268162867,"['Arts/13.921014546169348', 'Media/5.984188034188034', 'Culture/3.8547008547008548']","['Arts', 'Media', 'Culture']",23.759903435058238,1.0,0.3333333333333333
Douglas Gordon,"In Monster (1996-97), the artist’s face becomes grotesque through the application of strips of transparent adhesive tape, typical of Gordon’s performance-based films that often depict his own body in action. Also characteristic of his work, the scene takes place in front of a mirror, suggesting the kind of personal self-reflection that one is capable of – both good and evil. The video makes clear cinematographic reference to the ‘alter-ego’ transformation in Mamoulian’s Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, and to the “You looking at me?” sequence performed in front of a mirror by Robert De Niro in Scorsese’s Taxi Driver which also inspired Gordon’s through a looking glass (1999).","Douglas Gordon is a celebrated Scottish artist whose work revolves around the themes of memory, time and our perception of it. Spanning across film, video, installation, photography, and sculpture, his work offers a new experience of the cinematic in the space of contemporary art, creating what critic Dominique Païni described as ‘exhibition cinema.’   Interested in how we experience temporality, Gordon has often slowed down either original or appropriated footage in order to play with the viewers’ perception. An example is his celebrated work 24 Hour Psycho (1993), in which Gordon stretched the duration of Alfred Hitchcock’s iconic movie to last 24 hours. This gesture both monumentalized time and intensified the imagery, structurally reframing the film by shifting our perception away from the movie’s original narrative and directing it towards the finer details that constitute every single frame.  Several of his works incorporate that universal dichotomies: of life and death, innocence and guilt, and dual identities. Harboring the tension between opposing forces, Gordon then employs formal strategies of repetition, mirroring, and doubling to construct a deliberate ambiguity and multiplicity of meaning.",The Making of Monster,Europe,"['mirror.n.01', 'transformation.n.01', 'perform.v.01', 'glass.n.01', 'feature.n.01', 'sequence.n.01', 'personal.a.01', 'action.n.01', 'mention.n.01', 'scene.n.01', 'body.n.01', 'movie.n.01', 'video.n.01']","['grotesque.n.01', 'body.n.01', 'disguise.n.01', 'monster.n.01', 'self.n.01', 'mirror.v.01', 'dichotomy.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/img-434.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/img-434-300x190.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/making-of-monster/,"['Material_Physical/11.105805615093542', 'Cultural/8.37875816993464', 'Individual_Personal/5.202614379084967']","['Material_Physical', 'Cultural', 'Individual_Personal']",24.68717816411315,"['Space/7.1882591093117405', 'Arts/4.27892156862745', 'Mind/2.6470588235294117']","['Space', 'Arts', 'Mind']",14.114239501468601,"['Cultural/16.278133304603898', 'Material_Physical/14.598168498168503', 'Society/10.307448107448108']","['Cultural', 'Material_Physical', 'Society']",41.18374991022051,"['Space/7.203296703296703', 'Technology/4.813725490196078', 'Media/4.0970085470085476']","['Space', 'Technology', 'Media']",16.114030740501327,0.6666666666666666,0.3333333333333333
Douglas Gordon,"Blind Spencer is part of the series “Blind Stars” including hundreds of works in which the artist cut out the eyes of Hollywood stars, in a symbolically violent manner. An emptiness (some are burned letting appear a white or mirror background or a mirror) replaces the eyes, giving the impression of a blind eye deprived of all expression. Paradoxically, the work looks at us all the more intensely. The glamorous black and white portrait of Spencer Tracy evokes the golden age of Hollywood, with all of its codes like seductive smiles and directional light, not to mention a perverse use of the gaze.  Gordon talks about his work as a process of “research, memory, of stories that took place, the films I’ve seen … I am interested in looking for what happens when you look at something so long that it disappears. You are viewing an image, you start looking through the image, and you reach the other side and then you return to the surface. ” This act of cutting, pertinent to a new generation of artists focusing on the ready-made, image fragments and found sound footage, juxtaposes temporalities like in video editing and introduces a hint of melancholy. The act of cutting fascinates and repels, in what Freud called an experience of “the uncanny.” The viewer can only contemplate a loss of the soul which is traditionally reflected in the eyes. After Andy Warhol and his celebrity portraits, Douglas Gordon tracks the iconic and deadly character of his subjects.","Douglas Gordon is a celebrated Scottish artist whose work revolves around the themes of memory, time and our perception of it.

Tacita Dean,"The photographic quality of the film Baobab is not only the result of a highly sophisticated use of black and white and light, but also of the way in which each tree is characterized as an individual, creating in the end a series of portraits. The monumental and unnatural aspect of the baobabs turns them into strange and anthropomorphic personalities. Adding to the descriptive aspect of the film, the sound is a recording of the environment, of sounds made by animals, and participates in this peaceful contemplation. The still, almost fossilized aspect of the landscape makes it look majestic and eternal.  « The camera, which examines in Baobab the ancestral and imposing trees of Madagascar, tries to capture the shadow and light effects, specific to photography. »  (Essay by Julia Garimorth, in « Tacita Dean: Seven Books », published by Steidl / ARC/ Musée d’Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris, 2003).","Although Tacita Dean works with all kinds of media, her 16mm films are probably among her most well-known works. While they deal with the specificities of the medium – like the notions of time and narrative, through the use of still shots – the aesthetic quality of her films remind of photography or painting (maybe because she had studied painting in school). Memories and atmospheres are conveyed through sensual images, colors and light. In her work, Tacita Dean relates the past to the present, often creating a certain melancholy: the artist focuses on stories, characters or architectural relics, and questions the notion of narrative by using both documentary and fiction devices.Tacita Dean was born in Canterbury, UK, in 1965.

Joachim Koester,"Tarantism is the name of disease which appeared in southern Italy, resulting from the bite of a spider called Tarantula. This bite caused various symptoms, such as nausea, difficulty to speak, delusion, excitability and agitation. The victims suffered then from convulsions and the only way to heal them was to engage in a frenzied dance, as it was believed.  Called “Tarantella”, this dance, appeared during the Middle Ages and was danced all along the 19th century.  To make this video, the artist asked a group of dancers to perform this uncontrolled dance in order to explore this borderline mental and physical state, close to a trance. Tarantism represents a transition in the artist’s work, who brings a story back to life simply through the movement of these completely disarticulate bodies, without referring to images extracted from reality, thus exploring a purely mental territory.","With a keen interest in the stranger corners of the long human story, and a persistent interest in the supernatural, the transcendent, and the psychedelic, Joachim Koester’s work follows the artists own undying interest in physical and psychological limits. While exploration was  a matter of crossing geographies before the 19th century, the 20th century brought the mental exploration of our unconscious, hastened by the discovery of psychoanalysis. Koester is interested in visualizing specific events—those forgotten, overlooked, or suppressed by the official historical record—in order to reintroduce them into collective memory. Using 16mm documentary films, photographic series or books, his work transforms stories into images and vice versa, appearing as a quest for the invisible and the vanishing.",Tarantism,Europe,"['dance.n.01', 'name.v.01', 'perform.v.01', 'district.n.01', 'age.n.01', 'research.v.02', 'passage.n.01', 'boundary_line.n.01', 'physical.a.01', 'century.n.01', 'center.n.01', 'motion.n.03', 'world.n.03', 'body.n.01', 'narrative.n.01', 'life.n.01', 'video.n.01', 'image.n.01']","['unconscious_mind.n.01', 'release.n.09', 'tarantella.n.02', 'dance.n.01', 'psychological_state.n.01', 'bodied.s.02']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/img-277.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/img-277-300x200.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/tarantism/,"['Cultural/14.915118868060047', 'Individual_Personal/11.80719280719281', 'Society/9.815209428252908']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Society']",36.53752110350576,"['Arts/7.661064425770307', 'Mind/5.013419913419913', 'Power/4.126373626373627']","['Arts', 'Mind', 'Power']",16.800857965563846,"['Material_Physical/32.76224639653432', 'Society/19.84963955892749', 'Individual_Personal/17.505946994182292']","['Material_Physical', 'Society', 'Individual_Personal']",70.11783294964411,"['Land/10.628413416648712', 'Urbanization/10.14871794871795', 'Body/7.973712561947855']","['Land', 'Urbanization', 'Body']",28.75084392731452,0.6666666666666666,0.0
Matthew Darbyshire,"In Kan’s four-channel video Island, a series of objects like nail clippers, hairbrush, toothpaste, and house decorations are shot in close-up. These highly polished and aestheticized images, create a poetic visual flow. However, in front of each object lies a coin of different value—two yuan, one pound, one euro, one dollar—that silently reveals the material value of the household supplies. Underneath the video’s elegant surface there is a deep sense of critical irony, elaborated in the contradictory nature of the cheap plastic items and their sophistic visual interpretation. Kan poignantly and metaphorically comments on the economic and production at the base of today’s global market and shows that extremely influential visual spectacles can be generated by the most everyday of items.","Matthew Darbyshire is interested in the non-specificity of today’s design language. Parodying corporate branding and mass-produced design, Darbyshire’s installations expose the hollow realities behind urban regeneration and government arts investment in social regenerative projects. At the centre of Darbyshire’s work is the observation that certain core human concerns – among them the look and feel of the built environment, the intersection of art and the social realm, the idea of community and eve the possibility  of visual pleasure – are, very often, framed in ways that are reductive, philosophically empty and serve only to further the interests of embedded power. Unusually for an artist who belongs to a generation that regularly revisits episodes form the (usually Modernist) past, Darbyshire’s focus is on what he calls the ‘mush and fug’ of contemporary Britain’s visual environment, something that in a high-wire act of chromatic and formal management he sequences into works that, while they speak eloquently of the quasyhomogeneity of much present day architecture and design, also have a resonant sculptural presence.*Matthew Darbyshire was born in Cambridge, UK, in 1977.

Tino Sehgal,"Tino Sehgal’s This Exhibition requires an interpreter (in this particular piece, a gallery attendant) to faux faint each and every time a visitor enters into a given space. Upon hitting the cold, hard  gallery floor, the seemingly confused interpreter writhes slowly on the ground while reciting a few lines from the curatorial statement in a whispered moan.","Tino Sehgal  has developed a radical artistic practice that takes the form of live encounters between people. He describes his works as ‘constructed situations’, whose materials are the human voice, language, movement, and interaction, without the production of physical objects. What all of Sehgal’s works have in common is that they remain only in the space and time they occupy, and in the memory of the work and its reception. Despite its immaterial character, the artist’s work fulfills the conventions of visual art and functions fully within the infrastructure of the art gallery or museum. The work is present during the entire duration of an exhibition, it enters public and private collections and exists over time by being repeated.  As he stated in an interview with Tim Griffin for Artforum: “The reason I’m interested in the transformation of actions. . . is because I think that the appearance of both an excess supply of basic material goods and of mankind’s endangering of the specific disposition of “nature” in which human life seems possible renders the hegemony of the dominant mode of production questionable. Obviously, this doesn’t mean to propose an essentialist “No” to material objects in general but rather leads to the question as to how we could produce things that, on the one hand, aren’t problematic and, on the other, are more interesting or complex, or less static.”Artforum, May 2005, p. 218-219  Tino Sehgal was born in London in 1976.

Guy Ben-Ner,"Wild Boy  is the story of the education of Amir, the artist’s son. Ben-Ner plays the educator’s part, trying to domesticate the child. Using the metaphor of the wild child is Ben-Ner’s homage to this recurring theme in literature and cinema: from Edgar Rice Burroughs’ « Tarzan » to Truffaut’s « L’enfant sauvage », and Rudyard Kipling’s « Jungle book ». The video is an attempt at capturing this decisive moment when the child lets go of its wilderness to become « civilized », and raises the nature/culture dichotomy, dear to the Enlightenment philosophers.","In his films, Guy Ben-Ner plays with the history of cinema, referring to the experimental origins of silent film, to comic figures such as Keaton and Chaplin, and to Truffaut’s French New Wave. Since 1996, the artist has been concentrating on his family members and stages them with burlesque humor. Just as Buster Keaton, he is at once actor-director, his wife and children the only other actors, and his apartment the improvised set: he uses available furniture and objects, creates an artificial island in his kitchen and constructs a tree house for Treehouse Kit (2005), a work in which the sculpture takes part in the video installation. The theatrical aspect of the set relates to the playful situations. Each one of Ben-Ner’s films participates, as an episode, to a collection of fables about human nature, reenacting stereotypical motifs found in literature and cinema, such as the desert island (“Berkeleys Island” 1999) or “Moby Dick” (2000).

Saâdane Afif,"Blue time is a song co-written by artists Saâdane Afif and Lili Reynaud Dewar. Collaborations are frequent in the work of the Afif, as is the case of the exhibition  “Lyrics” which opened at the Palais de Tokyo in 2005, in which Saâdane Afif asked artists and musicians to translate his artworks into song lyrics and interpret them. The lyrics written on the wall produced a silent story, in a musical way that remains implicit (unlike certain installations by the artist where lyrics can be heard on headphones). The writing in hologram print displayed on the wall recalls the iridescent surface of CDs. The refrain “I’ve be waitin’…” introduces temporality and musicality in the field of meaning. This song is a commentary on pop music with a meta-poetic dimension. It depicts the life of a songwriter: “I ‘ve been waitin’ for the producers […] I left home when I was a kid […] I’ve been on the road indefinitely […] I played in bars, hotels, parties.” Like in “Actualité” a 16mm film by Matthia Poledna from 2001, Saâdane Afif and Lili Reynaud Dewar paint a nostalgic and idealized portrait of the artist as a pop star.  Saâdane Afif practices the quote: “I belong to a generation of artists who {…} discuss art as a form of language, with which you play upon, you deform, you transform, without focusing on the object as it was before.” Such strategies of","Saâdane Afif practices the quote: “I belong to a generation of artists who {…} discuss art as a form of language, with which you play upon, you deform, you transform, without focusing on the object as it was before.” Such strategies of re-appropriation insert themselves inside a context of idea circulation, as a form of remixing and remaking. In the work “Pirates Who’s Who,” tactics of assemblage are recognizable on all levels. The artist makes use of an eccentric shelf by designer Ron Arad, displaying dripping paint on the wall while the shelf itself holds a collection of books on piracy, compiled together by the owner of the work. “Power chords” (2005), perhaps the most ambitious project by the artist to date, is both a work for publication and several exhibitions. The installation depicts automatic electric guitars, playing scores orchestrated by a computer program. The chords are defined by color sequences derived from André Cadere’s wooden segments. Yet with Afif’s displacement, the artist hints to the color and rhythmic sound dimensions vis-à-vis Cadere, inside a genre of synesthesia. In an age of numerical technology, Cadere’s rhythmic system echoes in a particular manner together with the processes of digitization. Afif suggests a principle of encoding the world underlying the real, or rhythmic language before the Tower of Babel. Saâdane Afif was born in 1970 in Vendome, France.

Joana Hadjithomas & Khalil Joreige,"Rocket Society refers to a space project led by a group of Armenian researchers at the beginning of the 1960s. They created the first Middle Eastern rocket and carried out a dozen launches. Today, there is a kind of amnesia related to this space program while at that time the newspapers would talk about it frequently; a postal stamp was even issued for the occasion. This event does not correspond to the idea one has, when thinking of Lebanese history. In Lebanon, there are only a few pictures and newspaper clippings remaining from this research. However, the initiator of the project lives in Florida and he has saved a great number of archives that the artists used for their project.  This work highlights the process related to omission and concealment but also the way history is written.  Joreige and Hadjithomas reproduce in a real scale the most emblematic eight meter high Cedar 4 rocket. Its transportation out of Lebanon, in order to make photographs of it, required a lot of negotiation with the army and the police. Although, originally these rockets had been designed in a Protestant university conducted by a reverend, as a gesture of peace and guided by a belief in progress, today these objects have become a synonym of war and are interpreted above all as missiles.  The reenactment proposed by Joreige and Hadjithomas does not refer only to the past. It takes place in the present to offer the possibility of a new way of thinking and writing Lebanon’s past and future. At that time it was mainly the project of researchers and dreamers who were fighting against communitarian society and micro-powers. This reenactment of the rocket’s transportation reveals that this scientific project would be unconceivable today. The photographs are real shots and not photomontages, that have been taken in specific places of the city.","Joana Hadjithomas and Khalil Joreige collaborate as both filmmakers and artists, producing cinematic and visual artwork that intertwine, spanning feature and documentary films, video and photographic installations, sculpture, performance lectures and texts. For the last 15 years, they have focused on the images, representations and history of their home country, Lebanon, and questioned the fabrication of imaginaries in the region and beyond. Together, they have directed documentaries such as Khiam 2000-2007 (2008) and El Film el Mafkoud (The Lost Film) (2003) and feature films such as Al Bayt el Zaher (1999) and A Perfect Day (2005). Their most recent feature film, Je Veux Voir (I Want to See), starring Catherine Deneuve and Rabih Mroue, premiered at the Cannes film festival in 2008. Each work is often the result of several years of development, seeing their role as researchers as an integral element of their practice, while equally drawing upon personal, lived experience as a source of inspiration.",Rocket Society.

Antonio Caro,"Juego de Banderas (a play on words that loosely translates to both set of flags and game of flags) is a triptych of modified Colombian flags by Antonio Caro. Although the yellow, blue and red stripes on the first flag are faithful to the original, the second flag at the center has been modified to feature the word Colombia, emulating the typography and white-on-red design of the iconic Coca-Cola brand. Caro’s first version of this logo was a 1976 graphite drawing, and he has since produced several variations in different materials. Equally relevant now as it was in the 70s, the logo juxtaposes the idea of national identity with the process of intrusion of a foreign commercial emblem and problematizes the growing consumerism brought forth by the economic and cultural americanization experienced in Colombia and all across Latin America. A third flag on the right shows a related but different modification: the yellow stripe that symbolizes gold and the country’s riches and wealth has been rendered in black, and the only yellow remaining is used to spell out the word ‘mineria’ (mining). As per several of his works, Juego de Banderas employs symbolic elements in order to instigate a civic dialogue around issues Caro perceives around him.","One of the founders of the Conceptual Art Movement in Colombia, Antonio Caro’s idea-based works are rooted in the social issues of his country. He began showing work in the late 60s in Bogota and subsequently became an important figure in the global artistic scene, developing in over five decades a distinctive, humorous, and highly idiosyncratic visual language with an emphasis on text and other graphic elements. Some of his best known works appropriate and misuse the typography of iconic international advertising brands—such as Coca-Cola and Marlboro—as means to comment of the social and political conditions of his native Colombia and their relationship to the imperialist and capitalist hierarchies of power that now grip their reality. Although he initially gained notoriety as a conceptual artist, over the years his practice has resisted categorizations, easy commercialization—through his choice of materials such as salt, achiote, cardboard and paper scraps—and has consistently questioned the label of ‘political art’ through his distinctive use of sarcasm, wit, and critical sense of humor.",Juego de Banderas,Americas,"['flag.n.01', 'dialogue.n.01', 'national.a.01', 'version.n.01', 'united_states.n.01', 'iconic.a.01', 'design.n.01', 'symbolic.a.01', 'red.s.01', 'game.n.01', 'play.n.01', 'economic.a.01', 'produce.v.01', 'issue.n.01', 'set.n.01', 'original.s.01', 'center.n.01', 'state.n.04', 'elements.n.01', 'identity.n.01', 'idea.n.01', 'black.a.01', 'drawing.n.01', 'cultural.a.01', 'procedure.n.01']","['consumerism.n.01', 'identity.n.02', 'advertising.n.02', 'mining.n.01', 'imperialism.n.03', 'flag.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_AC-16Triptico-Colombia-mineria-WEB.png,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_AC-16Triptico-Colombia-mineria-WEB-300x91.png,https://kadist.org/work/triptico-colombia-mineria/,"['Society/13.840343282448545', 'Material_Physical/3.355790513833992', 'Individual_Personal/3.252777777777778']","['Society', 'Material_Physical', 'Individual_Personal']",20.44891157406032,"['Economy/12.040343282448546', 'Environmental/1.662608695652174', 'Mind/1.6527777777777777']","['Economy', 'Environmental', 'Mind']",15.3557297558785,"['Individual_Personal/38.09981129981131', 'Cultural/34.56641707965238', 'Society/17.032722832722833']","['Individual_Personal', 'Cultural', 'Society']",89.69895121218653,"['Culture/11.621978021978023', 'Mind/9.882051282051282', 'Arts/9.673102061337357']","['Culture', 'Mind', 'Arts']",31.177131365366662,0.6666666666666666,0.3333333333333333
Elisabeth Wild,"Her collage works are made from the pages of glossy lifestyle magazines, from which the artist identifies colors, forms, and textures that she reconstitutes into rich, abstract compositions.

Vivek Vilasini,"In his work Housing Dreams Walls, the houses photographed are from a closely-knit locale in Kerala – a significant and rapidly popular pattern in this part of the country. The pattern of richly colored and aggressively decorated residences symbolizes prosperity and exudes a sense of security – both financial and social. Although the vocabulary of aesthetics can be termed kitsch, the idea is to understand the underlying expression in the ostentatiously and vibrantly decorated households and giving them some sense of individuality, reflecting their owners’ personalities. The colorful walls symbolize wealth, while also reflecting the manner in which the owners would like others to perceive them. On a less visible level, the paint used also happens to be toxic, so it pollutes the ground when rain showers wash the colorful houses.","Born 1964 in Trishur, Kerala, India Lives and works in Bangalore, India  First trained as a Marine radio officer at the All India Marine College in Kochi, Vivek Vilasini obtained a Bachelor’s degree in Political Science from Kerala University in 1987 before turning to art and studying traditional Indian craftspeople’s sculpture. In his work Vilasini examines our existing social structures, adapting various expressions of cultural identity prevalent in society today to raise questions about the continually changing global scenario that every individual struggles to keep pace with. In the photo collage Between One Shore and Several Others (Just what is it… after Richard Hamilton) from 2008, Vilasini referred to Richard Hamilton’s iconic pop collage Just What Is It That Makes Today’s Homes So Different, So Appealing? (1965) by crossing the cultures of the East and the West.

Meschac Gaba,"The headdresses, woven from artificial hair braids, symbolize historical icons including Martin Luther King, Kwame Nkrumah, Fela Kuti and King Guézo of Dahomey. The wigs portraying these grand figures also unambiguously recall Africa to mind. By declaring Cotonou, one of Benin’s cities, the Art Museum of Real Life, and by having thirty white-clad figures wearing Gaba’s latest series of tresses cross through it, he draws attention to the urban space and its inhabitants’ strategies of survival and improvisation. In doing this, he enquires into alternative models, and into the tasks and local interpretations of the museum: “The micro-macro economy represents the survival of the inhabitants of this city day after day (…) In the city of Cotonou, you can see installations everywhere – it is like an open-air museum.” In this series Meschac Gaba weaves symbolic crowns that suggest a historical character, suggested through one of her or his realizations. Here in the case of former Beninese president Hubert Maga, the hairstyle headdress is woven in the form of a hospital that was built during his reign and was named after him. The forms and styles of braided hairstyles range from purely functional to complex and symbolic: hair can be an indicator of age, authority, social status, religion or even supernatural powers. In cities across Europe and the Americas, African hair braiders produce extravagant creations based on their traditional braiding skills and styles, uniting capitalist commerce with traditional culture. In Gaba´s work, two seemingly divergent products of humankind, hair and architecture, meet as equally significant symbols of modern culture. In making this work, Gaba assumes the role of the nouveau tresseur or tresseuse (the new braider), a traditional Beninese hair braider, reassigning meaning to architectural forms and cultural experiences.","born in 1961 in Cotonou, Benin.He lives and works between Cotonou and Rotterdam  Over the past 20 years, through various bodies of works, Beninese artist Meshac Gaba has attempted to reframe contemporary African artistic identity, asking us to shed our preconceived ideas and re-imagine the African continent with a more valid contemporary image. Meschac Gaba emerged onto the international contemporary art scene in 1999 when he presented the Museum of Contemporary African Art in the exhibition “Mirror’s Edge” at Bilmuseet in Umea, Sweden. It marked the beginning of an expansive conceptual and virtual project based on the subjectivity of museum spaces. Twelve installations constitute his imagined Museum of Contemporary African Art (MCAA), originally created in 1997 and shown individually at other international institutions or events since then. Confronted with one’s cultural centrality, the spectator is asked to reconsider his viewpoint of memory and history. Gaba’s complex and varied artistic practice provides an in-depth examination of cultural appropriation, public space, the role of the western museum, and the changing global economy. His appropriation of tourist imagery –from cinema and souvenirs to magazines and museums– allows the viewer to deconstruct the western iconography and disturb modes of representation in contemporary art.",Hubert Maga (perruque MAVA-musée d'art de la vie active),Middle East & Africa,"['hair.n.01', 'traditional.a.01', 'museum.n.01', 'city.n.01', 'day.n.01', 'symbolic.a.01', 'historical.a.01', 'manner.n.01', 'form.n.01', 'figure.n.01', 'culture.n.01', 'world.n.08', 'status.n.01', 'icon.n.01', 'europe.n.01', 'scheme.n.01', 'age.n.01', 'architectural.a.01', 'creation.n.01', 'africa.n.01', 'economy.n.01', 'installation.n.01', 'local.a.01', 'complex.a.01', 'model.n.01']","['architecture.n.02', 'improvisation.n.01', 'hair.n.01', 'cross-cultural.a.01', 'braid.n.01', 'west.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/gaba_copie.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/gaba_copie-225x300.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/untitled-29/,"['Cultural/18.976928936216872', 'Material_Physical/7.132478632478633', 'Society/4.745035666088297']","['Cultural', 'Material_Physical', 'Society']",30.8544432347838,"['Arts/9.257367778420411', 'Technology/4.083333333333333', 'Land/4.038461538461539']","['Arts', 'Technology', 'Land']",17.379162650215285,"['Society/17.743517756753057', 'Cultural/15.153840767076066', 'Individual_Personal/13.08482367305897']","['Society', 'Cultural', 'Individual_Personal']",45.9821821968881,"['Arts/6.0025641025641026', 'Economy/5.05970695970696', 'Time/4.332620320855615']","['Arts', 'Economy', 'Time']",15.394891383126676,0.6666666666666666,0.3333333333333333
Julien Crépieux,"Julien Crépieux is interested in the medium of video and its confrontation with cinema.  Microfilm is a video transcription of a cinematographic work. It isn’t a remake or an adaptation, but a transcription in the musical sense. The structure of the model is respected but the final object differs from the original through the distance taken and its contextualization, a sort of mise en abime of the shooting situation. Samuel Fuller’s film Pick up on South Street (1953) is used like a score for this realization (one could refer to the execution of the work rather like in music).  The work groups a number of the artist’s concerns such as the image and its decomposition, as well as the confrontation of different time frames.  It consists of filming a film rather like pirates would surreptitiously record premieres or unavailable work in cinemas in order to constitute a collection. Yet in this case, it isn’t a sequence shot and the framing doesn’t exclude the context but, on the contrary, integrates it into a new composition. Microfilm revisits each cut, each movement and each angle of the camera, each value of the shots in the “model” film not by arranging actors but on one or several monitors screening Samuel Fuller’s film, set in space in different interiors and exteriors of an uninhabited house. For each sequence, the placement of the screens in the space is determined by the movements that need to be reproduced so that the reference image is always on the screen. Thus there is a synchronization of movement and duration between the image and the image contained in the image.  The artist shot this video alone, with no technical team, so that the quasi intimate link with the model, a very direct bodily rapport, can be sensed on the image. With this display apparatus, Samuel Fuller’s film could equally be the souvenir of a film and could inhabit this depopulated and haunted decor via the off-camera presence of the body filming.",Julien Crépieux was born in 1979.

Haris Epaminonda,"Haris Epaminonda’s work questions the manipulation and the flow of images as well as their power of fascination. The images she works with to create her collages (paper or video) come from magazines or history books, film extracts or soap operas from the 1960s and 1970s.  By readapting a universal past (in her work on monuments) as well as personal (with tv series she used to watch as a child, etc.) Haris Epaminonda questions the creation and the assertion of an identity in a particular cultural context and in a currently divided country.  Created from extracts of kitsch movies or Greek soap operas from the 1960s, these videos are like audiovisual ‘postcards’ reflecting a nostalgic and melancholic approach. The images have lost their context and original meaning to then be re-assembled, confronted to each other and superimposed with other elements, to reveal new sequences. The narration has disappeared from the sequences and the spectator waits in vain for something to happen.  In “Tarahi V”, the saturated colors of the sequences collected from 1960 films seem to give a new life to the characters (the little girl in pink with her doll, the couple walking backwards, etc.) while the fireworks, superimposed throughout the film provide a disenchanting aspect to the whole scene. Recalling Hitchcock as well as René Magritte, “Tarahi V” presents a pending moment providing the shots and the characters with ghostly appearances. This feeling is reinforced by the piano arrangement creating tension throughout the whole sequence.  The lighting, the colors and the particular rhythm of Haris Epaminonda’s films provide a strong radiant power. They are like traces of a fictionalized past permanently stuck in one’s memory. Haris Epaminonda’s films and collages belong to a fragmented art that questions the “in between”, a shifting moment leading to a new spatial and time-related sphere.","Epaminonda’s video works are based on re-shot excerpts of film and television footage – principally the Greek soap operas and kitsch romantic films fromthe 1960s that used to fill up Sunday afternoons in the artist’s Cypriot childhood –which she then subtly reworks. Sometimes local celebrities appear in her films, but, in contrast to the early works of Francesco Vezzoli or T.J. Wilcox, they don’t do so in order to emphasize a phantasmal communion with their constructed identities. The scenes that she chooses to work with are not instantly recognizable from the original narrative, so the culled images are effectively stripped of their initial meaning and context. These out-takes are then edited and adapted in a variety of ways: the film’s speed and direction are changed, sections are distorted, its colour is intensified, or a poignant soundtrack is added. Most significantly, she also superimposes footage to make surreal composites: an indoor scene, say, might also have traces of fireworks glimmering through it. While these are all common manipulation techniques of digital video, Epaminonda uses them with captivating sensibility. Extract by Dominic Eichler (Frieze 111).

Meiro Koizumi,"This video installation was made for the exhibition “Journey to the West” held in January 2012 in New Delhi, where a group of curators invited six Japanese artists to produce a work to be made around the relationship between Japan and India. In the framework of this exhibition, Meiro Koizumi decided to use a controversial book of modern Japanese history The Judgement of Justice Radhabinod Pal, as material for his work. Koizumi created a performance combining the paradoxical context of this book with monstrous representation of Indian gods. The central performer had to read the Judgement of Pal as seriously as possible, while two other performers on the side had to make a comedy out of the situation. It is Koizumi’s attempt to create a new god-like mythical figure that embodies the contradiction inscribed within modern Japanese history and identity. The context of this work has much to do with the trial held in Tokyo right after the war to judge Japanese war criminals. Judge Pal was the only Asian judge to be invited to the trial, and he was the only one that found all the defendants not guilty.","Meiro Koizumi is a Japanese video and performing artist, born in 1976. He has built a compelling body of work that deals with power dynamics on scales from the familial to the national, and examines questions of political and psychological control. Implicating himself, his performers, and the viewer through choreographed emotional manipulations, Koizumi creates works that straddle the uncomfortable and indefinable line between cruelty and comedy.

Otobong Nkanga,"Born in 1974, Kano, Nigeria, Otobong Nkanga lives and works in Antwerp, Belgium.  Nkanga makes use of different mediums like drawing, performance, photography video or installation to put forward observations and sensations of the everyday influences in our social developments, environment and culture. Her works refers to autobiographical narratives and social ecological realities of spaces of her homeland and places she encounters.  Her drawings, installations, photographs, videos and sculptures variously examine ideas around land and the value connected to its resources. In many of her works Nkanga reflects metonymically on the use and cultural value of natural resources, exploring how meaning and function are relative within cultures and revealing different roles and histories for the same products. She edits her own experience and that of her compatriots into purposeful and lucid icons. Mining memory and personal urban biography Nkanga reveals the dialectical relationships between everyday material landscapes and the unseen social, political, and economic structures that shape – and are shaped by – them.  A more documentary approach to the consequent interrogation of the implications of human acts and their effects on varied environments and contexts, one can find in Nkanga’s different photographic series Dolphin Estate. The series documents the first prefabricated residential neighbourhood in Lagos, built in the 1990s. In a statement Nkanga recounts that these photographs, taken in 2008, “show the results and conditions of a long lost dream. Dolphin Estate has gradually fallen into a state of disrepair leaving the residents to take care for their daily needs such as water, electricity and deal with flooding problems”. The neo-American suburbian names for the housing complexes seem to suggest a gated community as a utopia in daily life, but in reality the buildings are often not adequately equipped with the facilities they promise and the necessity emerges to build extensions and additional structures to support human survival as a multitude of giant water vessels outside the apartment windows prove. As the photographs show, the makeshift altération between the domestic environment and the vividly coloured barrels infuses an aspect of beauty into a rather dull, concrete environment.  Therefore, on a meta-level Dolphin Estates seems to tackle the moral questions connected to the aesthetics of non-architecture and the originality that animates parallel urbanity, as a source of inspiration for artists and architects. Again, as in other works, it is a question that revolves around the paradoxes of exploitation.","Visual artist and performer, Otobong Nkanga’s (b. 1974, Kano, Nigeria) practice weaves together concerns about land, natural resources, architecture and the dynamic status of remembrance. Pivotal to this is examining, representing and altering ideas of geographies, home and displacement. Her multimodal works spans performance, installation, sculpture, drawing, textiles, photography and video. Instead of focusing on the differences between distinct objects and environments, Nkanga focuses on their similarities and connections. For Nkanga, the crucial element of connection is memory, stating: “Memory is not only an autobiographical state, but also an important notion in relation to objects that leave traces”.",Dolphin Estate,Middle East & Africa,"['environment.n.01', 'water.n.01', 'daily.s.01', 'social.a.01', 'structure.n.01', 'everyday.s.01', 'construct.v.01', 'world.n.03', 'human.a.01', 'question.n.01', 'culture.n.01', 'photograph.n.01', 'apartment.n.01', 'statement.n.01', 'icon.n.01', 'aesthetics.n.01', 'brush.n.06', 'bear.v.01', 'beauty.n.01', 'dream.n.01', 'documentary.a.01', 'development.n.01', 'installation.n.01', 'effects.n.01', 'land.n.01']","['urbanity.n.02', 'decrepitude.n.01', 'environment.n.01', 'housing.n.01', 'improvised.s.01', 'survival.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/04_dolphin_estate_3.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/04_dolphin_estate_3-224x300.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/dolphin-state/,"['Material_Physical/5.687912087912088', 'Individual_Personal/5.148717948717948', 'Society/2.6263736263736264']","['Material_Physical', 'Individual_Personal', 'Society']",13.463003663003663,"['Materiality/3.1076923076923078', 'Familial/2.6564102564102567', 'Arts/2.3692307692307693']","['Materiality', 'Familial', 'Arts']",8.133333333333335,"['Cultural/28.42942105194428', 'Society/16.841598417062816', 'Material_Physical/12.791014867485455']","['Cultural', 'Society', 'Material_Physical']",58.06203433649256,"['Arts/11.492074738127371', 'Land/5.263736263736264', 'Environmental/4.046886446886447']","['Arts', 'Land', 'Environmental']",20.80269744875008,0.6666666666666666,0.3333333333333333
CAMP,"The Annotated “Gujarat and the Sea” Exhibition is a collateral project within the larger body of work around the Indian Ocean, entitled “Wharfage” (2009-13) which has included over the years a radio event, several books and a film. “Boat Modes” (2009-12) dealt with the modalities of maritime life on ships and in ports between UAE, Southern Iran, India and Somalia, using photographs, texts and film based on mobile phone videos made by sailors.  CAMP sees this work as a kind of historical intervention on the same subject. Their installation is a critique of the exhibition «Gujarat and the Sea» that took place in 2010 in the port town of Mandvi and travelled to Ahmedabad and Surat, in Gujarat, India. The exhibition brought together around 80 high quality digital reproductions of maps, photographs, and objects, mainly coming from prestigious British institutions (the British Library collection, the UK National Maritime Museum) and private collections, with licensed permission to be shown only over three months. Organized by a well-known Gujarati cultural group, with a British curator, a Kutch-based NGO partner, and financial support from the local government, the project obviously had multinational interests and conveyed a nostalgic representation of a past golden maritime era.  Having conducted research on contemporary Gujarati seafaring activity, CAMP’s intention was to highlight that many more layers of this story can unfold, including the fact that boat ownership has shifted from dominantly Hindu trader communities to Muslim sailor ones. In this collage work, CAMP is literally annotating, cropping, layering, and extending “Gujarat and the Sea” in order to create a debate, bringing a contemporary and anticolonial perspective. The work offers a comment on the production of images within art history, and edits the official historiography proposed by the quoted exhibition: the peculiar frames designed for the work mimic the brackets of a quote. CAMP’s use of unauthorized copies of the exhibition is consistent with the pirate spirit present in most of their works.","CAMP is an artistic collective that started working as a group in 2007, initially consisting of Shaina Anand (filmmaker and artist), Sanjay Bhangar (software programmer) and Ashok Sukumaran (architect and artist). « CAMP’s “raison d’être” is that it produces and sustains long duration and sometimes large-scale artistic work. Its projects over the past five years have shown how deep technical experimentation and artistic form can meet. »  CAMP’s projects closely trace global phenomena: ships, CCTV, the emotional state of workers and guards, phone leaks, cinematic, digital and energetic media; within long-term research and collaborative fieldwork, which creates a real intimacy with their material brought to evolve in different shapes, and thus a clearly politically committed stance.  CAMP is also committed within the video and film worlds through larger projects such as Pad.ma (Public Acces Digital Media Archive: an ongoing online archival project, centered around video as a medium of documentation, collection, argumentation and exchange), fellowships for young filmmakers, an Indian cinema archive, and their own screening program organized on their roof top terrace in Bombay.",The Annotated “Gujarat and the Sea” Exhibition,Asia,"['sea.n.01', 'british.a.01', 'contemporary.s.01', 'undertaking.n.01', 'telephone.n.01', 'spirit.n.01', 'plan.v.03', 'map.n.01', 'town.n.01', 'institution.n.01', 'form.v.01', 'purpose.n.01', 'private.a.01', 'movie.n.01', 'activity.n.01', 'era.n.01', 'photograph.n.01', 'local.a.01', 'intervention.n.01', 'digital.a.01', 'layer.n.01', 'production.n.01', 'quality.n.01', 'collage.n.01', 'government.n.01']","['archive.n.01', 'documentary.n.01', 'colonialism.n.01', 'historiography.n.01', 'commandeer.v.01', 'pirate.v.01', 'bias.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/camp_portfolio_nov2013_-low.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/camp_portfolio_nov2013_-low-300x178.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/annotated-gujarat-sea/,"['Cultural/7.502551533433886', 'Society/6.7595655806182116', 'Politics/1.7092731829573933']","['Cultural', 'Society', 'Politics']",15.97139029700949,"['Arts/3.433484162895928', 'Culture/2.422008547008547', 'History/1.7777777777777777']","['Arts', 'Culture', 'History']",7.633270487682252,"['Cultural/51.525247791424256', 'Society/30.241874955110262', 'Individual_Personal/27.251909494014765']","['Cultural', 'Society', 'Individual_Personal']",109.01903224054928,"['Arts/18.11235725059255', 'Media/12.526587301587304', 'Spirituality/10.221545121545121']","['Arts', 'Media', 'Spirituality']",40.86048967372497,0.6666666666666666,0.3333333333333333
Willie Doherty,"“I focused on how the political and physical merged” analyzes Willie Doherty. Out of the Shadows II plunges us into a dark night lit by a few street lights in a deserted street where a car is parked in the Irish city of Derry. What is at stake is yet to be unearthed. The context of this picture is not revealed immediately. The pre-text or the information and interpretations made ??by the spectator puts the image in the “troubled” political context of Northern Ireland (a car bomb?) led by the sectarian resentment between communities (the wall evokes a zone of non-visibility). In contrast to the iconography of terrorism in the media, Doherty does not capture the moment of violence itself, but rather an “anti-headline,” the location of a possible confrontation, past or future. Thus, “Out of the Shadows II” substitutes the narrative of the event with a political image, embracing the event’s description with the aesthetics of the urban landscape.","Much of the work of Willie Doherty – as pointed out in his 2007 retrospective at the Kunstverein Hamburg and Munich Lenbachhaus – is built around Derry City in Northern Ireland, the birthplace of the Irish artist. His photographs, stories, videos, and installations are driven by the internecine war and political-religious agitation in Northern Ireland between the nationalist community predominantly Catholic and the unionist Protestant majority that has occurred since the late 60’s. The city and public space are the scene of civil conflicts. In the video “Three Potential Endings” (2008) political space is allegorized in the architecture. The work of Doherty transforms these “non-places” into sets. In “Grey Day IX” (2007), the idea of ??borders, understood as a separation is less cernable and more diffuse. Daily and anonymous violence in an intolerant public space is denounced. His images raise the question of the representation of political confrontation, through the use of codes in art and cinema, and by means of image and text. Tension, oppression, uncertainty, and fear are like a sub-representation without specific references in the picture.Willie Doherty was born in 1959 in Derry, Ireland where he lives and works today.",Out of the Shadows II,Europe,"['shadow.n.01', 'political.a.01', 'street.n.01', 'event.n.01', 'context.n.01', 'aesthetics.n.01', 'uncover.v.01', 'night.n.01', 'location.n.01', 'contrast.n.01', 'picture.n.01', 'future.n.01', 'interpretation.n.01', 'physical.a.01', 'community.n.01', 'violence.n.01', 'urban.a.01', 'light.n.01', 'moment.n.01', 'image.n.01', 'wall.n.01', 'medium.n.01', 'city.n.01', 'spectator.n.01', 'landscape.n.01']","['civil_war.n.01', 'possibility.n.01', 'car_bomb.n.01', 'ireland.n.02', 'irish_republican_army.n.01', 'urban.a.02']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/img-70.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/img-70-300x197.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/out-of-the-shadows-ii/,"['Society/5.18954248366013', 'Individual_Personal/4.0', 'Cultural/1.5555555555555556']","['Society', 'Individual_Personal', 'Cultural']",10.745098039215685,"['War/2.5882352941176467', 'Violence/1.6013071895424837', 'Mind/1.6']","['War', 'Violence', 'Mind']",5.78954248366013,"['Cultural/33.98916767786737', 'Material_Physical/26.813114989585586', 'Society/18.92170736040705']","['Cultural', 'Material_Physical', 'Society']",79.72399002786001,"['Arts/9.165701111753744', 'Urbanization/8.804725992961288', 'Media/8.772134238310707']","['Arts', 'Urbanization', 'Media']",26.74256134302574,0.6666666666666666,0.0
Michael Landy,"H.2.N.Y Skeleton of the Dump revolves entirely around the performance “Homage to New York” (1960),  of the Swiss artist Jean Tinguely (1925-1991),  during which the machine built by the artist in the gardens of the Museum of Modern Art (MOMA) had to self-destruct itself in 27 minutes, but, in the end, it had to be finished off by firemenbeing called in after it erupted in flames. Since the discovery of Jean tinguely’s retrospective at the Tate Gallery in London, in 1982, Michael Landy spent two years researching and sketching (charcoal, oil, glue, ink) from his previous research carried out  at Museum Tinguely in Basel, and at the MOMA in New York. By labor intensive work,  Michael Landy tried to recapture the essence of the event, to dislocate and to revive it with these the black and white drawings. He made them on several scales, some very small, some medium format and some, like this, large scale. Made with oil stick or white glue or both, he played on the idea of mezzotint as well as the idea of night time performance. The images are based on the film made of Tinguely’s action. Some drawings are made as though within the machine, and others, like this one, are made as though observing the machine from a distance. In certain drawings the machine is self-destructing, in others it is complete. Skeleton of the Dump shows the machine in lonely isolation, almost an outsider and rather forlorn. The motif itself is simply the white paper showing through.","One of the leading artists of his generation, Michael Landy’s work has posed serious questions about globalisation, recycling, regeneration and politics. Not afraid to embrace the traditional skills of drawing, he has also made large scale installations using multimedia. He is most famous for his installation, Break Down (2001) in which he systematically catalogued then destroyed all of his possessions in a disused department store. With sharp and wry observations on every-day life, Landy constantly seeks to question the relationship between art, institutions and markets.  Michael Landy was born in London, UK, in 1963.

Francis Alÿs,"The Nightwatch, which is an ironic reference to the celebrated painting by Rembrandt, follows the course of a fox wandering among the celebrated collections of the National Portrait Gallery in London. The path of the fox, from galleries containing 16th, 17th and 18th century portraits of historic figures from British history hung on plush walls, is circuitous and seemingly random.The fox tracks back and forth, sometimes inspecting the gallery furniture, often walking through the middle of the room but sometimes around its perimeter until eventually it climbs on top of a showcase, covered in fabric where he settles down to sleep. The actions of the fox are observed from the close-circuit television cameras which form part of the museum’s security system. Foxes are now commonly found in London roaming the suburban streets at night-time. They are in a sense flaneurs sauvages. The insertion of a fox in such an august institution is at once bizarre and yet in some sense perfectly normal. There is a constant tension in the film: will the fox do some damage, what attracts him to particualr places that he returns to; how does he decide where he will settle. The fox acculturises to the gallery in the same way he has become acclimatised to the city. The fox is an outsider, an interloper banned from the city that has re-inserted itself. Alys draws a parallel between the fox and himself. ‘No matter how long I have been away, I have one foot in a European culture, and one foot out… A lot of my work has played on the double status’. The theme of surveillance is multi-layered. On the one hand the fox is staking out the gallery; the portraits on the wall appear to be watching him; the security cameras are monitoring both the paintings and the fox and finally, we the viewer are observing the whole action.","Trained as an architect, Alÿs turned to a visual arts based practice in the early 1990s as a more immediate, direct, and effective way of exploring issues related to urbanization, to the ordering and signification of urban space and to the semiotics of its use. His work initiates with a simple action, either by him or others, which is then documented in a range of media. Alÿs explores subjects such as modernizing programs in Latin America and border zones in areas of conflict, often asking about the relevance of poetic acts in politicized situations. Documentation is central to his practice as well as painting, drawing, and video. In his work, When Faith Moves Mountains (2002) made in collaboration with Mexican critic Cuauhtemoc Medina, Alÿs recruited 500 volunteers outside of Lima, Peru. Each person moved a shovel full of sand one step at a time form one side of a dune to the other, and together they moved the entire geographical location of the dune by a few inches.

Evariste Richer,"Cumulocumulonimbus capillatus incus functions on the mode of a mise en abîme: it is a cube composed with 8000 dice. The work plays with chance, each installation produces a renewed visual combination. Robert Filliou said that Eins. Un. One… (16000 dice spread on the floor, 1984) “can materialise, materialises and will materialise with no limit to the most diverse forms or combination of forms.”  Richers’ sculpture acts like an encoded and pixellated image of an individual according to different layers of meaning: the weight of the work is equivalent to that of an average man (76kg); the colours of the dice recall those used in diagrams representing a codified human DNA; every choice that mankind has to make could be imagined as a roll of dice. The title of this sculpture refers to a cloud that provokes very destructive hail and thunderstorms. The sculpture is as fragile and threatening as this meteorological phenomenon – dislocation and explosion loom. In his work, the artist creates assocations between dice, hailstones, meteorites. Different levels of meaning (mankind, the cliCmate, games) are crystallised in this artwork according to concatenation logic that creates a whole. The artist links the individual and the atmosphere, microcosm and macrocosm, in a manner close in spirit to the sociologist Edgar Morin’s concept of complexity (etymologically meaning “what is woven together”), as a web of interlacing.","Evariste Richer constantly invents new standards for measurement which are mostly objects to prompt the spectator’s potential investigations: avalanche probes, a meter drawn from memory, a meter with no measurements… Meteorology, science, magic, mineralogy, photography, optics are his preferred terrains. The artist reveals meaning through displacements, changes of state such as the physical occurrence of sublimation (matter transforming from solid to gas). In Ecran (Screen, 2008), the weave of a projection screen is blown-up full-scale and takes over the entire room. Evariste Richer makes visible these micro perforations which are usually hidden by the film being projected; he reveals the infra small and ghostly. Blow up (2003), a tennis ball which has been turned in on itself, could stand as an allegory for sedimentation and concatenation. The concentration of meaning and gesture produces the artwork. The constant shifting between the cosmic and the infra small brings together knowledge and observation, certainties and the poetry of art. A piece from a meteorite can become a dice (Médéorite,  2008), a dice turning at high speed can become an illustration of the energy principle (Le grêlon noir/The Black Hailstone, 2008). Crystallisation – which was defined by Stendhal as feelings born in the imagination that become attached to an object to transfigure it – is the base of Richer’s work.

Eric Dizambourg,"Like the film Le Mouton noir, this dimension is counterbalanced by a burlesque element. The piece of fabric on the rat’s paw or ‘graft’ becomes a patchwork made out of colorful geometric shapes recalling a Harlequin costume, thus referring directly to the burlesque tradition. This leitmotiv creates a contrast with the dull colors, the humility of the countryside, and makes the figurative scene look unreal to reveal its superficiality.  The stiff character seems to be in a procession, while the introduction of the burlesque element transforms it into a carnival. The achievement of the picture occurs in two parts: first the painting of a figurative scene by the artist, and then the moment where the scene becomes absurd.","Eric Dizambourg was born in Créteil, France, in 1984.

Jason Dodge,"In Algeria, Djidjiga Meffre has woven a fabric with a string, a length equal to the distance from the earth to troposphere. Several works by Dodge, with the same title, follow this principle of measurement.  The work, like a synecdoche, is synthesized by its material and its implementation, both of which are fully part of the meaning. The work functions like as a concentrate. Shades of color and texture relate to multiple sensory and visual sensations, evoking a sky-colored night. It is by its concentration in the weaving that the distance can be represented in a concrete way and visible in one glance. To describe the work amounts to producing a story that echoes the myths surrounding the process of weaving. Above the weather opens up multiple narratives; in the etymological sense, the text is a fabric. We can see the work as a magic carpet that allows a moving “imaginary” of the spirit in the atmosphere. The weaving technique used in the work is frequently used by the artist, contributing to Dodge’s overall poetic aesthetics.","Jason Dodge extracts objects from everyday life – of which he adds minimal alterations by  the way that he isolates and presents them. For instance, he collects all the light sources of a house in “Darkness falls on Wolkowyja Poland” (2005), he samples the strings of a violin in “The viola duo of Bela Bartok” (2007), he records on a light sensitive photo paper in “Into Black” (2007), and finally he adds a bell brush chimney sweep in “Ringing Through chimneys” (2007). The artist goes beyond the silent dimension of the object to reveal their narrative potential, triggering fiction. The artist considers them as elements of a broader context. “I ??try to consider my work related to writing, but using a visual language,” says the Dodge. Name placards accompanying works are pretexts for further stories, supplemented by the imagination of the viewer and their inquiries. The artist, as a storyteller, reintroduces stories, the spoken word, and language in the space of the white cube. In Dodge’s work, the readable is not reducible to the visible. It operates like a trompe l’oeil, an image that gives the illusion of distance from reality, yet is blurred by the poetry of the intervention of the artist.  Jason Dodge was born in 1969 in Newton, Pennsylvania, USA.

Simon Starling,"Invited in 2007 to the Museum Folkwang in Essen (Germany), Simon Starling questioned its history: known for its collections and particularly for its early engagement in favor of modern art (including the acquisition and exhibition of works by Cézanne, Gauguin, Van Gogh, Matisse), then destroyed during the Second World War, the museum was pillaged for its masterpieces of ‘degenerate art’ by the nazis. Starling found photographs of a hang dating back to 1929, taken by Albert Renger-Patzsch, the German New Objectivity photographer. Firstly, he researched the artworks that were presented then which for the most part had been restituted or acquired by private collectors after the war. Secondly, he reconstituted this hang. Finally, he took the same pictures as Renger-Patzsch, with the same ‘scientific objectivity’. The result is simple and minimal, and tends to erase any difference with the original. Playing on the notion of author, Starling identically reconstructs (‘Nachbau’ means reconstruction in German), thus he realizes an exact replica of the photographs taken seventy years earlier. By blurring temporalities, the artist manipulates the history of the collections and questions the outcome of the images and the institution in light of this actual reconstruction in the museum. This work can also be understood as an absurd attempt to go back in time in order to correct history.","Simon Starling provokes unexpected crossings between objects, materials and events. He produces hybrid works that seem to come from another space-time continuum. In 1995, he used the aluminium from a chair designed by Jorge Pensi to reproduce nine copies of a beer can found on the Bauhaus site in Dessau, thus creating a condensed history of design in a rather trivial object, turning a piece of rubbish found by chance into the clue of a historical lineage neither absurd nor authentic.While avoiding formal creation ex nihilo, the artist paradoxically behaves like a true demiurge. His works imply processes of metamorphosis quite similar to alchemy. He appropriates forms and objects and integrates them into complex networks of meaning which do not aim at revealing a hidden history but rather at drawing unseen paths that ultimately exist only because of his intervention.Simon Starling was born in 1967 in Epsom, UK.

Aurélien Froment,"The Théâtre de poche video is inspired by Arthur Lloyd / “Human Card Index”, a magician who was famous for being able to take out of his pockets any image requested by his spectators. His coat hid over 15 000 different prints. In Aurélien Froment’s work, a magician presents images by making them appear, disappear or move in space. The performance is accompanied by a rather rudimentary sounding music that highlights the artifice of the magician’s tricks and places the whole in a comedic register. He also manipulates the images himself and creates associations which seem to spell out a meaning. It can also appear as a metaphor for artistic creation, ideas that coincide, hesitations and experiments that constitute a practice. Inevitably one also ends up making connections between art and magic, the artist and the magician, artistic technique with that of illusion. In this work, Aurélien Froment questions modes of representation pursued in the publication Théâtre de poche (volume 1) in which he interviews different people (an architect, someone working in advertising and a creator of puzzles) who manipulate images daily in their jobs.","Aurélien Froment was born in Angers, France in 1976.

Natasha Wheat,"Wheat’s work is built on a strong conceptual framework that weaves together commentary on social and political issues and the radical potential for change. Be Oblivion, in Disconnect (2011) is a sculpture and an intervention. Two cardboard boxes house white neon letters that collectively have the potential to spell “Be Oblivion.” The dismembered phrase is rendered powerless in its present state; the potential power lies with the viewer, who could conceivably reconstruct it. The boxes sit on wooden pallets of the kind typically used for shipping; by painting them white and repurposing them as pedestals, Wheat removes them from circulation as carriers of commodities. The simple cardboard boxes are also discarded shipping materials.  The words “Be Oblivion” are a seeming command to fade away into obscurity. This simple phrase resonates as a harbinger of defeat. Perhaps the provocative installation is a pointed statement about our collective loss of power: in politics, commerce, war, international relations, social issues, or all of these. Wheat asks us to resurrect her jumbled phrase in our minds, contemplate it, and see if it is time for an insurrection.","Natasha Wheat’s diverse body of work explores social experience as a sensual phenomenon that is riddled with hierarchical complexity.

Hank Willis Thomas,"Like many of his other sculptural works, the source of I am the Greatest is actually a historical photograph of an identical button pin from the 1960s. I am the Greatest presents the famous quote by Mohammad Ali to think about his important presence in the African American community. In dialogue with the painting I am a Man, also in the Kadist collection, this assertion that begins the same way takes the line from the protest poster several steps further. Ali never asserted that he was the greatest boxer or athlete, but had the audacity to claim that he was THE GREATEST [human being] of all time. For a man who grew up in the segregated south to rise to Ali’s iconic status and to be able to confidently and proudly vocalize his superiority was one of the most powerful, symbolic, and memorable moments in the Civil Rights struggle. Monumentally inflating the scale of the button embodies the ‘larger than life’ presence of Ali as an icon for African Americans to stand up and not only assert their humanity, but to be confident in their ability to succeed and rise up against all obstacles society placed in front of them.","Employing the visual language and terminology of mass media, and appropriating symbols and images from popular culture, Hank Willis Thomas’ work seeks to question and subvert established definitions and positions with regards to personal identity and the narrative of race. Working across installation, photography, video, and media work, Thomas maintains his photo conceptualist roots, primarily taking source material from found photographs and archives. These images form the basis from which the artist seeks to uncover the fallacies that history claims as truth. His work illustrates how the way history is represented and consumed reinforces generalizations surrounding identity, gender, race and ethnicity, and that as an artist he has an opportunity to expose or to revise those histories from the points of view of the oppressed.",I am the Greatest,Americas,"['african.a.01', 'presence.n.01', 'protest.n.01', 'poster.n.01', 'status.n.01', 'icon.n.01', 'american.n.01', 'dialogue.n.01', 'struggle.n.01', 'sculptural.a.01', 'iconic.a.01', 'celebrated.s.01', 'symbolic.a.01', 'south.n.01', 'scale.n.01', 'community.n.01', 'beginning.n.04', 'society.n.01', 'moment.n.01', 'historical.a.01', 'human.a.01', 'life.n.01', 'photograph.n.01', 'time.n.01']","['african-american.n.01', 'motto.n.01', 'greatest.s.01', 'best.n.02', 'ali.n.01', 'button.n.04']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/hank_willis_i_am_the_greatest.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/hank_willis_i_am_the_greatest-300x238.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/i-am-the-greatest/,['Material_Physical/0.8'],['Material_Physical'],0.8,['Environmental/0.8'],['Environmental'],0.8,"['Material_Physical/15.632234432234434', 'Society/8.523076923076923', 'Politics/7.584090909090908']","['Material_Physical', 'Society', 'Politics']",31.739402264402262,"['Land/7.255311355311354', 'Materiality/6.038461538461538', 'Urbanization/4.153846153846154']","['Land', 'Materiality', 'Urbanization']",17.447619047619046,0.5,0.0

Jason Meadows,"Jason Meadows’s Do Not Pass Go (2011) depicts Richie Rich, “the poor little rich boy” of the 1950s comic strip. As his steel outline gleefully makes off with a bag of money and a stack of bills, another icon of affluent America, Uncle Pennybags (otherwise known as the Monopoly Man), is crushed underfoot between two heavy blocks. Behind them lies a broken piggy bank, depicted upside down with eyes X-ed out. The scene represents the collision of two fictional worlds—both geared toward children—in which being well moneyed is assumed to be a universal aspiration. With the free market unleashed, these two nostalgic, seemingly innocuous figures are made to compete against one another in a confrontation that begins to read as sinister.","The Los Angeles–based artist Jason Meadows uses found and manufactured objects to craft idiosyncratic assemblages.

Colter Jacobsen,"The title Untitled Passport II was first used by Felix Gonzalez-Torres in an unlimited edition of small booklets, each containing sequenced photographs of a soaring bird against an open sky. Stacked in the shape of a cube and available for visitors to take away, the passports did not offer citizenship, but rather invited participation in a sense of borderless “being.” Colter Jacobsen’s Untitled (Untitled Passport II) is a diptych showing two-page spreads from Gonzalez-Torres’s booklet. The perfect graphite renderings freeze the book with its pages splayed, wings perpetually open. But we cannot help feeling that the boundless generosity of Gonzalez-Torres’s piece finds a limit in Jacobsen’s unique, but copied, original. These images are behind glass, their meanings overtly codified by the artist, whose notes appear in pencil around the edges.","Since 2003, Colter Jacobsen has gained in visibility and importance in the Bay Area art scene. His photographs, drawings, and installations are often evocative and possess a certain sublimity. The influence of artists from the Bay Area “Mission School” is manifest in Jacobsen’s predilection for creating installations and assemblages from materials bought in thrift stores, lost personal items found in the urban environment, and recycled packaging with unusual detail.

Daniel Joseph Martinez,"For I use to eat lemon meringue pie till I overloaded on my pancreas with sugar and passed out; It seemed to be a natural response to a society of abundance (1978), also known as the Bodybuilder series, Martinez asked male bodybuilding competitors to pose in whatever position felt “most natural.” They are obviously trained in presenting their ambitiously carved physiques, but their facial expressions seem comparatively unstudied. Against a bare white background, the men appear unexpectedly vulnerable, caught between performance and rehearsal, public and private. While they present themselves deliberately as exemplars of strength, they also inadvertently expose something about the value system that underlies their endeavors—whatever drove them to keep building by tearing tissue, and whatever makes flexing feel like the most honest pose possible.","For more than three decades, the Los Angeles–based artist Daniel Joseph Martinez has used every art medium at his disposal to investigate raw aspects of American culture, dipping adeptly into derangements of body and brain, individual and society. In one well-known piece that he produced for the 1993 Whitney Biennial, he replaced the text on the museum’s admission ticket with the phrase “I Can’t Ever Imagine Wanting to Be White.” Visitors held the sentiment in their hands and kept it in their pockets. In The House America Built (2004), he re-created in exacting detail the cabin in which the Unabomber penned his manifesto. While Martinez’s concepts are tight and concise, they leave ample space to implicate the viewer. His work prompts more than finger pointing; it catalyzes introspection, signaling the necessity of taking stock of one’s own role in perpetuating difficult yet ubiquitous images.",I used to eat lemon meringue pie till I overloaded on my pancreas with sugar and passed out; It seemed to be a natural response to a society of abundance,Americas,"['natural.a.01', 'airs.n.01', 'private.a.01', 'position.n.01', 'expression.n.01', 'background.n.01', 'building.n.01', 'society.n.01', 'public.a.01', 'white.a.01', 'performance.n.01', 'series.n.01']","['brawn.n.01', 'pose.n.02', 'vulnerability.n.01', 'performance.n.02', 'bodybuilder.n.01', 'countenance.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Daniel-Joseph-Martinez_I-use-to-eat-lemon-meringue_273_WEB.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Daniel-Joseph-Martinez_I-use-to-eat-lemon-meringue_273_WEB-206x300.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/i-used-to-eat-lemon-meringue-pie-till-i-overloaded-on-my-pancreas-with-sugar-and-passed-out-it-seemed-to-be-a-natural-response-to-a-society-of-abundance/,"['Politics/2.307692307692308', 'Material_Physical/1.6333333333333333', 'Cultural/0.8421052631578947']","['Politics', 'Material_Physical', 'Cultural']",4.783130904183536,"['Power/2.307692307692308', 'Media/0.8421052631578947', 'Time/0.8333333333333334']","['Power', 'Media', 'Time']",3.983130904183536,"['Cultural/5.368040293040293', 'Society/4.372405372405372', 'Individual_Personal/1.8']","['Cultural', 'Society', 'Individual_Personal']",11.540445665445667,"['Arts/5.368040293040293', 'History/1.746031746031746', 'Identity/1.0']","['Arts', 'History', 'Identity']",8.114072039072038,0.3333333333333333,0.0
Charles Gaines,"To make his series Shadows (1980), Gaines subjected 20 potted plants to a uniform procedure. Each is pictured four times: a photograph of the plant, a photograph of its shadow, a drawing of the plant, and a drawing of its shadow. Instead of lending structure to disparate entities, this system serves a counterintuitive purpose, dissolving the object. Just as meaning can be drained from a word through relentless repetition, Gaines’s thorough application of an invented representational system undermines the thing-ness of the simplest thing. Here, the artist effectively questions a concept as vast as objective truth by presenting an alternate theory of an object as ordinary as a houseplant","Charles Gaines orchestrates opportunities for aesthetic judgments, often turning mundane objects and spaces into newly indeterminate propositions. By adhering to self-defined processes, he explores the structures by which we make meaning, supplanting objective claims with the infinitely interpretable. Gaines is currently based in Los Angeles, where he teaches at California Institute of the Arts. He is influenced by John Cage, and like Cage’s, his work has served as a seminal guidepost for a younger generation of concept-oriented image makers.","Shadows V, Set of 3",Americas,"['plant.n.01', 'shadow.n.01', 'drawing.n.01', 'object.n.01', 'purpose.n.01', 'times.n.01', 'repeat.n.01', 'photograph.n.01', 'concept.n.01', 'structure.n.01', 'meaning.n.01', 'procedure.n.01', 'question.n.01', 'series.n.01']","['representation.n.10', 'empty.s.02', 'everyday.s.03', 'language.n.01', 'houseplant.n.01', 'thing.n.12']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/charles_gaines_shadowsvset3.jpeg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/charles_gaines_shadowsvset3-300x118.jpeg,https://kadist.org/work/shadows-v-set-of-3/,"['Cultural/10.040165553400849', 'Society/6.514285714285713', 'Individual_Personal/4.114285714285715']","['Cultural', 'Society', 'Individual_Personal']",20.668736981972277,"['Arts/3.298529411764706', 'Spirituality/3.257142857142857', 'Language/2.658119658119658']","['Arts', 'Spirituality', 'Language']",9.213791927027222,"['Cultural/29.0177494074553', 'Individual_Personal/18.225030525030533', 'Society/13.934798534798535']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Society']",61.17757846728436,"['Arts/9.161080586080585', 'Culture/6.2725274725274724', 'Media/5.667399267399267']","['Arts', 'Culture', 'Media']",21.101007326007327,1.0,0.3333333333333333
Ryan Gander,"Epiphany…learnt through hardship is composed of a bronze sculpture depicting the model of the little dancer of Degas, in the pose of a female nude photographed by Edward Weston (Nude, 1936) accompanied by a blue cube. The work refers to the positive occupations of space and the absence of form and structure, to the relationship between the visible and the invisible, to memory, and to the relationship we have to images and to our history. The work refers to childhood, biography and learning to question how meaning is made and how history is remembered and performed. The installation of the piece on the floor of the exhibition space rouses a physical sense of being-in-space to which we are often unconscious; we move into the earth as we approach the work.","Ryan Gander’s practice explores what-ifs, questioning the structural limits and rules of society and being. His work, which ranges from installations, sculptures and photographs, to performative lectures, publications, inventions and intervention, looks at the production of art and culture, to enquire into the processes through which art is perceived and valued. The spirit of his practice centers on development, education, and storytelling, hoping to evoke immediate and honest engagements by the viewer with his narratives. Gander is a collector.

Clemens von Wedemeyer,"Clemens von Wedemeyer has imagined a trip back in time at Breitenau. Starting with events that happened there from 1933 to 1945, the German artist has composed three stories that reach the years of the women’s reformatory, in the 1970s, with a different protagonist for each era. A work that attempts to bring out the “pathology” of the site, as the artist tells Bert Rebhandl, and at the same time its “unforgettable” status as a black hole in the history of Germany, that sucked up innocent lives for almost a century.     Text by: by Bert Rebhandl","Clemens Von Wedemeyer is certainly one of the artists of his generation that make intelligible our relationship to reality through the use of different transmissions of images, whether through film or video. The artist employs the documentary genre as a method in his analysis of reality. However, his use of fiction gives us the opportunity to examine different images. Referencing the work of Antonioni with “Silberhöhe”, he puts us in a genealogy of directors who have also questioned the complex relationship between fiction and reality. If the video “Silberhöhe” gives us clues to understanding some aspects of reality, the poetic dimension of the artifices of fiction offer more complex visions of the world.Clemens Von Wedemeyer was born in 1974 in Göttingen, Germany.

Walid Raad,"“The Lebanese wars of the past three decades affected Lebanon’s residents physically and psychologically: from the hundred thousand plus who were killed; to the two hundred thousand plus who were wounded; to the million plus who were displaced; to the even more who were psychologically traumatized. Needless to say, the wars also affected Lebanese cities, buildings and institutions. It is clear to me today that these wars also affected colours, lines, shapes and forms. Some of these were affected in a material way and, like burned books or razed monuments, are physically destroyed and lost forever. Others, like looted treasure or politically compromised artworks, remain physically intact but are removed from view, possibly never to be seen again. And yet other colours, lines, shapes and forms, sensing the forthcoming danger, deploy defensive measures: they hide, take refuge, hibernate, camouflage and dissimulate. I expected them to do so in the artworks of past artists. I thought their paintings, sculptures, films, photographs, and drawings would be their most hospitable hosts. I was wrong. Instead, colours, lines, shapes and forms took refuge in unexpected places. They hid in Roman and Arabic letters and numbers; in circles, rectangles and squares; in yellow, blue and green.

Chloe Piene,"The figure in Armless tapers away. Muscular legs turned upright spin down into a disintegrating torso. Lines, that in another drawing would sketch out contours and volume, here seem to be strands of flesh. They hang down from full feet and flutter into nothingness as the form becomes less and less present. The armlessness is named but the lack of a head, which one can possibly make out becoming strewn lines, suggests a top-to-bottom dissolution.","Chloe Piene’s work often depicts the body and its skeleton. Her drawings spindle extremities into thin loops of line and her sculptures stack skulls on slabs of clay. The fragile twisting of the body is executed in luxuriously rich materials, which underscore the virtuosity of Piene’s hand and vision.

Pratchaya Phinthong,"Phinthong provided 5,000 Euros to exchange for Zimbabwean dollars, the most devalued and worthless currency in the world. The ZWD has no legal status outside Zimbabwe. The exchange took place through a network of contacts rather than direct with Zimbabweans. The notes he received range from 1 dollar to 50 trillion. Placing the dollars in stacks and the stacks within a square grid, Phinthong mimics serial minimal sculpture thus reworking an old theme while providing an ironic comment on the value of art. From worthless currency the artist makes valuable art. The currency is no good for anything else. Thus what was once valuable but became worthless becomes valuable again, like the phoenix rising from the ashes. The ephemeral nature of the currency is mirrored in the ephemeral substance of the sculpture which is vulnerable to disruption from movements of air. There is no particular order of placing the notes since the work grew over the course of the exhibition as more notes came in. The final sculpture was intended to be a cubic meter of notes. The sculpture questions not only the value of art but also systems of exchange and the degree to which they are reliable. Like other works in the show where this work was unveiled, What I learned … embraces the concept of time since it is a sculpture that was accrued over a long period. Phinthong thereby asserts that sculpture, like film, can be a time-based medium and even to some degree performative.","Pratchaya Phintong’s works often arise from the confrontation between different social, economic, or geographical systems.

Gabriel Orozco,"Gabriel Orozco comments: “In the exhibition [Documenta 11, Kassel, 2002], I tried to connect with the photographs I took in Mali in July. I traveled to Mali for three weeks and took some photographs related to my work. They are very different, but there are links as the graveyard of Timbuktu, which I discovered during the trip. I found the cemetery because I was interested in pottery and ceramics. Research traditions of ceramics were the reason for my trip to Africa in Mali, to understand, learn, appreciate what they did, because it is an important tradition in Mali. And then I discovered the cemetery in Timbuktu. It is interesting to see how the work will take you to discover places you would never have discovered if you did not work. So the link between what you do and what you find in a second time is very interesting. In this context, the exhibition presents one hand tables with ceramics. In addition, photographs of Mali are on the walls. There is no direct link. But it is obvious that the same person who is interested in these things. And there are many reasons for this.","Gabriel Orozco could be described as a traveler-artist, without a fixed studio.

Jean-Luc Moulène,"This work is not the representation of a space but a real space that remains in the domain of sculpture which the artist develops in parallel with his photographic practice. Created for an exhibition in Kitakyushu in Japan, it is painted green, a color that symbolizes life and creation in Japanese culture. Even though we are confronted with a hollow presence, this is above all a space to lodge a body in the vertical posture of the living. This form can appear like a refuge – an isolating booth – that allows one to be confronted with one’s self, to construct a mental space. In the first instance, it can conjure up the formal questions posed in abstract art or minimalism, but, in fact, one quickly experiences it as an intimate space. It refers to architecture but remains far from any spectacular effect. There are also probably references to the history of relations between color and architecture.","After training in literature and working in advertising, Jean-Luc Moulène became known in the 1990s for his ‘documentary’ photographic practice. His images could be considered as studies of natural and cultural phenomena; the Objets de grève ( Strike objects) series (1999) documents objects made in factories during social protests. Moulène uses the codes of media images and diverts them to liberate the gaze and produce a new imaginary. This poetic tactic is manifest in the series called Disjonctions, in which Moulène photographs still lives, portraits, daily urban scenes. The notion of disjunction, which can be interpreted in the grammatical sense (‘or’, ‘either… either…’) or in terms of logic (an alternative in a dilemma), is manifest in the image by the disunity of the elements in the composition. The artist is not just a photographer, he increasingly creates relations with drawing, sculpture, objects, texts and newspapers. As a counterpoint, when asked what unites his work, the artist responds that: “An absurd evidence, a horrible revelation,a burst of laughter…” (Interview with Briony Fer, « Chaque quelconque », ibidem.) His works tend towards evocation rather than fixed meaning, inviting the spectators to invent their own tales in this “community of storytellers and translators” (Jacques Rancière, The Emancipated Spectator).","Head Box, Kitakyushu, October 2004",Europe,"['confront.v.01', 'space.n.01', 'color.n.01', 'japan.n.01', 'life.n.02', 'creation.n.01', 'japanese.a.01', 'formal.a.01', 'architecture.n.01', 'abstract.a.01', 'presence.n.01', 'real.a.01', 'photographic.a.01', 'construct.v.01', 'representation.n.01', 'mention.n.01', 'practice.n.01', 'question.n.01', 'culture.n.01', 'make.v.03', 'sculpture.n.01', 'body.n.01', 'history.n.01', 'life.n.01', 'form.n.01']","['symbolism.n.01', 'life.n.01', 'minimalism.n.01', 'abstraction.n.04', 'color.n.01', 'architecture.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/head_box.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/head_box-225x300.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/head-box/,"['Cultural/6.1945734434124535', 'Material_Physical/5.1692307692307695', 'Society/2.523076923076923']","['Cultural', 'Material_Physical', 'Society']",13.886881135720147,"['Arts/6.1945734434124535', 'Materiality/4.269230769230769', 'Urbanization/1.7230769230769232']","['Arts', 'Materiality', 'Urbanization']",12.186881135720146,"['Cultural/35.78320045967106', 'Individual_Personal/26.33626373626375', 'Society/22.671473297943894']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Society']",84.7909374938787,"['Arts/13.674836601307192', 'Culture/10.677319902319905', 'Spirituality/9.71941391941392']","['Arts', 'Culture', 'Spirituality']",34.07157042304102,0.6666666666666666,0.3333333333333333
Jean-Luc Moulène,"On a piece of paper, the artist has traced two loops in black crayon and placed two eyes where the lines intersect. Cut out of the same photograph, the eyes belong to the same gaze. The first asset of a slip knot is its simplicity, it basically requires a small length of rope. This collage is “apragmatic drawing, a kind of instructions manual” (« Paragraphes pour Jean-Luc Moulène”, ibid.) of Moulène’s work and photographs. Indeed, doesn’t one commonly speak of the photographer’s gaze? The slip knot could be a “a sort of vision’s hieroglyph”: the eye is the node of everything, the optic nerve is the common thread, the vector of information. This collage questions our gaze which cannot embrace both eyes at once (literally staring in the eyes), which is the point made in the series Les filles d’Amsterdam (photographs of prostitutes which place face and sex organs on the same level). In an interview, the artist analyzes his work by proposing a scenario that activates drawing: “in fact it is the question of the figure. Tracing is always a sharing act, something quite surprising occurs when the line loops back: this reflexivity produces the figure. Then one notices that by pulling the lines to separate the eyes, at a certain point they become stuck; and if one separates other lines then the two eyes end up stuck to one another. It is as if these eyes were rolling around in their own orbits. […] As such, I believe that thought is outside, that there is no room for it in the flesh. The other, social space, outside our bodies: that is what enables us to think”.","After training in literature and working in advertising, Jean-Luc Moulène became known in the 1990s for his ‘documentary’ photographic practice. His images could be considered as studies of natural and cultural phenomena; the Objets de grève ( Strike objects) series (1999) documents objects made in factories during social protests. Moulène uses the codes of media images and diverts them to liberate the gaze and produce a new imaginary. This poetic tactic is manifest in the series called Disjonctions, in which Moulène photographs still lives, portraits, daily urban scenes. The notion of disjunction, which can be interpreted in the grammatical sense (‘or’, ‘either… either…’) or in terms of logic (an alternative in a dilemma), is manifest in the image by the disunity of the elements in the composition. The artist is not just a photographer, he increasingly creates relations with drawing, sculpture, objects, texts and newspapers. As a counterpoint, when asked what unites his work, the artist responds that: “An absurd evidence, a horrible revelation,a burst of laughter…” (Interview with Briony Fer, « Chaque quelconque », ibidem.) His works tend towards evocation rather than fixed meaning, inviting the spectators to invent their own tales in this “community of storytellers and translators” (Jacques Rancière, The Emancipated Spectator).",Le noeud coulant,Europe,"['eyes.n.01', 'gaze.n.01', 'line.n.01', 'collage.n.01', 'figure.n.01', 'question.n.01', 'photograph.n.01', 'interview.n.01', 'eye.n.01', 'kind.n.01', 'common.a.01', 'photographer.n.01', 'vision.n.01', 'degree.n.01', 'paper.n.01', 'black.a.01', 'drawing.n.01', 'piece.n.01', 'social.a.01', 'body.n.01', 'space.n.01']","['disjunction.n.01', 'node.n.01', 'gaze.n.01', 'loop.n.02', 'vertex.n.01', 'slipknot.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/img-18.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/img-18-274x300.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/le-noeud-coulant/,"['Individual_Personal/1.0', 'Material_Physical/0.9090909090909091']","['Individual_Personal', 'Material_Physical']",1.9090909090909092,"['Body/1.0', 'Time/0.9090909090909091']","['Body', 'Time']",1.9090909090909092,"['Material_Physical/12.10896880896881', 'Individual_Personal/11.73230134158927', 'Cultural/11.083219171609263']","['Material_Physical', 'Individual_Personal', 'Cultural']",34.92448932216735,"['Space/7.235042735042734', 'Design/5.007125657280456', 'Arts/4.267760180995475']","['Space', 'Design', 'Arts']",16.509928573318664,0.8,0.0

Shaun O'Dell,"Shaun O’Dell’s paintings, installations, videos, sculptures, and music explore the overlapping realities of human and natural structures. Whether abstract or figurative, they often read like hieroglyphics, in that they piece together a philosophical portrait of reality. Purple Brush 8 is a painting that details a meeting of geometric forms, and the optical play that results. The halves of two monochromatic sets of concentric squares meet in the center. The joining of two sides of the forms gives birth to a third image: a diamond shape that radiates outward from the canvas. The work is characteristic of O’Dell’s oeuvre in that a simple gesture results in a much more complex proposition, drawing us deeper into a higher order.","Shaun O’Dell’s drawings, videos, music, and occasional sculpture explore the intertwining realities of human and natural orders.",Purple Brush 8,Americas,"['world.n.03', 'square.n.01', 'abstraction.n.01', 'form.n.01', 'installation.n.01', 'music.n.01', 'details.n.01', 'complex.a.01', 'play.n.01', 'set.n.01', 'simple.a.01', 'natural.a.01', 'gesture.n.01', 'center.n.01', 'structure.n.01', 'shape.n.01', 'portrayal.n.01', 'sculpture.n.01', 'video.n.01', 'image.n.01']","['dimensionality.n.01', 'geometric.s.01', 'gesture.n.03', 'optical_illusion.n.01', 'symbology.n.01', 'monochrome.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/shaun_odell_purple_brush8.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/shaun_odell_purple_brush8-300x300.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/purple-brush-8/,"['Cultural/9.17905056759546', 'Material_Physical/2.6', 'Individual_Personal/1.5555555555555556']","['Cultural', 'Material_Physical', 'Individual_Personal']",13.334606123151016,"['Arts/5.920880632954937', 'Technology/1.6470588235294117', 'Mind/1.5555555555555556']","['Arts', 'Technology', 'Mind']",9.123495012039903,"['Cultural/28.193157006392315', 'Individual_Personal/13.982965237377005', 'Society/12.285817106869741']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Society']",54.461939350639064,"['Arts/11.567515980751278', 'Culture/6.931623931623932', 'Mind/5.648351648351648']","['Arts', 'Culture', 'Mind']",24.147491560726856,0.6666666666666666,0.6666666666666666

Paul McCarthy,"To make Mickey Mouse (2010), Paul McCarthy altered a found photograph—not of the iconic cartoon, but of a man costumed as Mickey. On his shoulders he supports an enormous false head, Mickey’s familiar face grinning with glossy eyes. The artist has marked out in heavy black the background of Cinderella’s castle. Robbed of his context, the character becomes the sole focus of the image, a subject of unusual scrutiny. Under this close examination, his torso and legs begin to seem strange—too human for his extremities—and his friendly wave starts to look less like that of a childhood hero and more like that of a politician. With McCarthy’s intervention, the famous mouse is upstaged by his own artificiality.","Known for his transgressive performance art pieces that often challenge social conventions, Paul McCarthy is undoubtedly one of the main figures in the West Coast contemporary art scene.

Jean-Marie Straub et Danièle Huillet,"En rachâchant is based on the short story Ah! Ernesto! (1971) by Marguerite Duras in which the child Ernesto does not want to go to school anymore as all that he is taught are things he does not know. What interests Straub and Huillet is the avoidance of showing what the writer sees, stating: “we cannot illustrate what he sees, that would block the imagination…What interests us is the text which will be embodied in living beings, the dialogues but not the plot of the story… There cannot be a film where the text is more part of the people that in our films! Necessarily because there are months of work, the texts enter their nerve tissue. That is a form of popular culture.” En rachâchant addresses this tension between legitimate knowledge taught in schools and popular culture. Here, it is the student who comes with a new and revolutionary pedagogical system. The film is a lesson that teaches a form of resistance to the institution, and addresses a political reflection on the education system, as well as on the status of children.","Jean-Marie Straub (b. 1933, Metz, France) and Danièle Huillet (1936, Paris–9 October 2006, Cholet, France) worked together in film from 1963 and 2006. Their work consistently questioned the possible transformation from one medium to another—literature, painting, music and film—as a process of re-reading, re-inventing and readjusting of meaning. Klassenverhältnisse (Amerika, rapports de classe, 1984), from the incomplete novel of Franz Kafka, Sicilia! (1999) and Conversations in Sicily (1941), Elio Vittorini, and Une visite au Louvre (2004) based on Joachim Gasquet’s book, Cézanne, attempt to transform written civilizations into oral culture. Straub-Huillet pursued social and political change not simply on the level of content, but rather by employing specific formal techniques based on distinct practice of creative labor, working with direct sound and non-professional actors. Their cinema is defined by an aesthetic and political sharpness, by the use of long static shots, the care taken in the image and sound, with respect for the text and borrowed music.",En rachâchant,Europe,"['school.n.01', 'popular.a.01', 'child.n.01', 'movie.n.01', 'culture.n.01', 'status.n.01', 'cognition.n.01', 'dialogue.n.01', 'life.n.02', 'institution.n.01', 'form.n.01', 'writer.n.01', 'short.a.01', 'resistance.n.01', 'tension.n.01', 'contemplation.n.02', 'establish.v.08', 'people.n.01', 'political.a.01', 'narrative.n.01']","['culture.n.01', 'education.n.01', 'resistance.n.01', 'youth_culture.n.01', 'childhood.n.01', 'politics.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/en_rachachant_04.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/en_rachachant_04-300x231.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/en-rachachant/,"['Society/10.135464535464536', 'Individual_Personal/9.254945054945054', 'Cultural/9.057142857142857']","['Society', 'Individual_Personal', 'Cultural']",28.447552447552447,"['Spirituality/3.257142857142857', 'Time/3.195604395604396', 'Community/2.909090909090909']","['Spirituality', 'Time', 'Community']",9.361838161838161,"['Cultural/21.634542358226575', 'Individual_Personal/18.580365979050192', 'Society/10.882473082473084']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Society']",51.09738141974985,"['Mind/8.538607737291947', 'Culture/5.507692307692308', 'Media/4.897008547008547']","['Mind', 'Culture', 'Media']",18.943308591992803,1.0,0.0
Polina Kanis,"In the seminal video Workout, Kanis looks at the phenomenon of exercise in public space—specifically aerobics exercises in parks around Moscow today—as a broader lens for thinking about generational change. She leads a local group of participants through a work-shopped sequence of aerobics and marching. Each participant moves steadily and confidently in unison. Suited in western sports gear and found in a municipal garden in Moscow, the elderly locals follow suit as the briskly paced instructor leads the way. The sexual overtones of Kanis’ presence as an instructor pervade the video. While seemingly innocent in the taking of her exercise class, the opening of the instructor’s legs and the angle of the camera strongly suggests objectification and sexualisation of women in sport. Kanis’ performance work is a sophisticated tool in locating and deconstructing structures of generational difference, transitions of political regime, social remnants of the past and gender placement in society.","Polina Kanis (b. 1985 Leningrad, now Saint Petersburg Russia) is a leading video practitioner of the post-soviet generation. Kanis is a graduate of the Herzen State Pedagogical University of Russia (2006) and the Rodchenko Art School (2011). Her choreographed situations are symbolic of her time and incorporate a removed sense of nostalgia with a keen sense of timeliness. Her social staging reinvents rituals while investigating power dynamics of the individual in formed groups. In her approach, she exposes broken structures by using routine, rhythm and repetition.

Shahryar Nashat,"Employing both the High Modernist technique of abstraction and monochronism, as in the work of Lucio Fontana and Yves Klein, and bodily states of fetishization, Yea High (sweetpreparator) reworks the art historical canon of movement and the body to consider flesh as a physical construction of man-made matter. In the work, the artist uses perspiration as a medium on the surface, combing the man-made and the organic. The pink of the surface reflects the artist’s interest in reframing the way we understand the permeability of human skin. The creases of the plaster and the adipose surface enhanced provoke the skins surface susceptibility of scratches, ruptures, injured tissue and abrasions. The artist’s interest in the construction of the prosthesis, the aesthetic of the abject and bodily subversion is central to Yea High (sweetpreparator) deconstruction of the expectation of the image of a body, its performance and movement. By abstracting the figure of the body as a monochrome surface of constructed flesh, Nashat critiques the notion of perfection and expectations of the body, heralding autonomy and independence over purity.","The work of Shahryar Nashat (b. 1975, Geneva, Switzerland) is made up of the interwoven fragments of baroque and renaissance sculptures, humour, sensuality and insolence. Practicing largely in installation format, which give prominence to video, include photography, sculpture and etchings, the artist creates new opportunities for critical reflection about the canon of artistic media. With an interest in art collections, libraries, artwork reproductions and archives, Nashat imagines new forms of display through artistic reuse.

Shahryar Nashat,"In the film Hustle in Hand (2014) we observe secret negotiations carried out between two characters with only their torsos visible in the frame— negotiations that consider fetishizations, meaning and symbolic value of the body and flesh. Money, food, appearances, and consumption: the viewer is pulled into a round of transactions, a rumination on our society in which art occupies a coveted position. The film’s rhythm is suddenly interrupted by the appearance of a green polyhedron that, once licked by one of the mysterious protagonists, becomes golden yellow, a magical event accompanied by an intense swelling of violin music. As is often the case in Shahryar Neshat’s videos, the music, soundtrack and speech use surprise as a significant element in the video. Presented in a glass museum display case near a Warhol camouflage painting, the object begins to speak in a voice-over, demanding to be the exclusive center of attention and manifesting its satisfaction by a forced laugh. Another scene in the film shows a man displaying a scratch on his arm. The wound, the vulnerable body and testing desire with disgust are recurrent themes in Shahryar Nashat’s work. Hustle in Hand seems disrupted by subliminal images that disturb viewing and challenge our consented credulousness, our necessary candor while suggesting a parallel narrative to our subconscious. The installation space—with several glass and marble sculptures, presents a multitude of visions amid which the gaze shifts—giving our imagination over to these measured, odd and agitated ambivalences.","The work of Shahryar Nashat (b. 1975, Geneva, Switzerland) is made up of the interwoven fragments of baroque and renaissance sculptures, humour, sensuality and insolence.

Julia Rommel,"On the artwork, Rommel states: “I was reading Jonathan Franzen’s new novel Purity, where they take a lot of walks through the jungle in Uruguay, or Paraguay, I can’t remember. One of the characters takes a walk and jumps off a cliff; it’s kind of dark. The painting reminded me of a long, dark, and very serious walks in beautiful places.” With references to Howard Hodgkin in the incorporation of the stretcher into the painting and certain kinds of mark making, to Matisse’s cut outs and to the history of Cubist collage, Rommel has created a dreamy oeuvre that manifests her strong conceptual interest in process and unmapped journeys. In the making of Greetings From Uruguay, the artist paints on a stretched canvas, un-stretches it, repaints, re-stretch, sands it, repaints it, wipes it, cuts it, staples it, un-stretches it and so on until she reaches a definitive work. The painting resembles collages of shreds of canvases with the stretcher incorporated into the painting to provide relief.","Julia Rommel (b. 1980, Salisbury, Maryland) is an American painter with a strong interest in the art historical canon. Keenly aware of the precedents set by Abstract Expressionists as well as European Masters such as Matisse, her paintings are manifestations of a process of construction and deconstruction that eventuates in an abstract work that not only has a sense of the history of its own making but is also loosely associative in its reference to landscape. In her paintings, Rommel is less interested in signature brush strokes than in what she describes as using tools “to keep my signature away”. Her paintings act equally as research into color. While they are not attempts at color harmonies, the artist is interested in the conflict between colors and of using tones to eliminate one another. Rommel’s work acts between painting and relief, insisting on the objectiveness of the work.",Greetings From Uruguay,Americas,"['collage.n.01', 'remember.v.01', 'mark.n.01', 'dark.n.01', 'kind.n.01', 'strong.a.01', 'conceptual.s.01', 'journey.n.01', 'paint.n.01', 'artwork.n.01', 'mention.n.01', 'fictional_character.n.01', 'procedure.n.01', 'make.v.03', 'history.n.01']","['procedure.n.01', 'labor.n.02', 'painting.n.01', 'collage.n.01', 'surface.n.01', 'materiality.n.02']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/jr.2015.p.2303.greetingsfromuruguay.nil_.jpeg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/jr.2015.p.2303.greetingsfromuruguay.nil_-296x300.jpeg,https://kadist.org/work/greetings-from-uruguay/,"['Cultural/22.778865905336502', 'Society/13.02454212454213', 'Individual_Personal/8.156390977443609']","['Cultural', 'Society', 'Individual_Personal']",43.95979900732224,"['Arts/9.271631473102062', 'Economy/5.828937728937729', 'Media/4.870604395604396']","['Arts', 'Economy', 'Media']",19.971173597644185,"['Cultural/16.46597236612717', 'Individual_Personal/12.360312546071063', 'Society/8.461654135338346']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Society']",37.28793904753658,"['Spirituality/4.8126984126984125', 'Mind/4.247058823529412', 'Design/3.360066833751044']","['Spirituality', 'Mind', 'Design']",12.41982406997887,1.0,0.0
Erika Verzutti,"Made in cast bronze, Two Eyes Two Mouths provokes a strong sense of fleshiness as if manipulated by the hand of the artist pushing her fingers into wet clay or plaster to create gouges that represent eyes, mouths and the female reproductive organ. Equally, there is a semblance of fruits—their succulence and fragility. While the work is sensual, the matte bronze surface refuses any expectation of softness. The sculpture was partly inspired by a viewing of a make-up tutorial, thus bringing into play an interest in make-up, disguise and the face as mask. Experimenting with the body, nature and our environment, Verzutti examines the aesthetics of our society. Through her use of textures, color, contour, weight and consistencies, the artist references the mid-twentieth century Brazilian movement Neo-Concretism to locate the temptation of sensuality, the coldness of brutality and the image of flesh in the landscape and in society.","Erika Verzutti (b. 1971, Sao Paolo, Brazil) is a sculptor of haptic floor standing and wall hung sculptures that refer to principally, the female body. Openings, organs and skin are references that recur throughout her work, while also remaining interested in recalling images the natural world, fruits, plants and trees to suggest a symbiosis between the two. The works often have a strong sexual content and suggest physical sensations and provoke fantasies. They are playful, ritualistic, fetishistic and inviting yet repelling touch at once and the same time.

Malik Nejmi,"La Chambre Marocaine series is a means to reconnect personally to his connection to family history and objectively assess the process of reconnection. By creating this work in the Villa Medici in Rome, the neutral space—neither France nor Morocco—allowed the artist to distance himself with his history in the examination process. The series looks at Morocco through the eyes of his children and object belonging to his grandmother: a scarf, a cushion and a book in Arabic. The photographs are taken without digital editing in an attempt to return to documentation over artifice—to affirm the time of creation over timelessness. In presenting the photographs as a diptych, the artist questions the caesura, the assembly, the blessing. The transmission and understanding of the objects are not paralleled in both children—their experiences are unique and personal to the Moroccan objects. Referencing the photographic studios of the Arab world, Orientalism, and the studio of the Japanese photographer of the ninetieth century, Kusakabe Kimbei, Nejmi surpasses the schizophrenia of the search for identity. In defining the studio as a space of invention, the white and empty backdrop of the photographs eliminates distraction and allows for a reflection on fragility and the innocence of children. The negotiation of a transcultural and trans-generational relationship with the past, present and possible future lies at the heart of La Chambre Marocaine.","The practice of the French-Moroccan artist Malik Nejmi (b. 1975, France) develops principally around his relationship with his heritage to question the experience of displacement. Involving images and references to his family, and in particular the emigration of his father in 1971 and his return to the country, Nejmi looks to family portraiture, landscapes, and imagined spaces to examine the poetics of identity. In his earlier works, the artist showed the presence of a mutilated corpse resulting his cousins forbidding him to return to the family home in Rabat, the house of his grandmother. Najmi’s oeuvre studies how his existence within a double culture has returned against him and made him rethink today’s notions of exile, migration and placehood.",La Chambre Marocaine,Europe,"['studio.n.01', 'child.n.01', 'procedure.n.01', 'photograph.n.01', 'object.n.01', 'backdrop.n.01', 'history.n.01', 'documentation.n.01', 'creation.n.01', 'connection.n.01', 'photographer.n.01', 'japanese.a.01', 'eyes.n.01', 'digital.a.01', 'future.n.01', 'contemplation.n.02', 'century.n.01', 'book.n.01', 'series.n.01', 'personal.a.01', 'attempt.n.01', 'photographic.a.01', 'family.n.01', 'relationship.n.01', 'identity.n.01']","['family.n.01', 'identity.n.01', 'identity.n.01', 'history.n.01', 'childhood.n.01', 'document.v.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/diptique_fig1_2.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/diptique_fig1_2-300x230.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/la-chambre-marocaine/,"['Individual_Personal/14.079476079476079', 'Material_Physical/4.847552447552448', 'Society/4.769230769230769']","['Individual_Personal', 'Material_Physical', 'Society']",23.696259296259296,"['Identity/9.595959595959595', 'Time/3.2475524475524478', 'Familial/2.857142857142857']","['Identity', 'Time', 'Familial']",15.7006549006549,"['Cultural/35.64310662714889', 'Individual_Personal/28.651239549923766', 'Society/24.034310134310132']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Society']",88.32865631138279,"['Spirituality/12.140659340659342', 'Arts/11.663888888888888', 'Time/10.264646464646464']","['Spirituality', 'Arts', 'Time']",34.06919469419469,0.6666666666666666,0.3333333333333333
Otobong Nkanga,"Tsumeb Fragments was produced for the exhibition at Kadist, “Comot Your Eyes Make I Borrow You Mine” in 2015. In Spring 2015, Nkanga travelled to Namibia, making her way along an almost entirely defunct railway line from Swakopmund to Tsumeb. The artist was intent on reaching The Green Hill in Tsumeb, an area renowned for its minerals, crystals and copper deposits. This hill had been hand-mined by the Ovambo for generations, who took solely what they needed. However, when Namibia became German South West Africa, the colonial regime began to mine The Green Hill industrially, extracting and exporting tones of minerals each year. What Nkanga encountered in Tsumeb was no longer a hill, no longer an active mine, but a dormant hole in the ground. The installation Tsumeb Fragments is born from Nkanga sifting through her memories of Namibia, and the vast amount of material she generated and collected in an attempt to formalize intuitively felt and invisible connections. The modular structure of the tables enables the reconfiguration of the fragments. The mine and its history are presented in their many faces: the image of a monumental hole in the landscape to which the artist dedicates a performance, fragments of stones and debris, archival images collected from the local museum, and the fascinating vision of a floating cluster of copper. The arrangement of the installation challenges the traditional modes of presentation of research-based practices.","Visual artist and performer, Otobong Nkanga’s (b. 1974, Kano, Nigeria) practice weaves together concerns about land, natural resources, architecture and the dynamic status of remembrance. Pivotal to this is examining, representing and altering ideas of geographies, home and displacement. Her multimodal works spans performance, installation, sculpture, drawing, textiles, photography and video. Instead of focusing on the differences between distinct objects and environments, Nkanga focuses on their similarities and connections. For Nkanga, the crucial element of connection is memory, stating: “Memory is not only an autobiographical state, but also an important notion in relation to objects that leave traces”.",Tsumeb Fragments,Europe,"['fragment.n.01', 'hole.n.01', 'west.n.01', 'presentation.n.01', 'invisible.a.01', 'agreement.n.04', 'purpose.n.01', 'bear.v.01', 'tone.n.01', 'land.n.04', 'coevals.n.01', 'connection.n.01', 'africa.n.01', 'eyes.n.01', 'rock.n.01', 'local.a.01', 'vision.n.01', 'south.n.01', 'traditional.a.01', 'produce.v.01', 'government.n.01', 'museum.n.01', 'attempt.n.01', 'structure.n.01', 'image.n.01']","['colonization.n.01', 'mining.n.01', 'industrialization.n.01', 'mineral.n.01', 'memory.n.02', 'geopolitics.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/kaf-2015-otobong-nkanga-009.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/kaf-2015-otobong-nkanga-009-300x200.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/tsumeb-fragments/,"['Society/11.734199134199134', 'Material_Physical/6.633968253968254', 'Cultural/4.061152882205514']","['Society', 'Material_Physical', 'Cultural']",22.429320270372898,"['Economy/8.335930735930736', 'Environmental/3.3323809523809524', 'Mind/1.8']","['Economy', 'Environmental', 'Mind']",13.46831168831169,"['Material_Physical/25.75396825396826', 'Cultural/25.726007326007334', 'Individual_Personal/18.893192918192923']","['Material_Physical', 'Cultural', 'Individual_Personal']",70.37316849816852,"['Land/11.260439560439561', 'Culture/8.905860805860806', 'Mind/8.231288156288157']","['Land', 'Culture', 'Mind']",28.397588522588528,0.6666666666666666,0.3333333333333333
Zhang Kechun,"Zhang Kechun’s series The Yellow River documents the effects of modernization along the eponymous river, the third longest one in Asia. The Yellow River is considered the cradle of Chinese civilisation but also to be a threat, capable of breaking its banks at any time. It is also a region where Buddhism flourished, perhaps because Buddhist monks could not survive in other snowy and freezing northern climates.  Inspired by the novel River of the North by Zhang Chengzhi, the artist traveled on a fold-up bicycle in eastern China’s Shandong province, where the river discharges vast amounts of water into the sea, before slowly tracing it westward over several month-long trips heading to the River’s source near the Bayan Har Mountain in Qinghai. The areas surrounding the river had been devastated by flooding and Zhang attempted to poetically expose the emotional impact on the local population. The photograph depicts a Buddha head abandoned in the middle of a coal mining plant in Ningxia. A coal mine owner had started building a golden statue of a dozen meters but when the Buddha’s head broke, no one wanted to deal with it due to its symbolic significance. Pollution accounts for the foggy ambiance of his washed-out, hazy photograph of the Chinese landscape. Rarely featuring people, with an eerily quiet atmosphere, Zhang’s images show how human activities have altered — sometimes irreversibly — the fragile ecosystems around the Yellow River.  Whilst the project was not initially intended to confront environmental issues, Zhang found that ecological matters became unavoidable and the series hums with melancholy for the lost landscape.","Zhang Kechun produces epic vistas that dwell on the significance of the landscape in modern Chinese national identity, and the interaction between people and nature. His photographs often appear as documentary artefacts that halt the high-speed passage of time for a brief moment. He started painting when he was a child, studied art and design and, on graduating, worked as a designer in Chengdu before becoming interested in photography.","The Yellow River (A Buddha Head in a coalfield, Ningxia)",Asia,"['river.n.01', 'chinese.a.01', 'head.n.01', 'landscape.n.01', 'mountain.n.01', 'population.n.01', 'confront.v.01', 'sea.n.01', 'change.v.01', 'region.n.01', 'matter.n.01', 'activity.n.01', 'plant.n.01', 'china.n.01', 'photograph.n.01', 'effects.n.01', 'water.n.01', 'local.a.01', 'impact.n.01', 'see.v.05', 'symbolic.a.01', 'issue.n.01', 'inspire.v.01', 'document.n.01', 'series.n.01']","['river.n.01', 'buddhism.n.01', 'modernization.n.01', 'statue.n.01', 'pollution.n.01', 'deterioration.n.01', 'modernization.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_ZC_p2.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_ZC_p2-300x241.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/a-buddha-head-in-a-coalfield-ningxia2011/,"['Material_Physical/5.099719887955182', 'Society/3.911222111222111', 'Individual_Personal/3.413675213675214']","['Material_Physical', 'Society', 'Individual_Personal']",12.424617212852507,"['Environmental/4.276190476190476', 'Arts/2.4434124527003784', 'Power/2.307692307692308']","['Environmental', 'Arts', 'Power']",9.027295236583162,"['Cultural/31.983963585434182', 'Individual_Personal/16.92356532356533', 'Politics/15.540659340659346']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Politics']",64.44818824965886,"['Arts/10.625183150183151', 'Culture/7.452014652014651', 'Land/6.200102821155452']","['Arts', 'Culture', 'Land']",24.277300623353256,0.3333333333333333,0.3333333333333333
Wang Tuo,"The Interrogation is a video constructed entirely from still film photography and photoshop collage — playing out as a photomontage along with a voiceover. By using still photography instead the moving images, Wang Tuo creates room for the audience’s imagination. The voiceover produces a rhythm to enhance the tensions in the work. The work contains two intertwined narratives–one comes from an audio recording of the artist interviewing a local officer from the Commission for Discipline Inspection. In this interview, the officer talks about the psychological tricks he had used to succeed at his job interview. Then he describes the mental methods he always applies to his suspects during the interrogation process. The other narrative is a short story written by the artist and inspired by Ingmar Bergman’s movie Persona (1966). In the story, an actress who refuses to speak and the nurse trying to make her talk gradually switch roles and turn into each other. These two narratives together bring to mind the complexity of the reality that we are currently in. At the end, the role between the interrogator and interrogated , the actress and the nurse are exchanged. Questions such as the trust crisis, the anxiety and loneliness of modern men and women, the lack of security, the desire of being understood are uncovered.","Wang Tuo employs various mediums and a process that combines interviews, reality shows and the theatre of the absurd to construct a maze of melodrama. Through his performative manipulation on individual´s lived experiences and intervention in intellectual legacies such as literature, film, theatre and art history, Wang’s practice attempts to examine the unreliable relationship between the contemporary human status, myth and cultural archive.",The Interrogation,Asia,"['interview.n.01', 'narrative.n.01', 'function.n.03', 'method.n.01', 'rhythm.n.01', 'psychological.s.01', 'occupation.n.01', 'complexity.n.01', 'imagination.n.01', 'movie.n.01', 'uncover.v.01', 'short.a.01', 'local.a.01', 'audience.n.01', 'desire.n.01', 'write.v.01', 'tension.n.01', 'modern.a.01', 'collage.n.01', 'inspire.v.01', 'narrative.s.01', 'photography.n.01', 'construct.v.01', 'woman.n.01', 'world.n.03']","['question.n.03', 'question.n.01', 'movie.n.01', 'persona.n.02']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/WANGTuo_TheInterrogation_filmStill1.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/WANGTuo_TheInterrogation_filmStill1-300x169.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/the-interrogation/,['Cultural/5.984920634920635'],['Cultural'],5.984920634920635,"['Media/3.327777777777778', 'Arts/2.657142857142857']","['Media', 'Arts']",5.984920634920635,"['Cultural/29.793109118263928', 'Individual_Personal/26.625280421333063', 'Society/12.081404869640167']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Society']",68.49979440923715,"['Emotion/13.181618381618385', 'Arts/8.036374023293527', 'Media/6.629151404151404']","['Emotion', 'Arts', 'Media']",27.847143809063315,0.5,0.8

Cynthia Gutiérrez,"In Estratos II, a transversal cut on a white rectangular pedestal reveals an archeological world, pieces of history, that have been lost and that have lived covered by a sleek exterior. In this process, Cynthia Gutiérrez worked closely with an artist that creates Mesoamerican replicas.  In this series, Gutiérrez refers to her concern for a world that is about to become extinct. Gutiérrez alludes to the transient nature of humankind and its histories, its symbols, and idols. While giving support and stability to—typically—an artwork or an object, the pedestal or foundation also carries history. The work becomes a metaphor for all histories that are continuously replicated, transferred and nourished from generation to generation and for the remains buried under the surface of the present.","Cynthia Gutiérrez is one of the leading figures of contemporary art in Mexico. Throughout her research-based projects, she navigates around the relationship between past and present, memory and oblivion. Her work examines how time impacts both the symbolic and the material world, and how concepts like nationalism, victory, and triumph are the result of a particular moment in history that could vanish with time.

Curran Hatleberg,"Untitled (Man with Bees), from the series included in the Whitney Museum’s 2019 American Art Biennial, is part of Curran Hatleberg’s attempt to make sense of the current state of the “American Dream”, or lack thereof. “Without question our present American experience feels increasingly strange, unnerving and dreamlike. Our country is utterly different and changed now in its present iteration – surreal and confounding – and we can’t help but regard it with a confounded stare that we hold in reserve for the most bizarre and difficult circumstances.” This image is one, like many in the series that find something poetic, supernatural, and surreal in the common human condition of middle America. This beekeeper, who lives in Ohio, periodically allows the bees that he tends to engulf him—to the point where he must carefully push them back from his eyes, and face, to keep the swarm at bay. A potent metaphor for the struggle to see amidst the buzzing world that surrounds us. His head and neck swollen, transformed—half way to superhero or horror movie.","Curran Hatleberg spends extended amounts of time with his subjects, usually months, building a rapport, building trust, until finally making images with them. This process, of slowly and organically establishing relationships with his subjects, results in extraordinary images that have a sense of ease, as if the camera wasn’t present. His images tell stories, and in series often take the form of photo books, about the America that remains unseen from the vantage of cities. He travels to rural areas, and starts conversations, openly introducing himself from the outset as a photographer… but not letting the conversation stop there. His artist practice is very empathetic, not critical—it’s about seeing, and also knowing.

Miao Ying,"As part of Miao Ying’s project Chinternet Plus, a “counterfeit ideology” and parodic take on the strategy “Internet Plus” launched by Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang in 2015, the video work Post commentary, monetary likes, Morgan Freeman’s advice on reality constitutes a window on the Internet Culture in China. The video brilliantly edited presents various scenes from a popular Chinese live streaming platform together with extracts of a TV emission with Morgan Freeman talking about “What Is Reality”. This work is perfectly in line with the practice of the artist who questions with a certain humour the consequences sometime dramatic of the Internet as it went viral in the society. As part of “Chinternet Plus” the video was commissioned by the New Museum in 2016 for an online show and was exhibited in institutions such as the Ullens Center for Contemporary Art in Beijing in 2017, and the Gwangju Biennale in 2018, as one of her most representative works.","Miao Ying’s practice, including video, installation, website, photography and painting, highlights the attempts to discuss mainstream technology and contemporary consciousness and its impact on our daily lives, along with the new modes of politics, aesthetics and consciousness created during the representation of reality through technology. Through her works she emphasises the fallacy of a global internet culture while simultaneously underscoring the undemocratic use of networked power in both China and other regions of the world, such as the United States. At the same time, her self-diagnosed Chinternet (referring to China’s online culture and media spheres), Stockholm syndrome celebrates the ingenuity, humour, and intelligence of Chinese internet users, and the rich visual culture they have cultivated behind the firewall. Her works often adopt many of these users’ creative workarounds, which are strategies she describes in positive terms as ‘self-censorship.’ At last, she interrogates the dialectical relationship between the Chinternet and the World Wide Web, unspooling and parodying complex issues of global capitalism, online propaganda, and media democracy.","Post commentary, monetary likes, Morgan Freeman’s advice on reality",Asia,"['world.n.03', 'video.n.01', 'chinese.a.01', 'scheme.n.01', 'institution.n.01', 'china.n.01', 'popular.a.01', 'museum.n.01', 'center.n.01', 'society.n.01', 'consequence.n.01', 'practice.n.01', 'undertaking.n.01', 'question.n.01', 'culture.n.01', 'scene.n.01']","['internet.n.01', 'medium.n.10', 'celebrity.n.01', 'on-line.a.02', 'wit.n.01', 'popular.s.04']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/IMG_Post-commentary-monetary-likes-Morgan-Freeman’s-advice-on-reality_01.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/IMG_Post-commentary-monetary-likes-Morgan-Freeman’s-advice-on-reality_01-300x205.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/post-commentary-monetary-likes-morgan-freemans-advice-on-reality/,"['Cultural/7.314285714285714', 'Individual_Personal/1.0', 'Politics/0.9']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Politics']",9.214285714285714,"['Media/3.0', 'Technology/1.8571428571428572', 'Emotion/1.0']","['Media', 'Technology', 'Emotion']",5.857142857142858,"['Society/25.04100931747991', 'Cultural/13.96153307476837', 'Individual_Personal/13.167379988432621']","['Society', 'Cultural', 'Individual_Personal']",52.1699223806809,"['Land/7.235267656320288', 'Community/6.906893106893107', 'Culture/6.773168498168498']","['Land', 'Community', 'Culture']",20.915329261381892,0.6666666666666666,0.0
Hit Man Gurung,"Hit Man Gurung’s series I Have to Feed Myself, My Family and My Country… addresses labor migration, a phenomenon prevalent in South Asian countries like Nepal. The laborers, most of whom are young and middle-aged, come from marginalized and underprivileged backgrounds. They leave their families back in the homeland with the dream of pursuing a better life for themselves and their families. Sadly, migrant laborers are often subjected to exploitation. Abuse, slavery and untimely deaths are common among migrant workers. Gurung’s various media artworks are also a reflection on Nepal’s rapidly changing socio-political, socio-economic scene, the ten year Nepalese Civil War (1996-2006), unstable governments and the impact it has had on personal and professional lives of the citizens. In parallel the strong impact of global capitalism, the dramatic economic boom in Gulf countries/East Asia and their crazy investment in infrastructure development caused high demand of cheap labour workers, consequently contributing to various patterns of mass migrations. According to statistics, this recent wave of migration in Nepal has been the highest since the time of the two world wars.  During the world wars, hundreds of thousands of Nepali men were mobilized to fight for the British Army as Gurkhas. Those who joined the army almost exclusively belonged to the marginalized ethnic indigenous groups like the Gurung, Magar, Rai and Limbu. Hit Man belongs to one of these ethnic groups; men from his community have been serving as Gurkhas for several generations. However, the pattern of migration has now changed. People from his and other ethnic groups are migrating as temporary laborers; most hold menial jobs that do not pay very well. Nepal’s economy is heavily dependent on the remittance sent by these workers. Nepal is one of the top nations in terms of foreign remittances as a percentage of GDP. Yet, the government has not given serious attention to the rights of migrant workers; neither has it developed better policies regarding their safety. Gurung has traveled to his ancestral homeland and different parts of the country conducting research in order to explore how the social fabric of Nepal has dramatically changed over the years because of migration.  Since 2017, Gurung with his partner Sheelasha Rajbhandari have been continuously traveling in various parts of Nepal and different countries for their long term research based collaborative project, Who Are The Heroes of Our Time? This series plays on the notion of shifting identity and belonging by interrogating the label of ‘a migrant worker’ and ‘a diaspora’ through participatory performances, visual documentation and archival approaches.","Hit Man Gurung was born in Lamjung, Nepal and is currently based in Kathmandu. He completed his MFA from Central Department of Fine Arts, Tribhuwan University in 2012. Gurung actively participates in national and international art exhibitions/events in various galleries, biennials, triennials, and museums. Hit Man Gurung’s work is concerned with some of the most pressing socio-political issues of Nepal, including internal and international mass migration, the legacy of the decade-long Maoist insurgency in the country, as well as the recent pervasive effects of global capitalism. Deeply concerned with the impact of these larger forces on individuals, communities, and society at large, Gurung infuses his paintings, documentary photo collages, performances and installations with political conviction and personal poetry.","I Have to Feed Myself, My Family and My Country…",Asia,"['worker.n.01', 'state.n.04', 'change.v.01', 'family.n.01', 'war.n.01', 'form.n.03', 'impact.n.01', 'government.n.01', 'wave.n.01', 'phenomenon.n.01', 'occupation.n.01', 'british.a.01', 'strong.a.01', 'mass.n.01', 'research.v.02', 'life.n.01', 'dream.n.01', 'documentation.n.01', 'coevals.n.01', 'development.n.01', 'economy.n.01', 'common.a.01', 'global.s.01', 'time.n.01', 'fabric.n.01']","['nepal.n.01', 'labor.n.01', 'migration.n.01', 'capitalism.n.01', 'diaspora.n.03', 'migrant.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/IMG_from-the-series-_-I-Have-to-Feed-Myself-My-Family-and-My-Country-_-.-Photo-Credit-_-Kireet-Rajbhandari-.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/IMG_from-the-series-_-I-Have-to-Feed-Myself-My-Family-and-My-Country-_-.-Photo-Credit-_-Kireet-Rajbhandari--300x59.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/i-have-to-feed-myself-my-family-and-my-country/,"['Society/6.280701754385965', 'Politics/4.525146198830409', 'Material_Physical/3.4948830409356724']","['Society', 'Politics', 'Material_Physical']",14.300730994152048,"['Geopolitics/3.725146198830409', 'Economy/3.7222222222222223', 'Land/2.6198830409356724']","['Geopolitics', 'Economy', 'Land']",10.067251461988304,"['Society/24.140703903939208', 'Material_Physical/23.18103856927387', 'Cultural/18.20680708180709']","['Society', 'Material_Physical', 'Cultural']",65.52854955502016,"['Economy/6.631501831501831', 'Time/6.38836457659987', 'Arts/5.146794871794872']","['Economy', 'Time', 'Arts']",18.166661279896573,0.6666666666666666,0.3333333333333333
Sheelasha Rajbhandari,"Sheelasha Rajbhandari’s Agony of the New Bed brings out the familiar yet often ignored reality of gender discrimination and taboos built within the construct of marriage. The series of portraits of women from different age groups of Nepal are re-appropriated on cotton mattress placed on miniature golden matrimonial beds. The scribbles, texts and metaphorical images on the portraits embroidered with golden threads are representations of the range of vulnerable and resilient emotions experienced by females and the social beliefs towards them.  Gold is an obsessive compulsion in lot of Asian marriages both socially and culturally. Marriage is celebrated with the exchanges of costly gifts and gatherings. Brides are decorated with gold and other precious jewelry along with shiny red & golden clothes. But this sparkly glittery cultures are also hiding/ altering bride’s identities. Like many other countries, in the traditional marriage system of Nepal, ownership of a daughter is transferred from a father to a husband. Brides are socially forced to shift their identities and adopt their husbands’, just like they are made to abandon their own natal house & surname and adopt their husbands’. Men do not have to go through such identity alteration. This practice has contributed to the preference of sons over daughters, as daughters are supposed to go to the ‘other’s’ place and sons continue the family lineage.  From early age females are trained to be subservient, loyal wife & mother and be perfect in her ‘duty’ of managing household chores. After marriage female’s sentiments/responsibility towards her natal parents and matters like her career are supposed to be secondary. In the country where it is challenging even for high achieving working women, there is an alarming number of early, child and forced marriage. Numerous social research has documented the fact that a high proportion of married females (as opposed to those unmarried) become victims of domestic and sexual violence. Marital rape and women having little or no power over their reproductive rights are not uncommon. These factors have contributed to the development of mental health problems like depression, anxiety disorders and suicidal tendencies. Despite these challenges women have resisted, developed their coping mechanisms and fought against the unjust in their own ways.","Sheelasha Rajbhandari is a visual artist, cultural organizer, and co-founder of the artist collective Artree Nepal (founded in 2013) based in Kathmandu. She is interested in exploring alternative and plural narratives by learning the value of folktales, folklore, oral histories, mythologies, material culture, performance, and rituals and placing them as evidence, along with references to mainstream history and narratives. Her long term research projects and artistic practice often juxtapose these contradictions and synthesize the knowledge and experiences that result from individual and collective discourses. Through her works, she frequently tries to encounter the simple yet socially forbidden and taboo subject matters, with a focus on women’s struggles, celebrating their resilience. Her recent works explore the current transformation of Nepal from a once important centre for trans-Himalayan trade to a geopolitical situation in flux between the two emerging world powers of India and China. Rajbhandari is very careful about choosing materials and methods that align with her conceptual framework. She prefers mediums and materials that add meaning to ideas and have their own significance.",Agony of the New Bed,Asia,"['woman.n.01', 'age.n.01', 'identity.n.01', 'state.n.04', 'family.n.01', 'portrayal.n.01', 'social.a.01', 'father.n.01', 'mother.n.01', 'female.a.01', 'gathering.n.01', 'change.n.01', 'matter.n.01', 'familiar.a.01', 'exchange.n.01', 'development.n.01', 'red.s.01', 'concept.n.01', 'traditional.a.01', 'house.n.01', 'child.n.01', 'violence.n.01', 'construct.v.01', 'representation.n.01', 'power.n.01']","['marriage.n.01', 'nepal.n.01', 'sex.n.04', 'discrimination.n.01', 'gold.n.01', 'bed.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/agony-of-the-new-bed.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/agony-of-the-new-bed-300x237.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/agony-of-the-new-bed/,"['Material_Physical/2.6198830409356724', 'Society/2.5277777777777777', 'Individual_Personal/2.0']","['Material_Physical', 'Society', 'Individual_Personal']",7.14766081871345,"['Land/2.6198830409356724', 'Inequality/1.9411764705882353', 'Body/1.0']","['Land', 'Inequality', 'Body']",5.561059511523908,"['Individual_Personal/33.01583514524692', 'Society/15.32952978394155', 'Material_Physical/13.834152122387417']","['Individual_Personal', 'Society', 'Material_Physical']",62.179517051575885,"['Familial/7.387330316742082', 'Mind/6.774358974358974', 'Values/6.555311355311355']","['Familial', 'Mind', 'Values']",20.71700064641241,1.0,0.0
Xaviera Simmons,"Xaviera Simmons often employs her own body and collected materials in the service of her photographs and performances. Not to be mistaken as mere portraiture, however, Simmons’ works are explorations of the Black body in relation to landscape and other dimensions of non-linear space and time. Concealing and flattening her subjects with costumes and collage-like, abstract pictorial devices, the artist arranges archival photographs, printed textiles, and anthropological artefacts in configurations that highlight the power of visual culture to shape contemporary understandings of the self. Dressed in wax-printed broadcloth, the subject of Sundown (Number Twenty) holds a photograph of Black agricultural workers in her left hand and a zebra-like African mask in her right. The busy backdrop of tropical flora reinforces problematic associations of fantasy and exoticism suggested by the masked figure. Simultaneously concealing and replacing her own image, Simmons allows her individual identity to dissolve into the cultural constructs and histories that each artefact and image holds.","Xaviera Simmons’s diverse body of work is committed to multiplicity. Eschewing linear notions of history, her approach to investigating such themes as the shifting notions surrounding landscape and the conditions of African American female experience are cyclical in nature. Her studio practice demonstrates a fidelity to no single artistic modality or creative process; rather, Simmons’s interdisciplinary pursuits are in constant, active flux. Encompassing installation, photography, performance, and sound and video works, her evolving approach to artmarking is emblematic of the plurality of cultural experience and the myriad ways in which identity is constructed in contemporary culture.",Sundown (Number Twenty),Americas,"['artifact.n.01', 'black.n.01', 'photograph.n.01', 'body.n.01', 'mask.n.01', 'african.a.01', 'exploration.n.01', 'backdrop.n.01', 'association.n.01', 'dimension.n.01', 'worker.n.01', 'fantasy.n.01', 'fabric.n.01', 'relation.n.01', 'concept.n.01', 'abstract.a.01', 'individual.a.01', 'hand.n.01', 'image.n.01', 'portrayal.n.01', 'identity.n.01', 'contemporary.s.01', 'power.n.01', 'subject.n.01', 'performance.n.01']","['body.n.01', 'black.n.05', 'anthropology.n.01', 'culture.n.01', 'racism.n.01', 'inequality.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/IMG_20-Xaviera-Simmons-Sundown-Number-Twenty-2019.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/IMG_20-Xaviera-Simmons-Sundown-Number-Twenty-2019-225x300.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/sundown-number-twenty/,"['Material_Physical/12.570329670329672', 'Politics/7.047152194211018', 'Cultural/6.626232247284879']","['Material_Physical', 'Politics', 'Cultural']",26.243714111825568,"['Space/7.108058608058608', 'Inequality/5.428104575163398', 'Physics/3.131135531135531']","['Space', 'Inequality', 'Physics']",15.667298714357536,"['Cultural/44.66742783360429', 'Individual_Personal/23.996259622730218', 'Material_Physical/16.914707514707523']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Material_Physical']",85.57839497104203,"['Arts/15.577985902985903', 'Design/8.847511312217195', 'Media/8.192760180995474']","['Arts', 'Design', 'Media']",32.61825739619857,0.6666666666666666,0.0
Laura Rokas,"Like most of Laura Rokas’s hand-stitched works, Once in Two Moons was made while she sat in bed, imbuing the work with a tender sense of domestic intimacy. She worked with the heavy batting-stuffed fabric draped over her bent legs, pushing and pulling delicate embroidery floss through the quilt’s nearly 50 individual elements. Despite the strange, and at times menacing imagery, the fact that Once in Two Moons is a quilt—an object that is usually functional or decorative—is inescapable. But this mingling of associations is exactly what makes the work feel so fresh.  The scene’s dominant figure—a faceless woman whose blood red, dagger-like fingernails, polka dot jacket, and jet black hair resemble a sort of avatar of the artist—surveys a chaotic scene that might be described as a “cute apocalypse” (a phrase Rokas says is characteristic of her work in general). Parts of the tableau could be drawn from a spooky underworld. A two-headed ghost, a leathery snake, a voyeur in the clouds, and a cackling mouth with uneven teeth congregate amidst a catastrophic combination of weather conditions: rain, lighting, a ground splitting earthquake, and a fiery volcanic eruption. Others are oddly specific and seemingly nonsensical—a pink flag stuck into an orange traffic cone, or a vehicle engulfed in flames—until you know that Rokas stumbled across the roadside sculpture one day in the Tenderloin in San Francisco, and the cop car belonged to Rokas’s friend and was set on fire while parked on the street in Oakland. And if you look closely, you’ll notice a cell phone peeking out of the woman’s pocket, its calendar reading Friday the 13th—a superstitious day for many, and in particular for Rokas, as she was involved in a terrible accident on that date many years ago. She no longer goes out when that auspicious time rolls around, but perhaps her alternate self in another universe did, and is now bearing witness to the consequences. Regardless of the meaning one reads into it, Once in Two Moons opens a pandora’s box of questions about the choices we make day to day, and how much our understanding of it is influenced by the images we ingest, and the events we encounter.","Laura Rokas is a painter, ceramicist, and textile artist. While her formal training is primarily in painting, Rokas’s practice embodies a spirit of dedicated amateurism characteristic of a generation that grew up figuring out how to make creative use of new technologies—and eventually—the materials of the internet and digital communication more broadly. Like early users of the internet who patched together elementary code they copy and pasted from other pages to create their own websites, or budding designers who messed around with Microsoft Paint to make custom backgrounds and images for their computers, Rokas goes about building something new by testing out very basic methods with whatever materials she is drawn to. This approach informs every aspect of her work, and is something she started practicing early on. Both Rokas’s mother and sister are quilters, and she learned by watching them, listening to their stories, and asking questions. But she mostly developed her textile (and ceramic) skills by doing. For Rokas, there’s no “right” way to do something—she says, “Did it get done? Then you did it right.”  Rokas’s work incorporates her lived experience and remixes it with visual references, symbols, and themes drawn from pop culture, literature, and science fiction. In particular, she likes to rework familiar symbols because of their psychological power. As she says, it’s easy to forget how influential they can be because we’re so constantly inundated by them; but even basic combinations of color and shape are powerful, and we’re attracted to those things on a base level. The potency of her work comes from her ability to exploit and recontextualize this familiar pop culture iconography in a way that may at first seem simplistic. But if you spend any more than a passing moment with it, everything starts to fall off a cliff. Rokas’s interpretations gravitate toward the uncanny, dealing with alternate realities, twins, doubles, and doppelgängers—the realm of “what if,” “what could have been,” and the just plain weird. And since Rokas never offers a Rosetta Stone to decode the work, the viewer is often left with more questions than answers, and that’s just fine with her.",Once in Two Moons,Americas,"['day.n.01', 'woman.n.01', 'scene.n.01', 'hair.n.01', 'ghost.n.01', 'telephone.n.01', 'phrase.n.01', 'witness.n.01', 'reading.n.01', 'san_francisco.n.01', 'imagination.n.02', 'pull.v.01', 'kind.n.01', 'flag.n.01', 'universe.n.01', 'times.n.01', 'combination.n.01', 'box.n.01', 'association.n.01', 'land.n.04', 'specific.a.01', 'put.v.01', 'fabric.n.01', 'red.s.01', 'individual.a.01']","['domesticity.n.02', 'iconography.n.01', 'feminine.n.01', 'supernatural.a.01', 'apocalyptic.a.02', 'superstition.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/001.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/001-300x300.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/once-in-two-moons/,"['Cultural/15.583755296990596', 'Individual_Personal/12.523423944476578', 'Society/6.514285714285713']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Society']",34.621464955752884,"['Spirituality/5.7714285714285705', 'Culture/3.964835164835165', 'Media/3.301373626373626']","['Spirituality', 'Culture', 'Media']",13.037637362637362,"['Material_Physical/20.715282103517403', 'Individual_Personal/13.815987933634995', 'Society/13.00731315468158']","['Material_Physical', 'Individual_Personal', 'Society']",47.53858319183398,"['Space/9.160159448394744', 'Urbanization/5.0109761583445795', 'Design/4.987203585887796']","['Space', 'Urbanization', 'Design']",19.158339192627118,0.6666666666666666,0.0
Miri Segal,"The work BRB is a 30 min. journey in the new game world of Second Life (“SL”). Consistent with Segal’s work with the projected image, this video was shot using a virtual in-world camera, with the footage later being transformed by a software custom designed by the artist. The video explores the idea of masks we wear in SL and real life (“RL”), and the differences in communication within those two worlds. When somebody “speaks,” his or her avatar is seen typing, a mechanical ticking sound is heard, and words appear as text on the screen, strengthening the feeling that the conversation is taking place inside of our head. The video creates a new relation to the body and a new form of intimacy. We seem to engage this new form by chance, using the game’s search engine Segal’s avatar sometimes appears with a Google search page as a mask, perhaps as a salute to another icon of cyber culture. With BRB, roaming in SL is like wandering inside our collective sub-conscious.","Miri Segal’s work relates to questions concerning the nature of life, the role of images, and the relationship between the two, whilst systematically exposing the nuances of perception. Her work generally focuses on the video medium, though Segal claims not to be a video artist, rather as a scholar of phenomena, from the laws of math to those of awareness and consciousness. Her video installations incorporate playful tricks, diversions, or deceptions. Such is the case with Closed Circuit (2000), a work depicting a dancing woman hugging herself. Looking closer, images of the woman are shot from front and back and then projected from opposite sides of the room onto a sheet of glass, so that her two sides overlap, back turning into front, front turning into back. The effect is that the woman’s arms appear as if they encircle her own body. Another work, a more technically elaborate musing on illusion, Foreshadowing (2001), uses complex modeling software to create and operate a synthetic image of a spinning roulette wheel. Screened high above viewers’ heads, the wheel is intermittently overlaid by a seemingly random number, flashed so briefly as to be nearly subliminal, which none the less always reliably ‘predicts’ the winner. With each round the ostensibly chance-determined outcome of the game invariably fulfills the expectations of the tipped-off viewer.

Fikret Atay,"In the video Rebels of the Dance, two boys are filmed dancing to traditional Kurdish songs inside of the confined space of an ATM. Shy, proud and joyful, the two boys appear to be influenced by a third person – the artist and his camera. Their play of eyes creates an atmosphere reminding one of the close scrutiny and state control of the Kurdish population. While Atay films, the music grows and intensifies, and the ATM machine becomes a simple decor for the scene, losing its proper function. As if in a state of triumph, music and dance take on the role of a new language of power, juxtaposing local identity with an international dimension of the city and country. This simple performance gives meaning to the geographical and political situation of Batman, whose oil resources are rich, although its citizens rarely reap benefit from its natural wealth.  *This title is a variation of a televised transmission representing 90 folk dancers “Sultans of the Dance” which was a big success in Turkey.","It is said that the artist Fikret Atay secretly stole his parent’s camera to film the city of Batman and its citizens in East Turkey. His first experiments later transformed themselves into his first videos such as Fast and Best (2002) and Rebels of the Dance (2002). The city of Batman is a mid-sized Turkish city situated on the border with Irak. Its geographical and political situation inevitably contextualizes the work of Atay and inside of this context is Atay’s focus on the city’s citizens, its communities and traditions, whether linguistic, family orientated, musical or religious. Camera in hand, Atay makes short videos of everyday life. Despite the fact that they are direct and spontaneous, the images conserve an ambiguity, at times mysterious from a outsider’s point of view. In this regard, Atay translates reality while adhering to a larger grain of complexity. Fikret Atay was born in Batman, Turkey in 1976.

Alain Séchas,"Coué 1 is an animated sculpture that hypnotically highlights the self-motivating leitmotiv of the ‘Coué Method’: “Every day, in every way, I’m getting better and better.”This is the mantra that is repeated by different male and female voices in the soundtrack – first in an incomprehensible painfully slow slur, becoming clear and speeding up into a drilling hilarious sounding high pitching spin, as if helium had been inhaled. This work was commissioned by the Association GEF Psy in Nancy under the aegis of the Fondation de France in order to commemorate Emile Coué (1857-1926) who was a French behavioral psychologist and pharmacist who particularly studied the effects of positive thinking. Séchas also created a Monument to Jacques Lacan in 2002 featuring the cat, his house-style character.  Through direct bodily experience, the spiraling apparatus is supposed to trap the spectator into seeing and hearing with direct reference to Marcel Duchamp’s Anemic Cinema and Rotoreliefs from the late 1920s and 1930s.

Eleanor Antin,"Comprised of fifty-one photographic postcards, Antin’s 100 Boots is an epic visual narrative in which 100 black rubber boots stand in for a fictional “hero” making a “trip” from California to New York City. Over two-and-a-half years, Antin photographed the boots against different backdrops across the U.S., and then turned the pictures into postcards, which she then mailed to approximately 1,000 people around the world. In conjunction with the boots’ “arrival” in New York City, the postcards were exhibited at the Museum of Modern Art. The project speaks not only to the reproduction and dissemination of images, but also about how the material reality of the images—their settings and their existence in mailboxes—was in stark contrast to the everyday lives of the people who received the cards. As with all “mail art” which had begun with the Fluxus movement in the late 1950s and was on the rise in the late 1960s, using the postal service enabled artists to completely bypass the traditional art-world distribution system, and allowed Antin to expand or compress time as the narrative required.","Over a roughly thirty-year period, conceptual and multidisciplinary artist Eleanor Antin has been creating narrative images in photography, video, film, performance, and installation. Her practices blur fiction and history, often with humorous wit, theatrical sensibility, and allegorical impulse. During her early career, Antin was associated with a group of artists who were recognized for returning the element of narrative to contemporary art, which until the 1970s had been dominated by highly abstract, purist work.",100 Boots,Americas,"['new_york.n.01', 'york.n.01', 'late.a.01', 'city.n.01', 'people.n.01', 'narrative.n.01', 'everyday.s.01 life.n.01', 'being.n.01', 'backdrop.n.01', 'california.n.01', 'fictional.a.01', 'setting.n.01', 'contrast.n.01', 'picture.n.01', 'traditional.a.01', 'museum.n.01', 'everyday.s.01', 'photographic.a.01', 'artist.n.01', 'black.a.01', 'motion.n.03', 'world.n.03', 'undertaking.n.01', 'ocular.a.02', 'life.n.01']","['hero.n.02', 'distribution.n.03', 'journey.n.01', 'materiality.n.02', 'bypass.v.01', 'stand-in.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/img-560.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/img-560-235x300.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/100-boots/,"['Politics/9.32708694813958', 'Cultural/6.323676323676323', 'Society/4.793522267206478']","['Politics', 'Cultural', 'Society']",20.44428553902238,"['Power/3.076923076923077', 'Activism/3.0695970695970693', 'Arts/2.3493173493173494']","['Power', 'Activism', 'Arts']",8.495837495837495,"['Society/19.64820592204493', 'Material_Physical/18.42336029983089', 'Cultural/16.666242744183922']","['Society', 'Material_Physical', 'Cultural']",54.737808966059745,"['Urbanization/9.63023206583578', 'Land/8.82483660130719', 'Geopolitics/5.692810457516339']","['Urbanization', 'Land', 'Geopolitics']",24.147879124659312,0.6666666666666666,0.0
Joe Scanlan,"Spring Line is a piece shown for the first time in his solo exhibition at the Institut d’Art Contemporain in Villeurbanne in 2007. It pays homage to the work of the famous conceptual artist Sol LeWitt, who had died on 8 April that year. Scanlan aims to guide the spectator to gage the level of influence Sol LeWitt has had on his work with regards the conversion of potential ideas into sculpture. Forsythia stems, a theme in his work of the last 7 years, are seen as concrete drawings where each stem is a line in space and each flower a mark. Taking the concept of Sol LeWitt’s instructions in which the artwork exists first as an idea before realization, Spring Line applies the same principle by which an artwork exists first of all as a mobile box prior to installation. The way in which the drawings are exhibited in space can vary: in Villeurbanne they were dispersed, during the Armory Show the stems all stayed in the box, in Amsterdam only 5 drawings were created, the other stems stayed in the box. Thus Spring Line is a variable image which is adaptable to any space and reinvented each time. The forsythia motif resonates with this idea, since it is a flower that renews itself constantly in the cycle of seasons – eternal and forever new.","Joe Scanlan became known in the 1990s due to his very particular appropriation of Conceptual art, exploiting two main registers: display on one hand, designating the artwork as a consumable product, DIY on the other, advocating the mobility and adaptability of objects, even their reversibility depending on contexts and usages. Scanlan’s work turns out to be reversible. A shelf can appear to be a minimal construction and be used as a shelf, as implied by functional logic. The technical simplicity of Scanlan’s realizations purposely leaning towards low-tech, with subsidiary possibilities for most of them to be de-installed and stored with no difficulty, convey something practical (art can be concretely useful) and aesthetic (each one of the artist’s creations carries a specific function but also has its own plastic qualities) in the work. Thus Joe Scanlan’s practice involves strategies that question the market and the value of a work of art. Extremely surprised by the attitude of students who are already wooed by galleries while they are still training, he invents Donnelle Woolford, a fictional artist he launches in the art world (with exhibitions, press articles, CV, facebook page, etc.). Beyond the conceptual aspect of his work, his approach focuses on the ephemeral nature of things, objects, lives. The artist’s recent research, into the production of snowflakes or reconstituted forsythias, reveal his constant interest in what is transitory or ephemeral. This poetic tendency is becoming more and more present in Scanlan’s work which always combines critical and independent standpoints.",Spring Line,Americas,"['box.n.01', 'idea.n.01', 'drawing.n.01', 'artwork.n.01', 'space.n.01', 'potential.a.01', 'mark.n.01', 'motif.n.01', 'conceptual.s.01', 'time.n.01', 'celebrated.s.01', 'degree.n.01', 'concept.n.01', 'subject.n.01', 'make.v.03', 'spectator.n.01', 'sculpture.n.01', 'piece.n.01']","['adaptation.n.02', 'influence.n.04', 'idea.n.01', 'stalk.n.02', 'flower.n.01', 'variation.n.07']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/img-684.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/img-684-232x300.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/spring-line/,"['Individual_Personal/13.314285714285717', 'Cultural/5.728937728937728', 'Material_Physical/3.228937728937729']","['Individual_Personal', 'Cultural', 'Material_Physical']",22.272161172161177,"['Values/5.12967032967033', 'Mind/5.107692307692307', 'Culture/3.269230769230769']","['Values', 'Mind', 'Culture']",13.506593406593407,"['Cultural/22.99256609403669', 'Individual_Personal/21.208058608058614', 'Material_Physical/6.312820512820513']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Material_Physical']",50.51344521491582,"['Values/8.577289377289377', 'Mind/7.953846153846154', 'Culture/7.154700854700855']","['Values', 'Mind', 'Culture']",23.68583638583639,1.0,1.0
Harun Farocki,"For Immersion, Harun Farocki went to visit a research centre near Seattle specialized in the development of virtual realities and computer simulations. One of their projects consists in using virtual reality (environments created to simulate this world) for therapeutic reasons for soldiers suffering traumas after the Iraq war. The double projection creates a parallel between animations and testimonies by soldiers reliving their mission, the explosions, gunshots and ambushes, their fears and their guilt. The chosen direct rendering and simplicity of the edit places us like the voyeur of a personal and difficult experience. The end is disconcerting since the last soldier, who one minute had been pleading his therapist to stop the program, looks at his audience and smiles with a detachment that sheds doubt on the authenticity of his account. The Virtual Iraq program is closer to a virtual game than a therapeutic program. Immersion continues to explore the impact of new technologies on society, the relations between virtual reality and the military world and how the scenarios developed as video games are used as training tools as much as a therapy. (Read Artslant)","In the 1970s and 80s, the feature films Harun Farocki made contributed to theorizing essay-films, a cinema genre that juxtaposes archival images of different sources (news, film industry) with voiceover commentaries. More specifically it is a critical and political approach to the image that has characterized his oeuvre since the start, a point of view on the connections between war, technology and capitalism. In 1969, he makes one of his first films in 16mm called Inextinguishable Fire in which he appears as a TV presenter reading out the testimony of a Vietnamese victim of a Napalm attack. The subsequent images are like an educational documentary, an austere thesis on the origins of napalm production and the involvement of workers, students and engineers in what was largely used as a weapon against civilians. Years later, for the trilogy Eye/Machine (2001-2003), Farocki collects sequences filmed during the Gulf War, like images from projectiles, juxtaposed with images produced by machines made for surveillance, recognition and localization. The art historian Hal Foster describes Farocki’s work like a genealogy of ‘visual instrumentalization’ following the evolution of image technologies and their roles in power struggles and the exercise of control. At the beginning of the 1990s he begins to imagine double projections that were presented in cinemas and soon in galleries and institutions that could easily adapt to this mode of projection. The evolution of the forms of presentation and distribution of his work explains his presence in various economies and most recently that of the art market.  Harun Farocki was born in 1944 in Neutitschein, Czech Republic. He lived and worked in Berlin where he passed away in 2014.","Serious Games 3, Immersion",Europe,"['soldier.n.01', 'plan.n.01', 'game.n.01', 'world.n.03', 'animation.n.01', 'injury.n.01', 'fear.n.01', 'research.v.02', 'direct.a.01', 'military.a.01', 'tool.n.01', 'development.n.01', 'projection.n.01', 'technology.n.01', 'impact.n.01', 'audience.n.01', 'environment.n.01', 'personal.a.01', 'society.n.01', 'war.n.01', 'undertaking.n.01', 'experience.n.01', 'make.v.03']","['posttraumatic_stress_disorder.n.01', 'voyeurism.n.01', 'virtual_reality.n.01', 'testimony.n.02', 'computer_game.n.01', 'therapy.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/img-649.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/img-649-300x168.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/immersion/,"['Cultural/6.273821809425524', 'Society/1.0', 'Individual_Personal/1.0']","['Cultural', 'Society', 'Individual_Personal']",8.273821809425524,"['Media/3.548675610595115', 'Technology/1.9473684210526314', 'Body/1.0']","['Media', 'Technology', 'Body']",6.496044031647747,"['Individual_Personal/32.993942624283186', 'Society/25.347205735441037', 'Cultural/24.50374919198449']","['Individual_Personal', 'Society', 'Cultural']",82.84489755170871,"['Emotion/10.543223443223445', 'Culture/9.534065934065936', 'Spirituality/6.49047619047619']","['Emotion', 'Culture', 'Spirituality']",26.567765567765573,1.0,0.0

Mathilde Rosier,"Rosier’s body of films, gleam with that indeterminate in-between glow of twilight. Things hardly move at all in her films. They are, quite simply, often without plot, without spoken voice and without narrative elements. Such is the case of Far from Honolulu (2003), a film exploring the plight of intuition and emotion inside the idea of the sea journey. In the film, a pensive and reflective man is depicted playing guitar at sea as well as from inside a boat looking outward. Airy and divine-like, he is shown sleeping, in a trance state, staring out to the ocean, waiting for the journey to pass, progress, in order to arrive somewhere, but where? There is mention of Recife, Brazil, but one gets the sense that figure and place is almost other-worldly or mythic. This is further highlighted by the repetitious sound of the ocean’s waves. The ending of the film is quite arbitrary, expressing a clear desire to not illustrate an end or a narrative, but another kind of vacant agency close to immediacy and the present.","Mathilde Rosier’s oeuvre arguably skirts the line between real and fiction. Not in the sense of plausible but fake alternative histories or but rather, hers are theatrical renderings in film, performance, painting or sculpture. The cultivation of illusion and ambiguity, as a counter to the concrete veracity of factual things, is one of Mathilde Rosier’s persistent concerns. The artworks that result seem decidedly uncontemporary; without attempting to be nostalgic per se, they appear out of our time or quaint. Pastel-colored watercolors of birds attached to hats, melodic musical scores, videos permeated with the haze of twilight: the artist would tell you that her art sits at the limit of the “acceptable,” as it is at times too charmingly pretty and too apparently inoffensive to fit in an art world that often privileges other qualities. But behind the apparent naivety of her fantastical world is a force that deceives or, indeed, that makes deception the very thread that binds her work together.

Philip-Lorca diCorcia,,"The works of Philip-Lorca diCorcia oscillate between two possible definitions of photography – from a recording system in the tradition of documentary and a system of representation in the tradition of fiction. The use of different contradictory light sources in the same picture is symptomatic of his staging of reality. In Napoli 1996 a man walking down the street in broad daylight is fictionalized by the flash of the camera. Related to the world of cinema in the case of  “Hollywood” (1990-1992), fashion in the series “W” (1997-2000), and advertising, the photographer questions the representation of reality, between the utopia of transparency and necessary construction. “I try to criticize the beast I work with. This monster of whom I share my bed with is about me,” the artist says. His photographs are a space alien in the world of the viewer because of the absorbance of characters. In “Mario” (1978), a man leaning in front of a refrigerator is estranged to the outside world, far from the viewer, denying his/her presence. Immobility is also a constant in the artist’s work. Psychological tension and dramatical equilibrium structure his photographs like enigmas or like “moments suspended in narratives that unfold,” as critic Peter Galassi suggests.Phillip-Lorca diCorcia was born in 1951 in Hartford, Connecticut, USA.","Brent Booth; 21 Years Old; Des Moines, Iowa; $30",Americas,[],"['photography.n.01', 'tension.n.01', 'drama.n.04', 'narrative.n.01', 'portrait.n.02', 'record.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_Brent-Booth_WEB.png,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_Brent-Booth_WEB-300x197.png,https://kadist.org/work/brent-booth-iowa/,"['Cultural/6.31490937682888', 'Individual_Personal/2.6333333333333333', 'Material_Physical/0.8571428571428571']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Material_Physical']",9.805385567305072,"['Arts/2.725146198830409', 'Fantasy/1.9090909090909092', 'Identity/1.8333333333333335']","['Arts', 'Fantasy', 'Identity']",6.467570441254653,[],[],0.0,[],[],0.0,,
Thomas Demand,"Ecke (Angolo/Corner) is a clear example of Thomas Demand’s conscious use of ambiguity. The scene depicted is a corner in what appears to be an office space, perhaps abandoned after some kind of natural disaster or neglected in the midst of a fast-paced presidential campaign. Documents, folders, and scraps of paper are scattered over a couple of shelves and on top of a desk, with an office chair and a printer visible in the edge of the composition’s frame. The generic is here rendered both unspectacular and uncanny.  The incertitude of the scene is augmented by the lack of text in all the folders and documents. This strategy—together with a lack of any human figures and use of flat and un-textured surfaces—is consistently used by Demand as a way to break with the illusion and leave the viewer clues that reveal the true nature of his paper and cardboard constructions.","A scene from the news, a moment captured in a magazine, a postcard or a film… For German artist Thomas Demand it all begins with an image. After he identifies an imagethat spikes his interest, he painstakingly replicates elements of it—often architectural spaces or ubiquitous objects in the background—in life-sized models made frommaterials such as paper and cardboard. He then photographs the models and subsequently destroys them, making the photographs the last remaining trace.     Demand was originally trained as a sculptor and initially used photography solely as a means to document his work, but in the early nineties his focus shifted towards the photographic image, in part due to his interest in the philosophical nuances inherent in capturing ‘the truth.’     While some of his photographs depict seemingly ordinary spaces and objects, others depict locations imbued with certain history and social and political meanings—such assites that relate to the attacks perpetrated by the far-left militant organization Baader-Meinhof (a.k.a. Red Army Faction) in the 70s, Saddam Hussein’s hideout during the 2003 Iraq invasion, and even the Oval Office in the White House. This ambiguity places the viewer in a dilemma where the images are often seem reminiscent of a scene previously viewed. The result is a lingering mystery: have we seen this before?     This interplay between fiction and reality is an essential part of Demand’s work; drawing from the ordinary and the eerily familiar to invite the viewer to reflect on the mediated truth and constructed experience we are subject to through the saturation of mass media.",Ecke (Angolo/Corner),Europe,"['document.n.01', 'paper.n.01', 'scene.n.01', 'illusion.n.01', 'edge.n.01', 'picture.v.02', 'construction.n.01', 'natural.a.01', 'frame.n.01', 'composition.n.01', 'nature.n.01', 'human.a.01', 'figure.n.01', 'spectator.n.01', 'space.n.01']","['everyday.s.01', 'preternatural.s.01', 'ordinary.n.02', 'delusion.n.03', 'replica.n.01', 'photography.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_Thomas-Demand-Ecke.png,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_Thomas-Demand-Ecke-300x221.png,https://kadist.org/work/ecke-angolocorner/,"['Cultural/5.201453388372893', 'Material_Physical/1.0', 'Politics/0.7777777777777778']","['Cultural', 'Material_Physical', 'Politics']",6.9792311661506705,"['Arts/2.7708978328173375', 'Design/1.5555555555555556', 'Time/1.0']","['Arts', 'Design', 'Time']",5.326453388372893,"['Cultural/12.9157150039503', 'Material_Physical/9.901343101343102', 'Individual_Personal/4.088888888888889']","['Cultural', 'Material_Physical', 'Individual_Personal']",26.90594699418229,"['Arts/6.3705379587732525', 'Land/3.164835164835165', 'Language/2.307692307692308']","['Arts', 'Land', 'Language']",11.843065431300726,0.6666666666666666,0.3333333333333333
Elina Brotherus,,"Elina Brotherus depicts, through her photographic work a portrait of the contemporary artist made during different artistic residencies. Frequently in her work, she is the main model. In the series of “Suites françaises”  (French suites) made during a residency of three months at the Musée Nicéphore Niepce at Chalon-sur-Saône in 1999, the artist questions her relation to a foreign language, showing the difficulty in naming things with “post it” stickies. From this work emerges a sense of autobiographical intimacy, of which the camera exists as an absent witness. The artist captures decisive emotional states: the skin texture of a dancer in rehersal, a fine arts model posing as a Degas nude, a state of mind before leaving…The theme of landscape links introspection and contemplation as revealed in her self-portaits. One thinks of Caspar David Friedrich who stressed in his paintings that art played a role as mediator between nature and man. When referring to her work  Brotherus has stated, “For me, photography is primarily a constructed image. I consider myself a “maker” of images, or perhaps as someone who finds images.

Michael Linares,"After two years of research in close conversation with anthropologists and archaeologists, Linares eventually enrolled in classes to study archeology—specifically the history of material artifacts. He became obsessed with the origin of metaphor, and the stick as the Ur (earliest) object used by humans that led to the formation of meaning itself. This video, which accompanies the “Museum of the Stick,” is part of major work surveying material culture collected and presented by the artist through a complex narrative of associations and anthropological research. Here “aleatory” means not just random but subject to the complex and organic forces of chance.  “As early as the Pliocene epoch, the stick as a specific, three-dimensional form has played a vital role in the technological, social, political, aesthetic, and religious development of humanity and some animal species. The chimpanzee’s tool that catches termites, the facial ornamentation of the Yanomami people, the Shulgi of Ur’s weaponry—as well as the toothpick, knitting needle, and vaulting-pole—all represent a minute slice of the myriad transfigurations that this form has undergone throughout history.”","Michael Linares (San Juan, Puerto Rico) asks critical questions about the most fundamental forms and concepts of art.  His recent work has combined physical comedy with formal abstraction, scholarly research and quotidian material culture.

Miljohn Ruperto,"Miljohn Ruperto’s high-definition video Janus takes its name from the two-faced Roman god of duality and transitions, of beginnings and endings, gates and doorways.He is usually depicted with two faces as he looks both forward and backward, to the future and the past. The video, which is deftly animated in collaboration with Aimée de Jongh, presents a close-up of a dying “duck-rabbit,” a vivified version of an ambiguous illustration made popular by the Austrian-British philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein in his Philosophical Investigations.  One’s attention shifts between seeing a duck and a rabbit, prompted by the animal’s movements and sounds. Its red eyes, wounded body, and belabored breathing suggest the end of life. Just as it appears to take its last breath, however, it inhales again, teetering on the precipice. As the video continues its unceasing loop, a resolution is withheld. In this way, Ruperto makes a connection between the ambiguity of visual perception and the paradox of life and death as embodied by this fragile animal in its final moments.","Based in Los Angeles, Miljohn Ruperto is a cross-disciplinary artist working across photography, cinema, performance, and digital animation. His work refers to historical and anecdotal occurrences, and speculates on the nature of assumed facts and the construction of truth. Often involving replicas, modified versions, and enactments—including Chinese-made reproductions of Caspar David Friedrich’s ‘The Monk by the Sea;’ modified images based on the 15th century Voynich Manuscript; or reworked footage of Filipino actress Isabel Rosario Cooper—Ruperto takes cultural and historical references and untethers them from their original context to challenge our perception and generate something altogether new. Ruperto’s work is often informed by his collaborations with experts from other disciplines including Dutch animator Aimée de Jongh, neuroscientist and engineer Rajan Bhattacharyya, photographer Ulrik Heltoft among others. Through a richness and diversity of lenses, and preferencing the obscure, mysterious and the magical, his work challenges fixed conceptions of truth and history, and instead speaks of an indeterminacy and subjectivity of experience that renders truth and fiction near indistinguishable.",Janus,Americas,"['video.n.01', 'probe.n.01', 'shift.n.01', 'concluding.s.01', 'life.n.01', 'version.n.01', 'picture.v.02', 'collaboration.n.01', 'percept.n.01', 'passage.n.01', 'connection.n.01', 'animal.n.01', 'eyes.n.01', 'red.s.01', 'future.n.01', 'popular.a.01', 'attention.n.01', 'death.n.01', 'inspire.v.01', 'sound.n.01', 'moment.n.01', 'motion.n.03', 'ocular.a.02', 'body.n.01']","['dichotomy.n.01', 'life.n.01', 'death.n.01', 'percept.n.01', 'paradox.n.01', 'fragility.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/mruperto_janus_2013_still_01.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/mruperto_janus_2013_still_01-300x169.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/janus/,"['Cultural/8.421245421245422', 'Individual_Personal/6.062271062271062', 'Material_Physical/5.842490842490842']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Material_Physical']",20.326007326007325,"['Materiality/3.293040293040293', 'Fantasy/3.257142857142857', 'Body/2.8333333333333335']","['Materiality', 'Fantasy', 'Body']",9.383516483516484,"['Material_Physical/26.50266153694947', 'Individual_Personal/16.135703512174107', 'Society/12.22363223292016']","['Material_Physical', 'Individual_Personal', 'Society']",54.86199728204374,"['Time/8.758114271349566', 'Space/7.146153846153846', 'Body/6.426093514328808']","['Time', 'Space', 'Body']",22.33036163183222,0.6666666666666666,0.3333333333333333
Mimian Hsu Chen,"In Hsu’s work, Colonia China (2014), the artist documents a Chinese cemetery of Costa Rica’s Limón Province, along the country’s Caribbean coast. Serving as the final resting place for Chinese migrants who came to Coast Rica during the late nineteenth century as indentured laborers working to construct the Transatlantic Railroad, the Colonia China speaks to a long but divided history.

Minerva Cuevas,"During her research on primitive currencies and cultural cannibalism, Cuevas came across the Donald Duck comic book issue “The Stone Money Mystery,” where Donald goes on a quest to find missing museum objects. Cuevas’s America (2006) is a wall painting of a comic Donald Duck wallowing in a heap of gold coins, alluding to Mexico’s postrevolutionary mural tradition. The mural’s background is one of the earliest illustrations of flora and fauna in the American continent, juxtaposed with a reference to America as having bountiful natural resources available to be exploited, and the historical use of comics as ideological tools. The piece also recalls the politics of the Mexican muralists Diego Rivera, David Alfaro Siqueiros, and José Clemente Orozco filtered through contemporary narratives of identity, otherness, and power. Driven first by multiculturalism in the United States, then by globalization worldwide, this Disney reference also refers to the notorious book How to Read Donald Duck: Imperialist Ideology in the Disney Comic, originally published during the Chilean revolution as Para Leer al Pato Donald before it was banned and burned. Writing from exile in 1975, the authors signed the preface to the English edition as follows: “Mr. Disney, we are returning your Duck. Feathers plucked and well-roasted. Look inside, you can see the handwriting on the wall, our hands still writing on the wall: Donald, Go Home!”","Minerva Cuevas’s socially engaged practice encompasses a range of strategies and mediums, including film, installation, performance, and site-specific public intervention. Cuevas aims to provide insight into the complex economic and political structures of the social realm, offering playful possibilities for their subversion. Often manifesting as small but poignant interruptions into the everyday realm, Cuevas’s modest acts infiltrate and disrupt economic and social systems, drawing attention to the aesthetics of popular imagery such as corporate branding, political symbols and slogans, and even comic books.",America,Americas,"['united_states.n.01', 'book.n.01', 'mention.n.01', 'wall.n.01', 'money.n.01', 'read.v.01', 'mexico.n.01', 'print.v.01', 'hands.n.01', 'writer.n.01', 'tool.n.01', 'rock.n.01', 'politics.n.01', 'issue.n.01', 'background.n.01', 'american.a.01', 'natural.a.01', 'tradition.n.01', 'museum.n.01', 'historical.a.01', 'identity.n.01', 'contemporary.s.01', 'power.n.01', 'cultural.a.01', 'piece.n.01']","['capitalism.n.01', 'neoliberalism.n.01', 'exploitation.n.01', 'inequality.n.01', 'imperialism.n.02', 'power.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/image_minerva_cuevas_america.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/image_minerva_cuevas_america-300x183.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/america/,"['Politics/13.73910599204717', 'Society/8.89656862745098', 'Individual_Personal/3.2']","['Politics', 'Society', 'Individual_Personal']",25.83567461949815,"['Politics/7.594117647058823', 'Economy/6.273039215686274', 'Power/3.3116550116550116']","['Politics', 'Economy', 'Power']",17.17881187440011,"['Individual_Personal/28.54926184926186', 'Cultural/19.08528428093646', 'Material_Physical/18.570535312640583']","['Individual_Personal', 'Cultural', 'Material_Physical']",66.2050814428389,"['Mind/9.54871794871795', 'Culture/8.53846153846154', 'Identity/6.597979797979797']","['Mind', 'Culture', 'Identity']",24.685159285159287,0.3333333333333333,0.0

Motoyuki Daifu,"Seven family members and a cat all squeezed into the small five-room house, where Motoyuki Daifu grew up in Yokohama. This young photographer’s Family Project series documents the chaos of his family’s home life. Viewers of Daifu’s color photographs peer into the cramped, cluttered, and intimate world of their living quarters, what would normally be hidden from outsiders. The setting of dirty dinner plates and empty take-out food containers becomes an elegant still life series inhabited by what appear to be dozing inebriants. The artist turns what might initially appear as an offensive lifestyle into a light-hearted and stunning look at domestic life in contemporary Japan. The artist has described the private world by saying, “My mother sleeps every day. My dad does chores. My brothers fight. There are trash bags all over the place. Half-eaten dinners, cat poop, mountains of clothes: this is my lovable daily life, and a loveable Japan.”","Motoyuki Daifu is a representative of the youngest generation of Japanese photographers, who like the more senior Nobuyoshi Araki, use the snapshot as a way to represent his life. Daifu’s photographs appear to be full of humor, as he uses the clutter to his advantage, packing as much color as he can into each frame. The artist started to take photography seriously when he was nineteen. At that time, he enrolled in art school to study the subject, and gravitated toward photographing those things that were around his daily experience. Recently he has become interested in and influenced by contemporary art rather than straightforward photography.

Nalini Malani,"Malani draws upon her personal experience of the violent legacy of colonialism and de-colonization in India in this personal narrative that was shown as a colossal six channel video installation at dOCUMENTA (13), but is here adapted to single channel. The video is largely silent until violent crashes and female voices overwhelm the viewer, portraying the inner voice of a woman who is brutally gang raped. Malani addresses the fatal place of women in Indian society and the geo-politics of national identity. She brings the poetry of Pakistani revolutionary Faiz Ahmed Faiz into conversation with Samuel Beckett, Heiner Muller and Mahashweta Devi.","Nalini Malani is a leading contemporary artist from India whose work looks critically at issues of gender, race, geopolitics, and the impact of consumer culture amidst rampant globalization. Working across painting, drawing, installation, animation, video and theater, Malani’s practice is characterized by its political bite, and, as described by the artist, for having an ‘internationalist’ perspective of global issues. Malani came to prominence in the 1980s through pioneering work that brought Feminist issues to the fore, courageously addressing the fatal place of women in Indian society. Highlight the violent legacy of colonialism has been a central concern, especially due to how she experienced it firsthand as a child and refugee during the partition of India. Formally, her work has borrowed imagery from Hindu as well as Greek mythology, and is characterized by a distinct combination of abstraction and figuration.

Stan Douglas,"Michigan Central Station is part of a larger photographic series, Detroit Photos, which includes images of houses, theaters, stadiums, offices, and other municipal structures. Continuing his fascination with failed modernist utopias, Douglas depicts Michigan Central Station as a monolithic, almost prison-like structure lording over a desolate landscape. Once the hub of industrial transportation, the station is now devoid of any human activity and lies fallow, surrounded by train-less tracks and vegetation-less ground.

Nathaniel Dorsky,"Dorsky’s pieces included in the Kadist Collection are small still photographs from twelve of his most important films. Here, the still images function in the same way as his cinematographic work: Highly aesthetic, they allow for the appearance of intricate visual patterns and layers of meaning that take scenes of everyday life as its source material. Both Dorsky’s cinematic and photographic works follow a stream of consciousness that rejects representation or fixed narrative structure. Intended as transparent, direct objects to be experienced, these intimate and quiet works encourage contemplation.","Nathaniel Dorsky belongs to a younger generation of filmmakers that follows key  figures of the Bay Area avant-garde scene, like Bruce Conner, and is mainly associated with Canyon Cinema.

Bjorn Copeland,"Sign #1, Sign #2, Sign #3 were included in “Found Object Assembly”, Copeland’s 2009 solo show at Jack Hanley Gallery, San Francisco. These rather austere collages were created by simply cutting and inverting the text from existing information signs. In Sign #2, for example, the original image that presumably carried the message “NO RIDERS” was placed upside down. By cutting out some of the syllables and inverting and rearranging them, the message was rendered unreadable. By maintaining the overall integrity of the signs and their most legible visual characteristics (luminescent color, bold font, size and rectangular format), Copeland’s collages obscure language in favor of a “delirious optical disorientation.”","Bjorn Copeland (along with his brother Eric) is an original member of Black Dice, an experimental/noise band associated with the thriving musical movement around the Rhode Island School of Design (RISD) in the late 1990s. Not surprisingly, Copeland’s visual practice is connected to that music scene, most obviously in his use of psychedelic designs associated with concert flyers which deploy hypnotic, almost acid-driven pop referents in a certain “op” manner. In many of his recent assemblages and collages, Copeland reuses discarded products, accumulated and found debris, as well as product packaging. As with his music, he rearranges and re-composes these preexisting structures, building complicated and intricate abstract patterns that aim to disorient and play with the viewer’s perception.","Sign series, #1, #2, #3",Americas,"['sign.n.01', 'message.n.01', 'feature.n.01', 'format.n.01', 'collage.n.01', 'original.s.01', 'language.n.01', 'color.n.01', 'ocular.a.02', 'make.v.03', 'object.n.01', 'image.n.01']","['street_sign.n.01', 'disorient.v.01', 'language.n.01', 'text.n.01', 'cut.v.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/bjorn_copeland_sign_1.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/bjorn_copeland_sign_1-300x225.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/sign-series-123/,['Cultural/7.0537240537240535'],['Cultural'],7.0537240537240535,"['Language/4.746031746031746', 'Arts/1.5384615384615385', 'Culture/0.7692307692307693']","['Language', 'Arts', 'Culture']",7.0537240537240535,"['Cultural/9.173743086978382', 'Individual_Personal/7.287612696900623', 'Material_Physical/3.547619047619048']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Material_Physical']",20.00897483149805,"['Mind/3.995604395604396', 'Materiality/2.6904761904761907', 'Culture/2.307692307692308']","['Mind', 'Materiality', 'Culture']",8.993772893772896,0.5,0.3333333333333333

Bruce Conner,"Unlike many of his earlier films which often present poignant critiques of mass media and its deleterious effects on American culture, EASTER MORNING, Conner’s final video work before his death in 2008, constitutes a far more meditative filmic essay in which a limited amount of images turn into compelling, almost hypnotic visual experience. The video presents us with a reinterpretation of footage from his unreleased avant-garde film, Easter Morning Raga, from 1966. In contrast to his more famous pieces like A Movie (1958) and Crossroads (1976) which are juxtapositions of fragments from newsreels, soft-core pornography, and B movies, the images in EASTER MORNING serve as a reinterpretation of footage. Here the artist expands the images in duration, gauge, and frame rate, which results in an enigmatic visual transcendence, or “imagelessness,” and distances the viewers from their preconceptions of what they are watching. Accompanied by rhythmical music, the collision of images in EASTER MORNING is not only testament to Conner’s ability to balance order and chaos, control and chance, but further reveals his abiding interest in alternative ways of seeing and experiencing.","Bruce Conner was undoubtedly one of the key figures of America’s avant-garde art scene since his work emerged in the late 1950s.

Judy Chicago,"Domes #1 represents a significant moment in Chicago’s career when her art began to change from a New York-influenced Abstract Expressionist style to one that reflected the pop-inflected art being made in Los Angeles. By 1968, the year she began creating Domes, the twenty-nine-year-old artist had moved from Chicago to Los Angeles, graduated from UCLA, and was part of a generation of artists whose work was characterized by of the masculine overtones of Southern California’s flourishing car culture. Inspired by new technologies in the auto manufacturing, these “Finish Fetish” artists appropriated industrial materials such as car paint or lacquer to create artwork with pristine finishes. Chicago too was interested in using industrial technologies and enrolled in auto body and boat building school. While the geometric forms, meticulously applied finish, and luminous, gradated hues of color in Domes speak to Chicago’s interest in the prevailing artistic themes of 1960s Southern California, its intimate scale, round shape, and triangular formation belie her career-long interest in using “feminine” forms to promote feminist issues.","In the 1970s Judy Chicago and Miriam Schapiro founded the Feminist Art Program at CSU Fresno, which later moved to CalArts in Los Angeles. As a result of her art work and pedagogy, Chicago is the most recognizable feminist artist who gave an authentic voice to women’s experiences and their important contributions to human society and culture. In addition to expanding women’s rights to encompass a greater freedom of artistic expression, Chicago expanded the definition of art and the role of all artists. Her earliest forays into the art world coincided with the rise of Minimalism, and the Los Angeles-based Finish Fetish movement, which she eventually abandoned in favor of an art practice believed to have greater content and relevance.","Domes, #1",Americas,"['los_angeles.n.01', 'california.n.01', 'technology.n.01', 'artist.n.01', 'geometric.s.01', 'change.v.01', 'school.n.01', 'coevals.n.01', 'abstraction.n.01', 'form.n.01', 'paint.n.01', 'scale.n.01', 'issue.n.01', 'inspire.v.01', 'artwork.n.01', 'color.n.01', 'building.n.01', 'shape.n.01', 'moment.n.01', 'subject.n.01', 'manner.n.01', 'culture.n.01', 'make.v.03', 'material.n.01', 'body.n.01']","['femininity.n.01', 'fabrication.n.04', 'polish.n.02', 'closeness.n.01', 'hue.n.01', 'feminism.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/judy_chicago_domes.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/judy_chicago_domes-300x267.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/domes-1/,"['Individual_Personal/9.124903038138333', 'Cultural/2.42483660130719', 'Society/1.0']","['Individual_Personal', 'Cultural', 'Society']",12.549739639445523,"['Emotion/2.6263736263736264', 'Mind/2.423529411764706', 'Spirituality/1.6']","['Emotion', 'Mind', 'Spirituality']",6.649903038138332,"['Individual_Personal/20.11749084249085', 'Material_Physical/18.45982905982907', 'Cultural/17.093090406325704']","['Individual_Personal', 'Material_Physical', 'Cultural']",55.670410308645614,"['Mind/6.488644688644689', 'Space/6.346153846153846', 'Arts/6.1324066456419395']","['Mind', 'Space', 'Arts']",18.967205180440473,0.6666666666666666,0.3333333333333333
Tammy Rae Carland,"Carland’s series of large-format photographs Lesbian Beds (2002) depicts beds that have been recently vacated. Shot from directly above, they are lavish views of very private spaces. The artist plays to her viewers’ voyeuristic impulses, inviting us to look, but then denying us the opportunity to study the figures to whom the sheets belong, so that the rumpled covers become like anthropomorphic stand-ins inviting empathic projection.","Using photography, text, and video, Tammy Rae Carland tactically realigns traditional ideas of love, partnership, domesticity, and family. Her work consistently subverts heteronormative conceptions of gender and sexuality; positive representations function simultaneously as portrait and protest.

Tao Hui,"For 7 Materials, Tao Hui films seven scenes selected from the countless scenarios in his notebooks, including a group of ethnic minority girls in a spoil pit in the rain, a reporter interviewing a corpse, and a deity sailing on the river. Due to the lack of internal logical order, these one-minute video “materials” are not played in a fixed sequence but randomly. For Tao Hui, to film his diary is to adorn and embellish his memories before evoking and reviving their spirits. For 1 Character, Tao Hui performs yet another act of necromancy. An audio recording revels the identity of the missing subject: the character is a dead woman, middle-aged, with a coarse voice and an accent.  Escaping the routine of country life, she realizes that she is unable to abandon the internal experiences of home after coming to the city and suffers the pains of its deception in utter solitude. The sense of displacement that the artist stresses is not only a result of visual and audio montage or in the audio narrative, but also a product of the identity loss and cultural crisis in China.","Tao Hui indeed believes that fairy tales can ease people’s intensive mind. Working with various mediums including graphic arts, painting, video, objects and installation, Tao Hui uses technological procedures and elements from Chinese tradition to question the tenets of globalization, virtual relationships and hegemonic thinking. Through his works, he hopes to force viewer to confront their own cultural history and system of belief.",1 Character & 7 Materials,Asia,"['identity.n.01', 'fictional_character.n.01', 'material.n.01', 'river.n.01', 'loss.n.01', 'china.n.01', 'sequence.n.01', 'voice.n.01', 'collage.n.01', 'narrative.s.01', 'state.n.04', 'consequence.n.01', 'woman.n.01', 'sense.n.01', 'memory.n.01', 'subject.n.01', 'cultural.a.01', 'city.n.01', 'ocular.a.02', 'experience.n.01', 'scene.n.01', 'movie.n.01', 'life.n.01', 'video.n.01']","['narrative.s.01', 'identity.n.02', 'culture.n.01', 'dystopia.n.02', 'loss.n.02', 'globalization.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_NO1-WEB.png,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_NO1-WEB-300x128.png,https://kadist.org/work/1-character-7-materials/,"['Cultural/5.27892156862745', 'Society/1.9090909090909092', 'Individual_Personal/1.6985294117647058']","['Cultural', 'Society', 'Individual_Personal']",8.886541889483066,"['Fantasy/5.27892156862745', 'Economy/1.0', 'Community/0.9090909090909091']","['Fantasy', 'Economy', 'Community']",7.18801247771836,"['Cultural/20.776851253321848', 'Material_Physical/18.91020152877738', 'Individual_Personal/17.04343204095526']","['Cultural', 'Material_Physical', 'Individual_Personal']",56.73048482305449,"['Land/10.15241194993517', 'Urbanization/6.893614881850176', 'Media/5.89508547008547']","['Land', 'Urbanization', 'Media']",22.941112301870817,0.6666666666666666,0.0

Her photographs are sculptural constructions that are photographed, printed, tiled, and re-photographed; images taken from darkroom manuals that are deconstructed using a scanner; and stock photographs that are collaged by hand and then re-photographed.","Cwyner is both related to a photo conceptual tradition of photography from Vancouver as well as to a new school of photography working with digital manipulation, scanners, stock photography and the notion of photography after image making, both of which are represented in the Kadist collection via artists such as Arabella Campbell, Ron Terada, Tim Lee, Rodney Graham, Ian Wallace from Vancouver and artists such as Chris Wiley, Lucas Blalock, Erin Shirreff or John Houck, who recently have explored the idea of photography beyond image making.",432 Photographs of Nefertiti,Americas,"['photograph.n.01', 'mind.n.01', 'ad.n.01', 'magazine.n.01', 'scheme.n.01', 'consciousness.n.01', 'print.v.01', 'image.n.01', 'sculptural.a.01', 'design.n.01', 'studio.n.01', 'popular.a.01', 'set.n.01', 'collage.n.01', 'construction.n.01', 'hand.n.01', 'ocular.a.02', 'object.n.01', 'time.n.01']","['handling.n.02', 'collage.n.01', 'digital.a.02', 'photography.n.01', 'deconstruct.v.01', 'image.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_432-Photographs-of-Nefertiti-WEB.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_432-Photographs-of-Nefertiti-WEB-248x300.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/432-photographs-of-nefertiti/,"['Cultural/10.770684157603663', 'Individual_Personal/4.094852515905147', 'Material_Physical/1.7142857142857142']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Material_Physical']",16.579822387794525,"['Arts/2.7708978328173375', 'Mind/2.3956043956043955', 'Culture/2.307692307692308']","['Arts', 'Mind', 'Culture']",7.474194536114041,"['Cultural/34.33583870325694', 'Individual_Personal/13.61178656225096', 'Material_Physical/5.052747252747253']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Material_Physical']",53.000372518255155,"['Arts/11.923366013071895', 'Media/8.75786364478315', 'Mind/8.734760664172429']","['Arts', 'Media', 'Mind']",29.415990322027476,1.0,0.6666666666666666
Marcelo Cidade,"450 Hayes Street (excavation site) by Marcelo Cidade is a large scale photograph documenting the artist’s excavation of a parking lot located at 450 Hayes Street in San Francisco, a former section of the city’s Central freeway and current condominium site. The cut shape mirrors the precise shape of the Kadist gallery floor, where the concrete was relocated as part of his residency exhibition entitled Somewhere, Elsewhere, Anywhere, Nowhere. Through this concrete graft, Cidade inextricably links the city with artwork. His installation observes while it also inscribes an entropic building situation within this specific place in the city, and simultaneously, any place in any city.","Marcelo Cidade is an artist of situations, if not a Situationist of a new age, as he drifts through city streets around the world creating actions, interventions, films, photographs or drawings.

Erin Shirreff,"Erin Shirreff’s A.P. series of prints investigates how objects are “constructed” at the level of the image. For each composite photograph, Shirreff fabricates two sculptural forms from what appear to be metal or plaster, although the precise materials are unidentified. Her sculptures resemble miniature architectural models or renderings of buildings as-yet-to-be fully conceptualized, both elemental and elegant in their use of sharp angles and clean lines. Shirreff then photographs each object against a similarly monochromatic backdrop in her studio, printing each image in rich and high-contrast greyscale. Next, she folds each print in half vertically so that the objects depicted in the image appear to be bisected. Finally, she adjoins the two folded prints at the edge of the fold, creating a new pictorial form from the two bisected images. The hybridized forms depicted in her prints resemble a jarring juxtaposition of geometric sturdiness and malleable plasticity, a cross between Tony Smith’s monolithic minimalism and Alexander Calder’s surreal wiriness. Shirreff uses photography here to imagine sculptural forms that do not exist in real life, and her work employs an illusionistic quality indebted to artistic traditions of trompe l’oeil. But Shirreff also reveals the artifice behind these images, suggesting that all pictorial representations are constructed and, in effect, can never fully document or replicate the experience of encountering an object in “real” perceptual space.","Erin Shirreff creates composite images that interrogate presumed boundaries between artifice and documentary. Originally trained as a sculptor, she works in the expanded field of photography, video, and sculpture, and her practice frequently employs multiple fine arts disciplines at once. Her work reconsiders the limits of sculptural practice by showing how image-based media can effectively be used to render hybridized shapes that do not (and arguably cannot) exist in real life. At the same time, she also reveals how these images are always deliberately constructed, leaving fold lines exposed and obvious discontinuities and aberrances in her composites. In leaving these artificial traces behind, Shirreff’s reminds us that images are always fabricated on some level and that representation itself is an artifice at its core.",A.P.

Donna Conlon and Jonathan Harker,"In Tapitapultas (2012), Donna Conlon and Jonathan Harker comment on mass consumerism and pollution by way of a game they invented. The artists used disposable spoons as catapults to shoot thousands of plastic bottle caps at a hole in a concrete platform. The platform was once part of a U.S. military installation in the Panama Canal Zone, and it is now an observation deck in a nature park. As the video comes to an end, the viewer discovers that the bottle caps that fell through the hole accumulated on the forest floor, forming a giant mountain of synthetic waste in the natural landscape.","Donna Conlon and Jonathan Harker, who also exhibit individually, have been making work together since 2006, often using a playful approach to address serious sociopolitical themes. Conlon has a background in science and sculpture, and Harker’s is in film and media studies. Their videos merge Conlon’s use of ordinary objects and investigations of human behavior with Harker’s irony and subversion of conventional storytelling methods. Their playful and poetic critiques of contemporary culture frequently use discarded objects to comment on consumption, accumulation, climate, and the ironic beauty of waste-ridden landscapes.

Marcelo Cidade,"Adição por subtração 4 (Addition by Subtraction, 2010) is an intervention into the white cube with both beautiful and intimidating results. The installation is a large rectangular frame created out of shards of clear and colored glass that protrude from the wall. The use of glass fragments is reminiscent of Robert Smithson’s sculpture Map of Glass (Atlantis) (1969), yet the concerns here are very different. The work delineates an interior space and draws the viewer’s attention through the use of aggressive materials, yet there is empty space where we would expect an artwork to be.

Jiang Zhi,"In the video installation Tremble, Jiang projected the life-size images of seven naked men and women onto seven individual screens. Each person displays a different facial expression and body position such as reading a book, arms open for a hug, holding a knife, raising a fist to take an oath. Each gesture reflects some essential social aspect of everyday life: hugging is about caring, taking oath has to do with politics, reading relates to acquiring knowledge, and raising a knife indicates violence. As a result of a hidden vibration machine, the images’ projection screens oscillate vigorously and the contradiction between the shaking screens and the static human figures creates an absurd effect. Through this imposed trembling, Jiang suggests the invisible power that controls modern human behavior. These seemly “out-of-control” actions are often ironically conceived as the most adaptable and mutually-agreed upon tenets of social activity.","Jiang Zhi represents a generation of artists whose practice developed against the backdrop of experimental art in China in the 1990s, during which a series of social and cultural transformation occurred in the country. His work actively deals with issues such as body, gender, identity, consumerism, conflict, fear, power, and temporality, and often involves recent social events. Jiang attended the China Academy of Art and has long been engaged with writing and video art.

Yet, as the players shuffle the ball around, recklessly knocking down items in the apartment, the viewer begins to wonder if the indoor game marks the increase of air pollution, and the erasure of green space by real estate development has forced all leisure activity to be conducted in the prison of one’s apartment under surveillance.","Zhang Qing is a conceptual artist living and working in Shanghai after graduating from the Changzhou Institute of Technology. Zhang’s works deploy a variety of motifs and styles, at times dabbling in gender-bending photography and engaging in endurance-performances. Particularly, Zhang uses humor as an access point to expose the darker sides of capitalism in works such as Don’t Go So Fast (2009), social commentary on the state of economic disparity among social classes. His recent video installation and mixed media works has developed a sophisticated videographic language, exemplified by CCTV(2011) to address issues of state media, surveillance and privacy. Zhang considers China’s socio-political challenges to be unique to its own cultural-historical background and do not always translate or transfer well into foreign contexts. Thus, contemporary Chinese art can provide special visual entries into these complex socio-economic situations.",603 Football Field,Asia,"['apartment.n.01', 'game.n.01', 'surveillance.n.01', 'prison.n.01', 'field.n.01', 'represent.v.01', 'private.a.01', 'activity.n.01', 'space.n.01', 'development.n.01', 'urban.a.01', 'real.a.01', 'camera.n.01', 'spectator.n.01']","['athletic_game.n.01', 'urbanization.n.02', 'surveillance.n.01', 'claustrophobia.n.01', 'youth_culture.n.01', 'recklessness.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/qing_zhang_football_field.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/qing_zhang_football_field-300x155.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/603-football-field/,"['Politics/4.266666666666667', 'Cultural/4.25771744595274', 'Society/4.1959595959595966']","['Politics', 'Cultural', 'Society']",12.720343708579003,"['Media/2.534640522875817', 'Politics/1.8', 'Culture/1.7230769230769232']","['Media', 'Politics', 'Culture']",6.05771744595274,"['Society/24.887620875856175', 'Cultural/23.875457875457883', 'Politics/14.859340659340663']","['Society', 'Cultural', 'Politics']",63.622419410654715,"['Arts/8.883516483516484', 'Spirituality/7.551648351648351', 'History/5.737815126050419']","['Arts', 'Spirituality', 'History']",22.172979961215255,1.0,0.0
Wibowo Woto aka Wok the Rock,"Vertical Horizon addresses a media scandal in 2010 that took over the cultural milieu of Indonesia. Someone uploaded on a sextape of pop star Ariel Peterpan with model-actress Luna Maya recorded on a mobile phone. Several days later, another video of Ariel Peterpan and Cut Tari, an infotainment news presenter in Indonesia, surfaced on the Internet. This second video taken using a mobile phone in vertical frame but transferred to a computer in default horizontal format. Vertical Horizon zones in on the way viewers unconsciously turn their head horizontally to watch the sensational videos to examine the way mobile phones have changed our lives.

Li Ran,"In his video work Beyond Geography, Li dramatizes the role of the artist-as-imitator to the point of sheer parody. Dressed to toe in the costume of a typical Discovery Channel adventurer-explorer, the artist dashes suavely through the uncharted jungle habitat of a primitive tribe. Li modulates his own voice in laughably accurate mimicry of the dubbed Discovery Channel protagonist familiar to Chinese viewership, daringly gulping fresh water from a river, expertly admiring exotic vegetation, and whimpering in fear of the dark sounds of the night (screaming, even, as he trips on a human skull) in an full-scale exaggeration of a nature show personality. None of these settings, however, is shot on “location” as the video takes place entirely in an empty 3-D digital film studio with a blue screen. Engaging in a near Brechtian conceit, Li deliberately keeps the studio space raw in order to remind us that these television programs are always deliberately artificial and produced. His project is entirely farcical, and just as there are not sets or props to lure the viewer into complacency, Li’s interactions with the indigenous tribesmen – whom Li “discovers” – becomes their own simulated performance of colonial appropriation and meetings of “first contact.” This narrative of appropriation carries throughout until, near the video’s end, Li (in full explorer persona) begins to make declarations about the tribe’s civilization, decreeing their cave paintings (never seen on camera) as masterpieces on par with Picasso and Mondrian. In assuming the guise of the pedantic academic, Li ends his video with a humorously condescending twist. At the same time, his video reminds us of the inherent dangers of confusing mediated representation with documentary while reminding us of the constant threat of cultural appropriation at play when we fail to see the blue screen for the the jungle and the artist for the explorer.","Li Ran produces video, installation, and performance-based works that examine various states of parody and simulacra in the digital world. Through performative narrative, reproduction, mimicry, and satire, Li Ran’s work straddles the line between fact and fiction in playful explorations of the meaning and making of truth. Li’s describes his own artwork with the language of architecture: that if an artwork is a like room, its meaning should be open and porous, not forced against a unilateral interpretation. This virtual-minded analogy is fitting inasmuch as Li’s practice increasingly hinges on the exploration of the non-reality within reality. Born in the Hubei province, his work has been exhibited extensively at international venues such as the Jewish Museum, New York; Contemporary Arts Museum Houston (CAMH), Houston; Musée d’art contemporain de Montréal, Montreal; The Museum of Moscow, Moscow; Institute of Contemporary Arts (ICA), London; Centre d’Art Contemporain Genève, Geneva; and CCA Wattis Institute for Contemporary Arts, San Francisco.",Beyond Geography,Asia,"['studio.n.01', 'screen.n.01', 'video.n.01', 'river.n.01', 'television.n.01', 'chinese.a.01', 'shoot.v.01', 'fear.n.01', 'plan.n.01', 'setting.n.01', 'supporter.n.01', 'familiar.a.01', 'night.n.01', 'documentary.a.01', 'changeless.s.02', 'water.n.01', 'location.n.01', 'voice.n.01', 'play.n.01', 'set.n.01', 'sound.n.01', 'function.n.03', 'representation.n.01', 'nature.n.01', 'performance.n.01']","['medium.n.01', 'appropriation.n.03', 'colonialism.n.01', 'parody.n.01', 'fabrication.n.01', 'documentary.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/li_ran_beyond_geography.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/li_ran_beyond_geography-300x200.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/beyond-geography/,"['Cultural/23.170381742440576', 'Society/6.528796349848981', 'Politics/1.7092731829573933']","['Cultural', 'Society', 'Politics']",31.40845127524695,"['Media/7.63970588235294', 'Arts/4.300883430295195', 'Technology/3.3025641025641033']","['Media', 'Arts', 'Technology']",15.24315341521224,"['Individual_Personal/34.080586080586095', 'Cultural/20.030122818358116', 'Material_Physical/15.070818070818074']","['Individual_Personal', 'Cultural', 'Material_Physical']",69.18152696976229,"['Emotion/10.543223443223445', 'Mind/6.774358974358974', 'Values/6.421978021978022']","['Emotion', 'Mind', 'Values']",23.739560439560442,0.3333333333333333,0.0
Adriano Costa,"Westminster Agua Viva is made from Westminster City Council(‘s) recycling bin bags, glued together, that the artist has painted and cut or cut and painted. Although, they hang on the wall they possess a strong sculptural quality as the fringes float away from the wall. This is part of a series of works that refer to Brazilian concrete and neo-concrete art as well as Arte Povera in a playful manner while demonstrating a strong identity of its own. Through this work Costa highlights the many recycling stages of these bin bags suggesting the multiple uses that recycled materials can be put to. The exhibition in which the works were displayed was entitled ‘Touch me I am geometrically sensitive’ (Sadie Coles HQ, London, 2014), inviting the viewer to engage physically with the works and debunking the preciousness of art and its inflated values.

Etel Adnan,"Adnan’s paintings are simple images with bold contrasting colors and rich textures. This particular work has an iconic feel and a strong physical presence in spite of its diminutive size. All of her paintings are small but, like Howard Hodgkin’s work, their intensity gains from their diminutive size. However small they are, they are large in scale and impact. This painting may recall the sunset in Beirut just as it refers to a small confined but defined mass within a larger sea, perhaps in itself some kind of political statement. It is stark in its contrasts but rich in color. The central pattern of horizontal bands may recall national flags, however without referring to any one in particular. Unlike Albers’s work, there is no sense of gradation of color nor forms increasing or decreasing in size but, like Albers, Adnan is manifestly interested in the way in which one color may influence and impact another. A tension between the expansive and the restricted and between the horizontal and the vertical make this a very satisfying and dynamic image.","Etel Adnan was born on February 24,1925 in Beirut. Lebanese American artist and writer, she presently lives and works in Paris. Since the 1960s, Etel Adnan has been making accordion-fold books, or leporellos, that meld visual and verbal observation, fusing the artist’s parallel practices in painting and writing as she transcribes poems and records unfolding landscapes and urban spaces.",Untitled (Beirut),Middle East & Africa,"['remember.v.01', 'color.n.01', 'statement.n.01', 'sea.n.01', 'flag.n.01', 'strong.a.01', 'national.a.01', 'mass.n.01', 'form.n.03', 'iconic.a.01', 'impact.n.01', 'contrast.n.01', 'colors.n.01', 'tension.n.01', 'scale.n.01', 'physical.a.01', 'simple.a.01', 'presence.n.01', 'cardinal.s.01', 'image.n.01', 'sense.n.01', 'political.a.01', 'form.n.01']","['tension.n.03', 'abstraction.n.04', 'color.n.01', 'horizontal.n.01', 'bayrut.n.01', 'vertical.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/adnan_137-untitled_beirut_2010_oil_on_canvas_24x30cm.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/adnan_137-untitled_beirut_2010_oil_on_canvas_24x30cm-300x200.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/untitled-beirut/,"['Cultural/3.4960440316477466', 'Material_Physical/2.7333333333333334', 'Society/1.8']","['Cultural', 'Material_Physical', 'Society']",8.02937736498108,"['Arts/3.4960440316477466', 'Materiality/1.8333333333333335', 'Urbanization/1.8']","['Arts', 'Materiality', 'Urbanization']",7.12937736498108,"['Cultural/12.507620320855617', 'Material_Physical/11.18864468864469', 'Individual_Personal/7.288644688644688']","['Cultural', 'Material_Physical', 'Individual_Personal']",30.984909698144996,"['Materiality/6.293040293040293', 'Fantasy/4.175757575757576', 'Mind/3.195604395604396']","['Materiality', 'Fantasy', 'Mind']",13.664402264402263,0.6666666666666666,0.3333333333333333
El Hadji Sy,"El Hadji Sy is an important figure in the critical movement that followed Lépold Sedar Senghor´s Négritude ideology. Senghor supported El Hadji’s work from the start and continued to follow it, but they came together again in another cultural policy initiative, inaugurated by Senghor: the famous Villages des Arts. The village is a co-operative for artists in Dakar where each one has a professional studio. It is one of the city’s major tourist attractions but is also a space that maintains its environment as a working and creative venue for local and visiting international artists.  Born in Senegal in 1954, El Hadji Sy (El Sy) studied fine arts at the Ecole Nationale des Beaux-Arts in Dakar. A widely exhibited artist and curator, he works contemporary Senegalese art, both in Africa and Europe; including an Anthology of Senegalese Contemporary Art, co-edited with Friedrich Axt and a collection of works for the Museum für Völkerkunde, Frankfurt am Main, in 1989. He was President of the Association of Visual Arts of Senegal (ANAPS) in Dakar for several years, and has organized a number of exhibitions and initiatives, including the Village des Arts and the Laboratoire Agit-Art. The latter is an artist collective founded in 1974 in Dakar, Senegal, aimed at agitating existing institutional frameworks, to question the tenets of Leopold Sedar Sengor’s Négritude and to encourage artists to adopt critical approaches toward their practices. At that time, Dakar was a place where political consciousness was actively articulated, and artist collectives like Laboratoire Agit-Art went beyond aesthetic experience to critically promote the development of cultural and artistic endeavors.  In September 1994 El Hadji Sy hosted “Tenq/Articulations”, the first workshop of the Triangle Network to be held in Senegal. In 2015, a retrospective of his work was held at the Weltkulturen Museum, Frankfurt.","Born in Senegal in 1954, El Hadji Sy (El Sy) studied fine arts at the Ecole Nationale des Beaux-Arts in Dakar.Lives and works in Dakar (Senegal).",No.13 Esprit de l’Univers,Middle East & Africa,"['keep.v.01', 'critical.a.01', 'artist.n.01', 'museum.n.01', 'cultural.a.01', 'europe.n.01', 'form.v.01', 'consciousness.n.01', 'bear.v.01', 'network.n.01', 'creative.a.01', 'association.n.01', 'development.n.01', 'africa.n.01', 'aesthetic.a.01', 'local.a.01', 'celebrated.s.01', 'model.n.01', 'approach.n.01', 'studio.n.01', 'environment.n.01', 'contemporary.s.01', 'motion.n.03', 'practice.n.01', 'city.n.01']","['abstraction.n.01', 'universe.n.01', 'metaphysics.n.01', 'aeriform.s.02', 'mark.n.04', 'religious.s.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/elhadjisy_1_low.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/elhadjisy_1_low-300x260.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/untitled-44/,"['Material_Physical/10.371794871794874', 'Cultural/8.164327485380117', 'Individual_Personal/6.869987468671678']","['Material_Physical', 'Cultural', 'Individual_Personal']",25.406109825846666,"['Space/6.679487179487179', 'Arts/4.930994152046783', 'Values/3.375']","['Space', 'Arts', 'Values']",14.985481331533961,"['Society/25.882110210051394', 'Individual_Personal/14.88753860518567', 'Politics/12.362438052143936']","['Society', 'Individual_Personal', 'Politics']",53.132086867381,"['Geopolitics/5.026143790849673', 'Spirituality/4.795604395604396', 'Culture/4.66547619047619']","['Geopolitics', 'Spirituality', 'Culture']",14.48722437693026,0.3333333333333333,0.0

Taus Makhacheva,"For Taus Makhacheva, the wild, untamed side of human nature is often the foundation of many of her formal investigations. A leading voice of the younger generation based in Moscow, Makhacheva works with sculpture and installation while her preferred medium remains video. Her Dagestani (Northern Caucasian) roots draw her to this rugged land as her site of choice for many of her works. She digs into the cultural shifts and changes that overwhelmed this land during a state of post-soviet disorientation. While turning to a lost past, the sense of nostalgia in her work is often overcome by an urgency to invent new traditions and rituals. Tackling head on issues of assimilation, morphing customs and gender politics, her performances and video installations reveal a strong sense of human dignity and pride.  A seminal work in her long line of investigations of the Dagestani identity, the three-channel video installation Let me be part of a narrative looks at the all-male dog fighting championship set up alongside a Soviet documentary of Ali Aliev, the five-time world wrestling champion from Dagestan. Seemingly disparate at first, both games expose a need to diffuse aggression, revealing a strict code of play and conduct such as ‘not showing teeth’ or ‘not hiding the tail’. The training of the Caucasian sheep dogs based on raising them to stand up to wolves, a strong force of nature they must face within themselves. For the dog breeders, the fight becomes a form of self-validation and assertion within the group. A girl breeder expands the narrative with her own search for respect, arguing that the winning characteristics are carried through the maternal line.","Taus Makhacheva’s performance and video works critically examine what happens when different cultures, traditions come into contact with one another. If her work cannot be restricted to one medium or conceptual gesture – flowing between media work, sculpture and performance – a playful sense of irony and satire characterise her approach to art making. Having grown up in Moscow with cultural origins in the Caucasus region of Dagestan and having studied in the UK, her artistic practice is informed by these personal connections with the co-existing worlds of pre and post Sovietisation and a consciousness of the specificities of the art world. Tightrope (2015), her internationally praised video presented at the 2017 Venice Biennale, featured a tightrope walker carrying 61 copies of work from the collection of the Dagestan Museum of Fine Art across a precipitous Caucasus ravine, commenting on the dangers of cultural amnesia and the fragile state of local artistic institutions. By setting up her works in the dry landscape of Dagestan and evoking regional tales and traumas, the artist softly touches upon larger issues of power, memory and cultural transitions, continuously questioning through irony her own legitimacy and capacity to address political questions.",Let Me Be Part of a Narrative,Europe,"['probe.n.01', 'strong.a.01', 'land.n.01', 'narrative.s.01', 'establish.v.08', 'nature.n.01', 'sense.n.01', 'human.a.01', 'video.n.01', 'white.n.01', 'documentary.n.01', 'pull.v.01', 'shift.n.01', 'lose.v.01', 'coevals.n.01', 'head.n.01', 'feature.n.01', 'put.v.01', 'installation.n.01', 'formal.a.01', 'politics.n.01', 'voice.n.01', 'game.n.01', 'play.n.01', 'issue.n.01']","['sex.n.04', 'dignity.n.01', 'fight.n.02', 'soviet.a.01', 'game.n.01', 'culture.n.06']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/3_taus_makhacheva_let_me_be_part_of_a_narrative.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/3_taus_makhacheva_let_me_be_part_of_a_narrative-300x169.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/let-me-be-part-narrative/,"['Individual_Personal/13.132234432234435', 'Society/9.216849816849816', 'Cultural/7.595604395604395']","['Individual_Personal', 'Society', 'Cultural']",29.944688644688647,"['Emotion/6.217948717948718', 'Spirituality/3.257142857142857', 'Power/2.6654761904761903']","['Emotion', 'Spirituality', 'Power']",12.140567765567766,"['Individual_Personal/19.89809667456727', 'Cultural/17.99666020254256', 'Material_Physical/13.030941607412199']","['Individual_Personal', 'Cultural', 'Material_Physical']",50.92569848452203,"['Mind/7.19788838612368', 'Culture/6.528937728937729', 'Media/5.049622926093514']","['Mind', 'Culture', 'Media']",18.776449041154926,0.6666666666666666,0.0
Jean-Luc Moulène,,"After training in literature and working in advertising, Jean-Luc Moulène became known in the 1990s for his ‘documentary’ photographic practice. His images could be considered as studies of natural and cultural phenomena; the Objets de grève ( Strike objects) series (1999) documents objects made in factories during social protests. Moulène uses the codes of media images and diverts them to liberate the gaze and produce a new imaginary. This poetic tactic is manifest in the series called Disjonctions, in which Moulène photographs still lives, portraits, daily urban scenes. The notion of disjunction, which can be interpreted in the grammatical sense (‘or’, ‘either… either…’) or in terms of logic (an alternative in a dilemma), is manifest in the image by the disunity of the elements in the composition. The artist is not just a photographer, he increasingly creates relations with drawing, sculpture, objects, texts and newspapers. As a counterpoint, when asked what unites his work, the artist responds that: “An absurd evidence, a horrible revelation,a burst of laughter…” (Interview with Briony Fer, « Chaque quelconque », ibidem.) His works tend towards evocation rather than fixed meaning, inviting the spectators to invent their own tales in this “community of storytellers and translators” (Jacques Rancière, The Emancipated Spectator).","La Vigie (extrait 6), Paris 2004-2011",Europe,[],"['culture.n.01', 'object.n.01', 'industry.n.01', 'politics.n.01', 'everyday.s.01', 'urban.a.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/jlm_la_vigie_ext_6.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/jlm_la_vigie_ext_6-300x100.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/la-vigie-extrait/,"['Society/2.909090909090909', 'Material_Physical/2.0', 'Politics/1.0']","['Society', 'Material_Physical', 'Politics']",5.909090909090909,"['Politics/1.0', 'Economy/1.0', 'Urbanization/1.0']","['Politics', 'Economy', 'Urbanization']",3.0,[],[],0.0,[],[],0.0,,
Adriana Lara,"Lara uses things readily at hand to create objects and situations that interrogate the processes of art and the spectrum of roles that art and artists play in society. To these ends, she has used furniture, projections, photographs, clothing, and even people as her materials. A reflection on how the production of meaning itself takes place in the manufacturing of things is embodied in wooden hand chairs, a crafty Indonesian version of the iconic Pedro Friedeberg 1960s Pop design. Facing one another and pulling a tight thread between their fingers as if playing a game, The Thinkers (2014) is a magnified version of the practice of weaving, with the hand as the primary technological tool. Part readymade, part joke, and part examination of the role of the artist, the significance of this simple gesture hinges on the feeling of discontinuity, the shift in consciousness, that it provokes.","Adriana Lara is fascinated by how a single thing (an object, a photograph, a song, a text) can be transformed into a work of art. This process does not relate to formal alteration or the application of expert skill, but rather to a simple act of articulation. Rather than relying on the physical creation of something new, this becomes that (namely, art) because the artist declares it to be so. This special kind of alchemy imbues all of Lara’s objects with a restless ambiguity. Much like her art, Lara is something of a shape-shifter herself, moving between the roles of artist, curator, musician, or writer whenever it suits her needs.",The Thinkers,Americas,"['hand.n.01', 'version.n.01', 'function.n.03', 'wooden.s.01', 'consciousness.n.01', 'shift.n.01', 'tool.n.01', 'projection.n.01', 'iconic.a.01', 'design.n.01', 'production.n.01', 'game.n.01', 'contemplation.n.02', 'simple.a.01', 'situation.n.01', 'gesture.n.01', 'society.n.01', 'artist.n.01', 'practice.n.01', 'procedure.n.01', 'people.n.01', 'make.v.03', 'material.n.01', 'object.n.01', 'photograph.n.01']","['wit.n.01', 'object.n.01', 'meaning.n.01', 'knockoff.n.01', 'handmade.a.01', 'alchemy.n.02']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/img_adriana_lara_the_thinkers_web.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/img_adriana_lara_the_thinkers_web-200x300.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/the-thinkers/,"['Cultural/4.8540849673202615', 'Individual_Personal/1.8', 'Material_Physical/1.0']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Material_Physical']",7.654084967320261,"['Emotion/1.8', 'Fantasy/1.6', 'Design/1.5555555555555556']","['Emotion', 'Fantasy', 'Design']",4.955555555555556,"['Cultural/40.225343713733814', 'Society/36.14059337635189', 'Politics/24.30918803418804']","['Cultural', 'Society', 'Politics']",100.67512512427375,"['Arts/12.836014149249445', 'Spirituality/10.540659340659342', 'Economy/8.141966530201826']","['Arts', 'Spirituality', 'Economy']",31.518640020110617,0.3333333333333333,0.0

Amalia Pica,"Memorial for intersections #2 (2013) is a minimalist, black metallic structure that contains the brightly colored translucent circles, triangles, rectangles, and squares that originally were presented in Pica’s performance work A ? B ? C (2013). When read as A intersection B intersection C, this piece references the fact that, during the last dictatorship in Argentina (1976–83), the military junta forbade Venn diagrams, and the related concept of intersection, from being taught in elementary schools, because they were viewed as potentially subversive. In A ? B ? C, Pica invited performers to manipulate translucent, colored Perspex shapes, producing new configurations that used the idea of intersection to reimagine collaboration and community.  This work enacts the very role that its title suggests, asking how a performance can become a sculpture. The structure transforms the original human performative gestures into cold, stylized frames that indeed memorialize something that was once living. If most memorials are monuments—that is, embedded in rich substrata of symbolic references—then Memorials for intersections are delicate and literal tributes to the truisms of math. Borrowing from minimalist and constructivist traditions, the memorials are simple, almost sophomoric, in the directness of their shapes and colors. While fixed in place, the transparent geometric panels hanging on the frame shift in tone throughout the day, responding to changes in light and reverberating with the live actions that led to their conception.","Amalia Pica describes herself as an outsider, in the sense that she is an Argentine artist living and working in an art world that is still largely dominated by the same nations that colonized the globe centuries ago. But Pica is not the kind of outsider who stands by sullenly and criticizes; she’s more like the quirky character spouting wit and wisdom from the peripheries of the stage. Her works often engage with the idea of being out of place and out of time—staging the aftermath of a celebration rather than the party itself, for example—all the while maintaining an attitude of bemused observation.",Memorial for intersection #2,Unspecified,"['concept.n.01', 'frame.n.01', 'structure.n.01', 'shape.n.01', 'performance.n.01', 'geometric.s.01', 'tone.n.01', 'shift.n.01', 'school.n.01', 'collaboration.n.01', 'military.a.01', 'day.n.01', 'see.v.05', 'symbolic.a.01', 'colors.n.01', 'simple.a.01', 'community.n.01', 'original.s.01', 'gesture.n.01', 'tradition.n.01', 'function.n.03', 'action.n.01', 'light.n.01', 'idea.n.01', 'black.a.01']","['intersection.n.01', 'revolutionist.n.01', 'dictatorship.n.01', 'freedom.n.01', 'community.n.01', 'diagram.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/hs9-ap4205s_a.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/hs9-ap4205s_a-300x225.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/memorial-intersection-2/,"['Cultural/5.3050653594771235', 'Society/3.4615384615384617', 'Politics/2.569230769230769']","['Cultural', 'Society', 'Politics']",11.335834590246355,"['Design/1.8888888888888888', 'Politics/1.7692307692307692', 'Urbanization/1.6923076923076925']","['Design', 'Politics', 'Urbanization']",5.350427350427351,"['Individual_Personal/35.48403361344538', 'Cultural/34.035459311929905', 'Society/17.434743344031276']","['Individual_Personal', 'Cultural', 'Society']",86.95423626940656,"['Values/11.808058608058609', 'Mind/11.72820512820513', 'Culture/10.384615384615385']","['Values', 'Mind', 'Culture']",33.92087912087912,0.6666666666666666,0.0
Hank Willis Thomas,"Bread and Roses takes its name from a phrase famously used on picket signs and immortalized by the poet James Oppenheim in 1911. “Bread for all, and Roses, too’—a slogan of the women in the West,” is Oppenheim’s opening line, alluding to the workers’ goal for wages and conditions that would allow them to do more than simply survive. Thomas’ painting includes several black, white, brown, yellow, and red raised fists—clenched and high in the air in the internationally recognized symbol of solidarity, resistance, and unity.","Employing the visual language and terminology of mass media, and appropriating symbols and images from popular culture, Hank Willis Thomas’ work seeks to question and subvert established definitions and positions with regards to personal identity and the narrative of race. Working across installation, photography, video, and media work, Thomas maintains his photo conceptualist roots, primarily taking source material from found photographs and archives. These images form the basis from which the artist seeks to uncover the fallacies that history claims as truth. His work illustrates how the way history is represented and consumed reinforces generalizations surrounding identity, gender, race and ethnicity, and that as an artist he has an opportunity to expose or to revise those histories from the points of view of the oppressed.",Bread and Roses,Americas,"['west.n.01', 'phrase.n.01', 'black.a.01 white.a.01', 'worker.n.01', 'resistance.n.01', 'sign.n.01', 'symbol.n.01', 'woman.n.01', 'black.a.01', 'white.a.01']","['resistance.n.01', 'solidarity.n.01', 'activism.n.01', 'equality.n.01', 'race.n.01', 'justice.n.01', 'integrity.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_Hank-Willis-Thomas_Bread-and-Roses-WEB.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_Hank-Willis-Thomas_Bread-and-Roses-WEB-300x300.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/bread-and-roses/,"['Individual_Personal/6.671428571428571', 'Politics/3.0', 'Cultural/2.3162393162393164']","['Individual_Personal', 'Politics', 'Cultural']",11.987667887667888,"['Values/4.271428571428571', 'Activism/2.0', 'Spirituality/1.6']","['Values', 'Activism', 'Spirituality']",7.871428571428572,"['Material_Physical/6.464835164835164', 'Society/3.171794871794872', 'Individual_Personal/2.4263736263736266']","['Material_Physical', 'Society', 'Individual_Personal']",12.063003663003663,"['Land/4.038461538461539', 'Urbanization/1.6025641025641026', 'Power/1.0']","['Land', 'Urbanization', 'Power']",6.641025641025642,0.3333333333333333,0.0

Mary Reid Kelley,"Kelley’s 2015 portrait of the poet Charles Baudelaire is one of a series of poets, rappers, and other thinkers who have influenced the artist’s ideas about beauty, creativity, and expression.  As a challenging artist who marches to her own drum, Mary Reid Kelley is in the vanguard of a generation that blends the digital and the analog to dialogue with history. From 2009 to the present, she has made videos that fuse live performance, animation, drawing, sculpture, and digital design. Her characters—a nurse, a prostitute, a bohemian, Ariadne, and the Minotaur—confront the limits of their situations in droll verse. Blending Homer and Cindy Sherman by way of Virginia Woolf, Reid Kelley tells finely wrought narrative epics, rife with wordplay and art historical references. She situates her work in World War I, nineteenth-century Paris, or classical antiquity. Working with archival sources and a range of collaborators, often Patrick Kelley, her husband and an accomplished artist, Reid Kelley invents a poetic hybrid of mediums. By creating or manipulating different aspects of language, performance, and mise-en-scène, she rethinks the potential of the inauthentic to heighten our awareness of the real.","As a challenging artist who marches to her own drum, Mary Reid Kelley is in the vanguard of a generation that blends the digital and the analog to dialogue with history.

Andrew Norman Wilson,"Chase ATM emitting blue smoke, Bank of America ATM emitting red smoke, TD Bank ATM emitting green smoke was shot in the American Southwest at Mid-century modern architectural structures that were built to house regional independent banks and have since been bought up by Chase, Bank of America, and TD Bank. The video utilizes transparency and opacity effects in multimedia software to question the perceptibility of finance. It offers a complex metaphor (toxic assets, emergency flares, house/mortgage on fire) about the financial sector and the effects of the ‘crisis’ that led to the disappearance (and the ghostly memory) of many local and regional banks.","After studying journalism and communications, where he discovered “fields of affective imagery, authentic falsification, and psychic property ownership,” Wilson worked on a series of revealing documentary projects while employed at Google. His subsequent work, following an MFA at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, is immersed in researching, critiquing and caricaturing features of corporate systems, often employing the same digital mechanisms and materials produced by these entities to parody their culture of malfeasance.","Chase ATM emitting blue smoke, Bank of America ATM emitting red smoke, TD Bank ATM emitting green smoke",Americas,"['effects.n.01', 'united_states.n.01', 'shoot.v.01', 'architectural.a.01', 'local.a.01', 'complex.a.01', 'red.s.01', 'modern.a.01', 'metaphor.n.01', 'house.n.01', 'american.a.01', 'structure.n.01', 'construct.v.01', 'memory.n.01', 'video.n.01']","['finance.n.01', 'banks.n.01', 'crisis.n.01', 'review.n.02', 'corporate.a.01', 'capitalism.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_PNI.ANW002-web.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_PNI.ANW002-web-300x208.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/chase-atm-emitting-blue-smoke-bank-of-america-atm-emitting-red-smoke-td-bank-atm-emitting-green-smoke/,"['Society/6.995321637426901', 'Cultural/2.4615384615384617', 'Material_Physical/0.782608695652174']","['Society', 'Cultural', 'Material_Physical']",10.239468794617537,"['Economy/6.995321637426901', 'Arts/1.5384615384615385', 'Culture/0.9230769230769231']","['Economy', 'Arts', 'Culture']",9.456860098965363,"['Cultural/16.336533074768376', 'Society/6.670726495726496', 'Material_Physical/6.2334361544887855']","['Cultural', 'Society', 'Material_Physical']",29.240695724983656,"['Arts/7.459609997845291', 'Land/3.5429599640125957', 'Urbanization/2.575854700854701']","['Arts', 'Land', 'Urbanization']",13.578424662712589,1.0,0.3333333333333333
Elad Lassry,"In his composition, Chocolate Bars, Eggs, Milk, Lassry’s subjects are mirrored in their surroundings (both figuratively, through the chocolate colored backdrop and the brown frame; and literally, in the milky white, polished surface of the table), as the artist plays with color, shape, and the conventions of representational art both within and outside of the photographic tradition.  Elad Lassry explores how visual languages are constructed across multiple disciplines and media. His larger body of work responds to the relationship between artistic mediums and their forms, and his prints question familiar modes of viewership and our continuous desire to find and identify clear narratives in photographs. Lassry utilizes both found photographs and original compositions in his work, a juxtaposition that challenges notions of authorship and attribution. By emphasizing how photographic images are deliberately staged and constructed, Lassry destabilizes notions that photographs depict and document “the real.” In foregrounding the image as object, he also suggest that the photograph only provides a referent for a presence that “has-been” but that no longer exists in the current moment. Born in Israel, Lassry earned his BFA in film from the California Institute of Arts in 2003 and his MFA from the University of Southern California in 2007.","Elad Lassry explores how visual languages are constructed across multiple disciplines and media.

Park Chan-Kyong,"Park Chan-Kyong’s film Citizen’s Forest draws on two works for which the artist has a particular fondness: The Lemures, an incomplete painting by Korean artist Oh Yoon, and Colossal Roots, a poem by Korean poet Kim Soo-Young. The Lemures (1984) is a panoramic sketch depicting a procession of victims from major events in modern Korean history, including the Donghak Peasant Revolution, the Korean War, and the Gwangju Uprising. Colossal Roots (1974) is an intellectual text taking into account the multiple layers of unconditional acceptance of traditions while subverting the Orientalist perspective. Citizen’s Forest serves as a contemporary platform conjuring the interests shared by these works with regard to historical trauma and ‘Asian Gothic’ imagination. Formally derived from shan-shui (landscape) painting mounted on scrolls or from haunted houses in amusement parks, this work invites the audience to walk along a dark corridor while ghosts of the forest appear as video and sound. Without having the ghosts act out dramatic situations, the work testifies to a certain “ghostness” through the conventional actions performed by characters. The ghosts or citizens in Citizen’s Forest, whether a metaphorical allusion to history or tradition, act as if they are fully aware of the contemporary apathy to their existence.","Artist and filmmaker Park Chan-kyong was born in Seoul under the reign of Park Chung-hee, whose authoritarian rule transformed South Korea from an impoverished, war-torn country into what the artist describes as a ‘militaristic, repressive, modern state.’ The shadows of Japanese occupation and the Korean War loomed large over the period, driving the call for nationalism and productivity. Park Chan-Kyong’s works quietly resist that drive—they recall the lives that modernization too often ignores. Most of Park Chan-Kyong’s multimedia installations—which incorporate an array of found footage, photography, and vintage cinema—are slow and understated, almost abstract works. But a closer look reveals a shrewd take on Cold War politics and the formation of modern Korea. Rather than using the dramatic power of film to restage the past, Park finds meaning in voids and absences. With a sly use of text and montage, Park resuscitates stories that have been repressed or hidden from the official accounts, reminding us how present they still are.",Citizen’s Forest,Asia,"['ghost.n.01', 'tradition.n.01', 'contemporary.s.01', 'being.n.01', 'perform.v.01', 'injury.n.01', 'conventional.a.01', 'history.n.01', 'imagination.n.01', 'multiple.a.01', 'audience.n.01', 'layer.n.01', 'modern.a.01', 'house.n.01', 'situation.n.01', 'sound.n.01', 'event.n.01', 'war.n.01', 'action.n.01', 'historical.a.01', 'position.n.03', 'fictional_character.n.01', 'landscape.n.01', 'movie.n.01', 'video.n.01']","['ghost.n.03', 'history.n.01', 'marginalize.v.01', 'oppressive.s.02', 'south_korea.n.01', 'past.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_PCK_Citizens-Forest_04-WEB.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_PCK_Citizens-Forest_04-WEB-300x200.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/citizens-forest/,"['Material_Physical/8.617862838915471', 'Society/2.686868686868687', 'Individual_Personal/1.9230769230769231']","['Material_Physical', 'Society', 'Individual_Personal']",13.227808448861081,"['Time/5.197979797979798', 'Land/2.6198830409356724', 'Spirituality/1.9230769230769231']","['Time', 'Land', 'Spirituality']",9.740939761992394,"['Cultural/36.93454356101415', 'Individual_Personal/28.93173360866861', 'Society/26.43109961933492']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Society']",92.29737678901768,"['Fantasy/9.373529411764705', 'Arts/8.371697909933204', 'Mind/8.288084464555054']","['Fantasy', 'Arts', 'Mind']",26.033311786252966,0.6666666666666666,0.0
Zhu Jia,"In this four-channel 10 min video installation different episodes play simultaneously on the four screens. The artist has arranged several different scenarios and symbolic props which make it easy for viewers to feel the pervasive ambiguity which cannot be put into words. On the one hand, our imagination is tempted by the delicate details, but on the other hand, our imagination is limited through a very rigorous structure. The gradual increasing sound of the violin – musicians pulling repeatedly with A in C major tortures the audience’s visual and hearing senses. A man with a hand full of colorful balloons, moves his arm rhythmically up and down. A young girl sits, smiling, on the mattress covered by flowers. The shadows of a flying flag reflect on the wall. Through a language full of hints, the artist wants to express critical attitude towards control.","Pioneer of video art in China, Zhu Jia’s works have often dealt with ‘realness’ and everyday life, though often in unconventional ways. One of his most famous pieces, 1994’s Forever, saw him fix a camera onto the wheel of a Forever tricycle and pedal it around the streets of Beijing. The resulting video is a disorientating, constantly spinning and almost nausea-inducing tour of the city. Both Forever and 2002’s Never Take Off, which features a plane infinitely taxiing along a runway, have established Zhu as a pioneer of video art in China, together with Zhang Peili. Despite their leading roles in China’s video art scene, both were classically trained at two of the country’s most prominent art academies, Zhang in Hangzhou and Zhu in Beijing.",Colorful Balloons,Asia,"['hand.n.01', 'imagination.n.01', 'episode.n.01', 'control.n.01', 'flag.n.01', 'critical.a.01', 'shadow.n.01', 'details.n.01', 'audience.n.01', 'viewing_audience.n.01', 'symbolic.a.01', 'screen.n.01', 'language.n.01', 'sound.n.01', 'structure.n.01', 'sense.n.01', 'wall.n.01', 'ocular.a.02', 'video.n.01']","['symbolism.n.01', 'semiotics.n.01', 'phantasmagoric.s.01', 'control.n.01', 'dreamlike.s.01', 'equivocal.a.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_1.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_1-300x169.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/colorful-balloons/,"['Cultural/3.888888888888889', 'Politics/3.603749191984486', 'Individual_Personal/2.712418300653595']","['Cultural', 'Politics', 'Individual_Personal']",10.205056381526969,"['Power/2.78021978021978', 'Fantasy/2.0', 'Mind/1.8888888888888888']","['Power', 'Fantasy', 'Mind']",6.6691086691086685,"['Cultural/15.073687423687428', 'Society/10.4974358974359', 'Individual_Personal/6.012271062271062']","['Cultural', 'Society', 'Individual_Personal']",31.58339438339439,"['Arts/5.6553113553113565', 'Power/3.5494505494505497', 'Urbanization/3.2615384615384615']","['Arts', 'Power', 'Urbanization']",12.466300366300366,0.6666666666666666,0.3333333333333333
Glenn Ligon,"Glenn Ligon’s diptych, Condition Report is comprised of two side-by-side prints. Though simple, each contains a nested stack of historical and self-referential quotations. Both black-and-white prints depict a version of Ligon’s 1988 painting, Untitled (I Am A Man), which declares the words of the parenthetical in blocky black letters. Ligon’s painting, of course, is itself a reappropriation and, in some ways, a reproduction. Based on the simple, declarative protest signs carried by sanitation workers in Memphis, Tennessee during the height of the Civil Rights Movement, Ligon’s painting recontextualized this now-iconic object as a work of art.  While the print on the left of Condition Report directly mirrors Ligon’s 1988 painting, the print on the right of the pair includes marks, scribbles, and hand-written notations around the edges and borders of the image. These additions to the work are the condition report notes of the title, and refer back to the 1988 original—though this time not as it existed as a symbol of a historical event, but as it exists in the present as a rarified art object. Tracing a simple phrase—I AM A MAN—through these iterations as declaration, symbol, object, and surface, Ligon levies questions of representation and race, commodification and history, and the value and preciousness of one’s identity.","American artist Glenn Ligon is well known for his conceptually based works in paint, neon, photography, sculpture, and video. He draws upon American history, literature, and other sources to create works centered on the black American experience. Ligon filters through cultural sources to create compositions that highlight social inequalities, commemorate struggles, and point fingers at hypocrisy. Rendered in neon, through paint, and in other media, Ligon often draws out the words of others—be they the sanitation workers who protested in Memphis, Tennessee, with signs declaring I AM A MAN; or the controversial and confrontational Richard Pryor, whose jokes become electric letters on Ligon’s canvases.",Condition Report,Americas,"['print.n.01', 'symbol.n.01', 'simple.a.01', 'historical.a.01', 'object.n.01', 'race.n.01', 'protest.n.01', 'note.n.01', 'edge.n.01', 'pair.n.01', 'version.n.01', 'worker.n.01', 'boundary_line.n.01', 'sign.n.01', 'event.n.01', 'surface.n.01', 'representation.n.01', 'establish.v.08', 'identity.n.01', 'black.a.01', 'motion.n.03', 'question.n.01', 'title.n.01', 'history.n.01', 'time.n.01']","['appropriation.n.03', 'meaning.n.01', 'civil_right.n.01', 'language.n.01', 'commodity.n.01', 'history.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_Glenn-Ligon_Condition-Report_web.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_Glenn-Ligon_Condition-Report_web-300x208.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/condition-report/,"['Cultural/12.302442002442007', 'Society/6.030769230769231', 'Material_Physical/2.5424242424242425']","['Cultural', 'Society', 'Material_Physical']",20.87563547563548,"['Arts/3.228937728937729', 'Economy/2.6923076923076925', 'Language/2.658119658119658']","['Arts', 'Economy', 'Language']",8.579365079365079,"['Individual_Personal/17.833877233877242', 'Cultural/17.059141348847234', 'Politics/13.502614379084973']","['Individual_Personal', 'Cultural', 'Politics']",48.395632961809454,"['Geopolitics/6.827614379084967', 'Time/6.009731934731935', 'Identity/5.567210567210568']","['Geopolitics', 'Time', 'Identity']",18.404556881027467,0.3333333333333333,0.0
Cameron Rowland,"Rowland’s minimal installations require a focus not on the objects themselves, but on the conditions of their creation, use, and distribution.

In Constituent, this question is made somewhat more literal: a dangling electrical plate hangs limply from the wall, the copper wires jutting from the wall cut to reveal their core.

Tim Lee,"Tim Lee’s two-channel video installation Party for Your Right to Fight, Public Enemy, 1988 (2006) combines the strategies of two very different artists: Bruce Nauman and Public Enemy. The side-by-side monitors (which are disorientingly out of sync) play a video of a close-up of Lee’s head reciting Public Enemy lyrics. In a further spin, Lee’s head is upside down and revolving—counterclockwise on one screen and clockwise on the other—like a pair of malfunctioning record turntables. In this, Lee is referencing Bruce Nauman’s multichannel installation Anthro-Socio (1992), which features a man’s head rotating as he calls out commands to the viewer. By resampling and conflating the works of these two artists, Lee momentarily conjoins conceptual video art and radical hip-hop, leading the viewer to search (perhaps in vain, perhaps not) for similarities between them.","Vancouver-based artist Tim Lee employs a wide range of media, including photography, video, installation, and performance to revisit and reinterpret—often humorously—particular historical moments through a constellation of references.","Party for your right to fight, public enemy, 1988",Americas,"['populace.n.01', 'head.n.01', 'artist.n.01', 'spectator.n.01', 'video.n.01', 'party.n.01', 'record.n.01', 'scheme.n.01', 'pair.n.01', 'conceptual.s.01', 'screen.n.01']","['impersonation.n.03', 'hip-hop.n.01', 'art_history.n.01', 'video_recording.n.01', 'discordance.n.01', 'referential.s.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/tim_lee_untitled_party_for_your_right_to_fight_public_enemy.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/tim_lee_untitled_party_for_your_right_to_fight_public_enemy-300x237.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/party-for-your-right-to-fight-public-enemy-1988/,"['Cultural/18.17261290481105', 'Individual_Personal/5.670676691729323', 'Society/4.907070707070707']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Society']",28.75036030361108,"['Arts/9.988210722885645', 'History/3.3070707070707073', 'Technology/3.202614379084967']","['Arts', 'History', 'Technology']",16.49789580904132,"['Individual_Personal/5.741025641025641', 'Politics/3.2113360323886644', 'Society/3.1076923076923078']","['Individual_Personal', 'Politics', 'Society']",12.060053981106613,"['Mind/2.6', 'Politics/1.5692307692307694', 'Spirituality/1.5384615384615385']","['Mind', 'Politics', 'Spirituality']",5.707692307692308,0.6666666666666666,0.0

Luisa Lambri,"Custom-built for a silent film star in 1934 in Santa Monica, the Sten-Frenke House is an idiosyncratic icon. Designed by the architect Richard Neutra, its gray glass, white expanses, and simple forms exude austerity. Luisa Lambri’s photograph Untitled (Sten-Frenke House #04) (2007)recalls the unembellished elegance of the structure while also alluding to modernist painting; the image is less a picture than an abstract expanse that conveys its own flatness. Whereas avant-garde paintings strove to suggest nothing but their own essence, Lambri inverts this aim, using the two-dimensionality of the photographic print to point elsewhere.","Rudolph Schindler’s designs, part of a practice he called “Space Architecture,” marry interior with exterior and space with light. The architect’s longtime studio and residence, which he built in Los Angeles in 1922, exemplifies this philosophy, and has since become an influential part of the modernist architectural canon. In Untitled (Schindler House #01) (2007), Luisa Lambri describes Schindler’s studio by capturing its aftereffects—the play of light and shadow cast through branches onto a surface.

Luisa Lambri,"Lambri’s careful framing in Untitled (Miller House, #02) redefines our understanding of this iconic mid-century modernist building located in Columbus, Indiana. Commissioned by industrialist J. Irwin Miller and his wife Xenia Simons Miller, and built by Eero Saarinen in 1953, the Miller house’s open and flowing layout expands upon modernist architectural traditions. It features a flat roof, stone and glass walls, with rooms configured beneath a grid pattern of skylights and supporting cruciform steel columns. Rather than a distanced view of the overall structure—favored by modernist architectural photographers like Julius Shulman—Lambri instead works from the inside, focusing on Saarinen’s windows and the soft, even light. The resulting image is a poetic abstraction, an architectural photograph that yields not only a picture of a building, but suggests what it actually feels like to be in that architectural space.","Rudolph Schindler’s designs, part of a practice he called “Space Architecture,” marry interior with exterior and space with light.

Mike Kelley,"Towhead n’Ganga, enclosed in darkness, lorded over by the sexualized folded high priestless form reflects many of Kelley’s works, in both its compositional and semantic qualities. The drawing on wood, the popcorn mixture, and the title all manifest a bumpy fullness, a “more-is-more” conflation between supposedly eternal spirituality and everyday stuff. The work’s title points to a serious timelessness completely belied by the materials. While the composition is attractive, the objects themselves efface a potentially straightforward meaning. This is underscored by the label left on the outer bucket, which keeps it tethered to everyday life and away from the free-floating and romantic mysticism associated with the installations of Joseph Beuys.","Mike Kelley’s sculptures, collages, performances, and videos often rework the artifacts of suburban culture into new forms: bodies, carpets, and less-distinct masses. Kelley laces the mess of erotics and death into the material stuff of the American imaginary, such as movies, country music, and stuffed animals. Somehow, Kelley manages to do so in a way that extend these materials’ predilections, rather than counter them.","Towhead n’Ganga enclosed in darkness, lorded over by the sexualized folded high priestless form",Americas,"['everyday.s.01', 'title.n.01', 'material.n.01', 'everyday.s.01 life.n.01', 'wood.n.01', 'dark.n.01', 'installation.n.01', 'quality.n.01', 'composition.n.01', 'meaning.n.01', 'object.n.01', 'life.n.01', 'form.n.01']","['materiality.n.02', 'ambiguity.n.01', 'eternity.n.01', 'dateless.s.04', 'spirituality.n.02', 'occlusion.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/mike_kelley_towhead_nganga_enclosed_in_darkness_lorded_over_the_sexualized_folded_high_priestless_form.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/mike_kelley_towhead_nganga_enclosed_in_darkness_lorded_over_the_sexualized_folded_high_priestless_form-200x300.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/towhead-nganga-enclosed-in-darkness-lorded-over-by-the-sexualized-folded-high-priestless-form/,"['Material_Physical/7.997979797979798', 'Individual_Personal/2.6']","['Material_Physical', 'Individual_Personal']",10.597979797979798,"['Time/4.288888888888889', 'Materiality/1.9090909090909092', 'Spirituality/1.0']","['Time', 'Materiality', 'Spirituality']",7.197979797979798,"['Material_Physical/13.122186310421606', 'Individual_Personal/7.391452991452991', 'Society/3.342124542124542']","['Material_Physical', 'Individual_Personal', 'Society']",23.85576384399914,"['Materiality/5.124786324786325', 'Environmental/3.284981684981685', 'Time/2.8235294117647056']","['Materiality', 'Environmental', 'Time']",11.233297421532715,0.8,0.6666666666666666

Included in the Kadist Collection, these works continue to explore the ontology of the image to investigate the relationship between painting, photography, and a new time-based variable: film. Reduced here to the essential function of recording the exposure of light through the apparatus of a lens, Kantor then translated these film stills into painted colored canvases that retain the 3:4 aspect ratio of the 16mm film as well as the exact size of the projected image. The resulting paintings depict the “lens flares” in the film—the fleeting reflective glare inside the camera apparatus that results from when its lens is pointed directly at a bright light source.",Jordan Kantor’s artworks explore relationships between painting and photographic mediums.

Javier Castro,"In the film La Edad de Oro (The Golden Age) Javier Castro asks several children to describe what they want to be when they grow up and what their best career option is in Cuba. Their responses are telling: some hopeful or playful in nature as one would expect, and others crudely revealing the harsh reality that the children perceive. The work takes its title from a children’s magazine produced by José Martí in 1889, during the years leading to the Cuban War of Independence from Spain in which Marti lost his life. Containing drawings, short stories, and poems, the magazine highlighted the phrase “the children are the hope of the future,” which became a central rally of the Cuban revolution. A pertinent and powerful work, La Edad de Oro speaks of the fallibility of the revolutionary ideal, exposing the struggle of Cuban society and its anxiety about the future—all of it as seen through the eyes of their young.","Javier Castro was born in the in the neighbourhood of San Isidro in the heart of Habana Vieja, Cuba, where he lives and works. Influenced by the unique historical and present idiosyncrasies that define his neighbourhood—which is famous both as the site of José Martí’s (poet and martyr of the war for independence from Spain) childhood home, and the birthplace and murder of Alberto Yarini, a Cuban pimp, racketeer, and heroic symbol of Cuban identity—he films daily scenes from this area of the city, studying its tensions with an anthropological eye. Although he has previously worked in several media including installation and photography, he grew interested in video because of its ability portray the vitality of the present moment in the most immediate way possible. For Castro, it’s essential to capture reality in its most raw and unadulterated form, and hence he uses as little equipment as possible—no lights, sets or scripts—in order to preserve the natural dynamics of an environment. As a consequence, the people we see in his videos are never subject to artificial conditions. As described by Castro, the neighbourhood is his studio and his role as an artist is not to produce work, but rather to find and capture it without touching it. The social dimension of his practice is also important for Castro. At its very core, his work is about the people that he depicts and his own interrelations with them as another inhabitant of Habana Vieja. It’s this closeness and familiarity that allows him to earn his subjects’ trust, which ultimately leads to their honest portrayal. From his interactions with people emerge questions that speak of the human condition: the economy, language, sexuality, and violence all entangled in the stories of sociality and survival in Havana.",La Edad de Oro,Americas,"['child.n.01', 'magazine.n.01', 'phrase.n.01', 'struggle.n.01', 'age.n.01', 'short.a.01', 'eyes.n.01', 'future.n.01', 'produce.v.01', 'cardinal.s.01', 'society.n.01', 'war.n.01', 'nature.n.01', 'drawing.n.01', 'world.n.03', 'title.n.01', 'narrative.n.01', 'movie.n.01', 'life.n.01']","['child.n.02', 'future.n.01', 'career.n.02', 'anxiety.n.01', 'job.n.02', 'cuba.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG__The-Golden-Age_-Javier-Castro-5_WEB.png,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG__The-Golden-Age_-Javier-Castro-5_WEB-300x163.png,https://kadist.org/work/la-edad-de-oro-the-golden-age/,"['Material_Physical/8.683660130718955', 'Society/6.471093268616488', 'Politics/4.711702332754964']","['Material_Physical', 'Society', 'Politics']",19.866455732090408,"['Time/4.3124183006535945', 'Urbanization/3.948315736551031', 'Land/3.5712418300653597']","['Time', 'Urbanization', 'Land']",11.831975867269984,"['Cultural/25.142997557474608', 'Individual_Personal/13.062271062271066', 'Material_Physical/9.324786324786325']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Material_Physical']",47.530054944532,"['Media/10.923461935381441', 'Arts/5.212698412698412', 'Time/4.488888888888889']","['Media', 'Arts', 'Time']",20.625049236968742,0.3333333333333333,0.3333333333333333
Enrique Ramirez,"Ramirez’s The International Sail is the fifth in a series that features an upside-down worn out, mended and fragmented boat sail. These works epitomize the idea of perpetual movement and migration while carrying a deep personal meaning in the creative process, as the artist’s father himself, still living in Chile, mends and sends the sails to his son, living in Europe. The reversed position of the sail recalls both the shape of South America itself and the Eurocentric view that in the Southern Hemisphere, everything is “upside-down.” The stitches themselves create an illusion of an alternative political geography, and the framed-cuts impose a cartographic grid.","Enrique Ramirez produces media and photography-based work that explores the interrelationship between landscape and “subjective imaginary.” Born in Santiago, Chile, during dictator Augusto Pinochet’s violent rule, Ramirez’s highly politicized practice questions notions of exile, displacement, loss of memory and a changing sense of place. Growing up with a sail-maker father, his process often returns to the sea as a backdrop for his investigations of geo-politics. Open spaces and vast landscapes prevalent in his seductive films and installations serve as breathing room for contemplation and imagination. A sense of longing and nostalgia often haunts his works as Ramirez engages both personal recollections and gathered stories of loss and deracination. He has exhibited his work at international venues such as the Palais de Tokyo, Paris; Loop Fair, Spain; and Museo Amparo, Mexico. He received his BA in Film Studies from Instituto de Artes y Communicacion ARCOS, Chile and a Master in Contemporary Art from the Studio National des Arts Contemporains in France.",n°5 The International Sail,Americas,"['grid.n.01', 'illusion.n.01', 'father.n.01', 'europe.n.01', 'creative.a.01', 'united_states.n.01', 'position.n.01', 'south.n.01', 'personal.a.01', 'shape.n.01', 'meaning.n.01', 'idea.n.01', 'position.n.03', 'motion.n.03', 'procedure.n.01', 'political.a.01', 'series.n.01']","['decolonization.n.01', 'south.r.01', 'inversion.n.01', 'power.n.01', 'mapmaking.n.01', 'sail.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_EnriqueRamirez_TheInternationalSail_WEB.png,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_EnriqueRamirez_TheInternationalSail_WEB-277x300.png,https://kadist.org/work/n5-the-international-sail/,"['Politics/3.511655011655012', 'Cultural/3.2706043956043955', 'Material_Physical/2.4000000000000004']","['Politics', 'Cultural', 'Material_Physical']",9.182259407259409,"['Power/2.511655011655012', 'Arts/1.7321428571428572', 'Geopolitics/1.0']","['Power', 'Arts', 'Geopolitics']",5.243797868797869,"['Individual_Personal/24.44053724053725', 'Cultural/18.35466494290024', 'Material_Physical/15.52476704581968']","['Individual_Personal', 'Cultural', 'Material_Physical']",58.31996922925717,"['Land/9.875194396247029', 'Values/5.92967032967033', 'Mind/5.907692307692308']","['Land', 'Values', 'Mind']",21.712557033609666,0.6666666666666666,0.0
Agatha Gothe-Snape,"Agatha Gothe-Snape’s POWERPOINTS is an ongoing series of digital artworks that have been created with Microsoft PowerPoint. They are endless loops with sound. POWERPOINTS parallel Gothe-Snape’s broader conceptual practice stemming from improvisational performance. They draw upon and are records of interpersonal and spatio-emotional exchanges around art and art contexts. They are characterised by impulsive response, might relate directly to other artworks or form a backdrop for performance. Like much of Gothe-Snape’s work, POWERPOINTS employ colour and language emotively.","Based in improvisational performance, the meeting point between artistic process and social context is a central theme in Agatha Gothe-Snape’s work.

Khvay Samnang,"The video Rubber Man continues exploring issues related to land use, also noticeable in his Untitled series (2011). More specifically, Rubber Man addresses the French colonial legacy of land use for the exploitation of rubber –today exploited by multiple forces such as individuals, governments, multinationals and international banks– and its effects on Cambodia’s indigenous forests and culture today. The video takes place in Ratanakiri, an area in northeastern Cambodia increasingly known in local and international news for land grabs and protests, and where the artist frequently traveled to over two years. In the video, the artist appears as wandering around the crops as if lost, punctually pouring fresh liquid rubber over his body, and wondering if the ancestor spirits and indigenous communities who heavily rely on each other to subsist will continue to live.","Hearsay, intuition, direct exchanges with people, and a belief in dreams and premonition often prompt artist Khvay Samnang, who then follows stories he believes require intervention. Approaching what he considers to be universal themes through the Cambodian context, his works deal with unknown yet important events or current contentious social issues for his surrounding community. In his works spanning photography, video, sculpture and performance, the artist frequently uses simple and playful gestures as visual language to shade new lights onto of historical and cultural events and a means for resisting to the polarizing language of dominant media and legal powers covering the issues.",Rubber Man,Asia,"['land.n.01', 'video.n.01', 'protest.n.01', 'french.a.01', 'force.n.01', 'lose.v.01', 'multiple.a.01', 'effects.n.01', 'local.a.01', 'issue.n.01', 'government.n.01', 'community.n.01', 'person.n.01', 'culture.n.01', 'body.n.01', 'series.n.01']","['colonialism.n.01', 'autochthonal.s.01', 'exploitation.n.01', 'community.n.01', 'social.a.01', 'environment.n.02']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_Khvay-Samnang-Rubber-Man-2014-Digital-C-Print-80-x-120-cm-Edition-of-3-1AP-120-x-180-cm-Edition-of-4-1AP-1_WEB.png,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_Khvay-Samnang-Rubber-Man-2014-Digital-C-Print-80-x-120-cm-Edition-of-3-1AP-120-x-180-cm-Edition-of-4-1AP-1_WEB-300x200.png,https://kadist.org/work/rubber-man/,"['Society/12.021104042156676', 'Material_Physical/6.421978021978021', 'Politics/5.109273182957393']","['Society', 'Material_Physical', 'Politics']",23.552355247092088,"['Land/6.421978021978021', 'Community/2.8', 'Colonization/2.7777777777777777']","['Land', 'Community', 'Colonization']",11.9997557997558,"['Material_Physical/14.686813186813193', 'Individual_Personal/11.928205128205132', 'Politics/7.044230769230769']","['Material_Physical', 'Individual_Personal', 'Politics']",33.6592490842491,"['Space/6.346153846153846', 'Mind/4.774358974358975', 'Land/4.406593406593407']","['Space', 'Mind', 'Land']",15.527106227106229,0.6666666666666666,0.3333333333333333
Abigail DeVille,"The work La Loge Harlem focuses on the history of Harlem and its development over the last 200 years. It was a playground for the rich in the 19th century and where Old New York had its summer homes and diversions. The center image is a portrait of the artist’s grandmother when she was 16 in 1949. She and her mother were a part of the Great Migration moving to Harlem in 1943 from Richmond, VA. The glass and images are in reference on racist policing polices and a theory called Broken Windows that started in the early 1980s and which is implemented by the NYPD till today. In practice, Broken Windows has come to be synonymous with misdemeanor arrests and summonses. In New York, the largest city to implement the practice, between 2010 and 2015, police issued 1.8 million quality of life summonses for offenses like disorderly conduct, public urination, and drinking or possessing small amounts of marijuana.","African American artist Abigail DeVille’s large sculptures and installations reflect on social and cultural oppression, racial identity, and discrimination in American history.

Guan Xiao,"Mixed clips from her collection of thousands of images found online, the three-channel video Weather Forecast is an inquiry into the necessity of a physical movement (a travel) for our identity to transform or change. The question “Why can’t we view Europe from a chair?” periodically punctuates the video, suggesting that a similar personal transformation could occur by experiencing a place through the Internet and staying in the same place. Few episodes appear, each being a transformation process in itself, either by correlation, juxtaposition, combinations of specific matters such as iconography, texts, landscapes, events. Drawing a parallel between how identity transforms and how weather evolves over time, the video possibly hints to an escape from current political and geopolitical issues, and expressly on in the context of the refugee crisis and terrorism in Europe.","In her video and sculptural works, Guan Xiao often addresses ideas of permanence, transformations, and perception. For the artist, our surrounding world is in constant process of change, never fixed, always influx. As such, no human being, object or phenomenon is static or definable. Rather our identity is shaped by what we are exposed to through our visual and auditory experiences.

Reyes Santiago Rojas,"The work Sarta (String) by Reyes Santiago Roja is part of a larger series of works that examine the commercialization of the tobacco plant and its relationship to the meaning and use of tobacco by Native American tribes such as the Mayas, Aztecs, Incas or Tainos, which attributed spiritual qualities to tobacco such as the smoke carrying one’s thoughts and prayers to the sprits. In this work the artist studied the forms of tobacco leaves native to Latin America and recreated their shapes with commercial tobacco packaging from such global brands as Marlboro or Camel to the most popular Colombian brand Pielroja. The leaves made of the packaging material are lined up on a string as if they are hung out to dry as in traditional tobacco making processes.","Reyes Santiago Rojas works with themes relates to nature, patience and garbage.

Bobo,"Simon & Gus by Bobo is a binaural and fantastical artwork that tells the story of a sea steading maker-hobbyist as told from the perspective of an arduino board, and a mars dwelling stop motion animator as told from the perspective of a stop motion armature. The stop motion animator attends an artist residency on the red planet, and eventually sets out to start his own artist colony (a martian animation studio) with stupefying hubris. The result has disastrous consequences, with the martian ghosts eventually swallowing his soul, and his armature gaining full access to the animator’s motor skills and control of his ability to move. The diy maker attends a hackerbot conference, and decides to start his own sea colony for hackers, tinkerers and their like but his motives get upended as well, with the arduino board overtaking the maker’s consciousness. The two narratives are united in a surreal story structure, in time, and in form. They both play out symmetrically in many respects, on two video screens running a speed reading product running at 1000 words per minute so users can soak up as much of this narrative in as little time as possible.","Bobo is an art collective constituting the artists Nick Payne, Andrew Gillespie, and Phil Cote, and while as a collective entity they are relatively new to the art world, they have been highly influential to many younger NY artists.

Rodney Graham,"Dance!!!!! continues Graham’s long-standing fascination with the myth of the American West, an idea he investigates through its prevalence in movies, music, and legends. Here, the artist recreates the familiar, hackneyed saloon scene from Hollywood Westerns in which a man—played by Graham himself—is forced to “dance” because bullets are being shot at his feet. Considered a “staged photograph,” Dance!!! reenacts and isolates a culturally repetitive “event.” In doing so, Graham is able to falsify personal experience thus questioning the “true” origin of every Western scene held in our collective cultural memory.","Conceptual artist Rodney Graham’s oeuvre is highly versatile and intellectual. By incorporating fictional narratives and alternative interpretations into an existing context, Graham creates visual puns that layer historical reference to examine social and philosophical systems. Not only is Graham the behind-the-scenes sculptor, photographer, filmmaker, inventor, scholar, writer and singer in his projects, he also literally appears in the finished works, impersonating various fictional characters.",Dance!!!,Americas,"['dance.n.01', 'scene.n.01', 'west.n.01', 'keep.v.01', 'shoot.v.01', 'western.a.01', 'familiar.a.01', 'music.n.01', 'see.v.05', 'corporate.s.03', 'american.a.01', 'personal.a.01', 'beginning.n.04', 'event.n.01', 'idea.n.01', 'memory.n.01', 'cultural.a.01', 'experience.n.01', 'movie.n.01', 'photograph.n.01']","['western.a.02', 'parody.n.02', 'mythologization.n.01', 'stagy.s.01', 'mythology.n.01', 'american.a.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/rodney_graham_dance_2008.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/rodney_graham_dance_2008-300x229.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/dance/,"['Cultural/3.149317349317349', 'Politics/0.8', 'Individual_Personal/0.8']","['Cultural', 'Politics', 'Individual_Personal']",4.749317349317349,"['Arts/1.5800865800865802', 'Values/0.8', 'Technology/0.8']","['Arts', 'Values', 'Technology']",3.18008658008658,"['Cultural/33.6274707318825', 'Individual_Personal/19.02612942612943', 'Material_Physical/17.113883502118796']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Material_Physical']",69.76748366013072,"['Culture/10.631221719457017', 'Arts/9.736064425770309', 'Mind/9.184615384615386']","['Culture', 'Arts', 'Mind']",29.55190152984271,0.6666666666666666,0.3333333333333333
Tina Modotti,"Modotti’s Diego Rivera Mural: Billionaires Club; Ministry of Education, Mexico D.F., Third Gallery is a photograph of a section of a mural by Diego Rivera in the Ministry of Education in Mexico City. Rivera painted over a hundred frescoes throughout the courtyard of the building, an early mural series that helped revive and popularize the art of mural painting. Modotti, a friend of Rivera’s, took hundreds of photographs of the frescoes which depict divisions of labor in Mexican society. This particular photograph focuses on Rivera’s rendering of a dinner of the elite, feasting and reading a stock ticker.","Tina Modotti was an Italian film actress and photographer. As a photographer, she collaborated with Edward Weston and extensively documented the Mexican mural movement. In addition to her photography of Diego Rivera’s murals, she is also depicted in five of them. Modotti was involved in both the artistic and political avant-gardes of Mexico City, befriending members of and eventually joining the Mexican Communist party. Political repression forced her to move back to Europe, and she eventually lived in Moscow before moving to Spain when the Civil war began in 1936.

Piero Golia,"Golia’s Untitled 3 is an installation in which a mechanical device is programmed to shoot clay pigeons that are thrown up in front of a white wall. More than a simple reference to the sport, the work has the disconcerting effect of creating a danger zone in the gallery space. The reference to direct aggression or violence is reinforced by the piece’s rapid pace. But on another level, Untitled 3’s steady rhythm seems to constitute an alternate way of measuring time, an idea explored in other works in the Kadist Collection, like Mungo Thomson’s Untitled (TIME), Geoffrey Farmer’s Ongoing Time Stabbed with a Dagger, and William E. Jones’s Killed, in which the rapid succession of images also points towards the passing of time in the historical sense.","Italian-born and Los Angeles-based Piero Giolia’s work assumes the form of actions, sculptures, and installations often characterized as being extreme yet poetic. With a particular love for mischief, Golia takes everyday gestures and pushes them to the limit in order to cast an ironic look at contemporary society. Following the steps of legendary artists such as Bas Jan Ader, some of Golia’s works have taken the form of adventurous trips, like Going to Tirana (2000), in which he rowed across the Adriatic Sea, moving in the direction opposite from migrants trying to leave Albania.",Untitled #1 #2 #3,Europe,"['time.n.01', 'mention.n.01', 'rhythm.n.01', 'shoot.v.01', 'research.v.02', 'degree.n.01', 'simple.a.01', 'violence.n.01', 'historical.a.01', 'idea.n.01', 'sense.n.01', 'wall.n.01', 'white.a.01', 'piece.n.01', 'space.n.01', 'image.n.01']","['temporal.a.02', 'aggression.n.03', 'assembly.n.01', 'machine.n.01', 'passage.n.01', 'disorienting.a.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/piero_golia_untitled3.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/piero_golia_untitled3-199x300.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/untitled-1-2-3/,"['Cultural/12.817383107088991', 'Society/8.153333087621014', 'Material_Physical/4.374248120300752']","['Cultural', 'Society', 'Material_Physical']",25.34496431501076,"['Technology/9.670374560080441', 'Time/2.732142857142857', 'Violence/2.5702380952380954']","['Technology', 'Time', 'Violence']",14.972755512461394,"['Individual_Personal/18.167032967032974', 'Cultural/10.52893772893773', 'Material_Physical/8.84932844932845']","['Individual_Personal', 'Cultural', 'Material_Physical']",37.545299145299154,"['Mind/7.503296703296703', 'Values/5.92967032967033', 'Culture/5.5769230769230775']","['Mind', 'Values', 'Culture']",19.00989010989011,0.6666666666666666,0.0
Rachel Foster,"Rachel E. Foster uses printmaking, sculpture, and photography to illuminate the nearly invisible. For her source material she combs the digital world for bits of strange information that seep into our daily reality. These clues, be they coded sequences or simple phrases, become part of her puzzle; by reframing information she makes us reconsider it through a different lens. Language is embedded in Foster’s work, but it is subject to play, often becoming obscured or reoriented. In Ghost I (2009) the word “ghost” becomes ghosted, rendered ominously in white chalk on black paper so that it resembles an apparition. Average Lifespan (2009) calculates the average lifespan of eight famous poets. This seemingly random equation reveals to us the age at which the poets died and forges a posthumous relationship among them.","Rachel Foster is concerned with showing the unseen.

Harrell Fletcher,"The American War, which takes its title from the Vietnamese term for what Americans call the Vietnam War, has toured the United States extensively with the goal of presenting a Vietnamese perspective of that history. The project began in 2005 when Fletcher visited the War Remnants Museum in Ho Chi Minh City. He was shocked by images that depicted the lasting effects of the war and the atrocities committed by the United States. Fletcher felt it important that these images be seen and discussed within an American context and, using a handheld digital camera, he photographed all of the museum’s images and labels. At that moment, Fletcher’s project resonated directly with the American intervention in Iraq and Afghanistan. The artist took extreme care in shooting the pictures from an angle that would diminish the flash reflection on the surfaces, and paid attention to capture the wall colors and the explanatory labels. In this sense, Fletcher’s re-creation of the Vietnamese installation not only shares important information but also recontextualizes it in a way that comments on the subjective and constructed nature of representation, both artistic and historic.","Harrell Fletcher’s socially-engaged, interdisciplinary projects reflect his keen critique of socio-political phenomena that involves the United States.",The American War,Americas,"['war.n.01', 'american.a.01', 'museum.n.01', 'undertaking.n.01', 'american.n.01', 'image.n.01', 'effects.n.01', 'intervention.n.01', 'digital.a.01', 'picture.n.01', 'colors.n.01', 'contemplation.n.02', 'attention.n.01', 'surface.n.01', 'moment.n.01', 'representation.n.01', 'nature.n.01', 'sense.n.01', 'position.n.03', 'wall.n.01', 'context.n.01', 'camera.n.01', 'city.n.01', 'title.n.01', 'history.n.01']","['war.n.01', 'recreate.v.04', 'position.n.03', 'photograph.n.01', 'reflection.n.02', 'vietnamese.a.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/harrell_fletcher_the_american_way_2005.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/harrell_fletcher_the_american_way_2005-300x235.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/the-american-war/,"['Society/6.048529411764706', 'Cultural/5.024622926093515', 'Politics/3.2']","['Society', 'Cultural', 'Politics']",14.273152337858221,"['Politics/3.2', 'War/2.75', 'Violence/1.6985294117647058']","['Politics', 'War', 'Violence']",7.648529411764706,"['Cultural/27.98690192676262', 'Individual_Personal/22.099150118886968', 'Society/20.332315233785824']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Society']",70.41836727943542,"['Mind/10.003320802005014', 'Culture/8.946153846153848', 'Media/5.964102564102564']","['Mind', 'Culture', 'Media']",24.913577212261426,0.6666666666666666,0.0

Geoffrey Farmer,"Ongoing Time Stabbed with a Dagger was Farmer’s first kinetic sculpture that added a cinematic character to an “ever-reconfiguring play presented in real time.” The assembly of various objects and props on top of a large platform constitutes not only a work, but, to a certain extent, a show in itself. The title of the piece comes from the literal translation of René Magritte’s painting from 1938, La Durée Poignardée, whose more familiar translation is “Time Transfixed.”","Geoffrey Farmer borrows equally from the traditions of installation and conceptual art to create carefully staged works that emphasize temporality and fiction, and examine history, art history, and popular culture. His interest in theatricality is particularly evident in pieces like Theater of Cruelty (2009) and And Finally the Street Becomes the Main Character [Clock] (2008) in which various fragments are assembled into epic narratives.

Tadasu Takamine,"The video work Japan Syndrome is a continuation of his lines of inquiry, taking post-Fukushima Japan as a case study. The work constructs a theatrical space in which the conflict-filled life sphere of post-Fukushima Japan, and perhaps beyond it, is reenacted in a minimal yet condensed fashion. To conceive this work, the artists has recorded real conversations he had with shop employees in Kyoto, Yamaguchi and Mito from 2011 to 2013, which have been then reenacted as performances in a studio, and recorded as the final form of this piece. In each re-enactment a protagonist subtly asks a shopkeeper or waiter probing questions regarding the origins of certain products: where fish were sourced, whether fruit has been tested and what is deemed safe to eat. With always an extraordinary politeness, the protagonists discuss radiation level check system, government responsibility, decline of the region (as in the Mito version shared here, closer to the source of radiation). In a very minimal and simple way, Japan Syndrome examines the consequences of the radiation for Fukushima, and Japan as a whole, which remain invisible as immeasurable, but they nevertheless encroach on everyday life. It also reveals the constant changes in the social conditions of the country and the population’s consciousness after Fukushima disaster, addressing how individuals resist to the growing collective consciousness and social oppression, towards the spectre of an uncertain future and the unquantifiable damage that has been caused.","Tadasu Takamine is one of the most controversial, thought provoking, and irreverent media, video and installation artist working in Japan. He began as a member of the influential Japanese multimedia-performance group Dumb Type, which has existed since the 1980s and investigated contemporary biopolitics.  In a deep engagement with his own physicality and personal life, he has now been active for over a decade as a freelance director and artist, and has devoted himself to a theatre practice that he develops experimentally in workshops in dialogue with local participants. Both in the theatre as well as in artistic projects, he grapples with gnawing social questions provocatively and with dark humor.  Born in Kagoshima, Japan, in 1968, he has exhibited extensively throughout Asia, North America and Europe, as well as Australia, Israel, Mexico and South Africa.

Ad Minoliti,"G.S.F.C. #3 (Geometrical Sci-Fi Cyborg) belongs to a series of paintings that build upon the artist’s exploration into feminist speculative fiction and the cyborg as a creature of contemporary reality and fiction. The cyborg painting, as she calls it, is made through a smearing of human and machine in which the composition of color landscape with outlines of anthropomorphized forms is stenciled and airbrushed onto canvas, then photographed an printed onto canvas. Once this is done, Minoliti goes back over the printed canvas with paint. Minoliti’s cyborg painting is an image of Donna Haraway’s metaphor of the cyborg–a part human, part machine hybrid mining the inseparable relationship we have to our technologies.","Ad Minoliti is a painter who combines the pictorial language of geometric abstraction with the perspective of queer theory. Engaging in a diversity of formats and media from easel painting to installation, she assumes painting not as a mere material practice, but rather as a visual set of ideas to approach normative categories of sexuality and biology. Throughout her work, geometrical forms and surreal landscapes serve to imagine a post-humanist setting in which feminist and gender theories can be applied to an open interpretation of painting, design, and art history.",G.S.F.C. #3,Americas,"['machine.n.01', 'fiction.n.01', 'exploration.n.01', 'print.v.01', 'animal.n.01', 'technology.n.01', 'paint.n.01', 'metaphor.n.01', 'color.n.01', 'composition.n.01', 'relationship.n.01', 'contemporary.s.01', 'world.n.03', 'human.a.01', 'landscape.n.01', 'form.n.01', 'series.n.01', 'image.n.01']","['color.n.01', 'eye.n.01', 'cyborg.n.01', 'feminist_movement.n.01', 'abstraction.n.04', 'engineering.n.02']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/IMG_AM_GSFC3_RAW_WEB-copy.png,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/IMG_AM_GSFC3_RAW_WEB-copy-300x160.png,https://kadist.org/work/g-s-f-c-3/,"['Cultural/17.101436188510494', 'Material_Physical/4.288888888888889', 'Individual_Personal/3.4248366013071894']","['Cultural', 'Material_Physical', 'Individual_Personal']",24.81516167870657,"['Arts/8.402906776745786', 'Technology/4.541666666666666', 'Language/2.3790849673202614']","['Arts', 'Technology', 'Language']",15.323658410732714,"['Cultural/26.478129713423833', 'Individual_Personal/8.061813186813186', 'Material_Physical/6.925396825396825']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Material_Physical']",41.46533972563385,"['Technology/6.480882352941176', 'Fantasy/6.291666666666667', 'Culture/5.384615384615385']","['Technology', 'Fantasy', 'Culture']",18.15716440422323,1.0,0.3333333333333333

Tamar Guimarães,"Canoas by Tamar Guimarães is a film made for the 2010 São Paulo biennial as an exercise in the projection of national identity, made during a time of great optimism about Brazil’s future. The main subject and setting of the film is Casa das Canoas, a home that architect Oscar Niemeyer built for himself in the early 1950s. Overlooking the bay on the outskirts of Rio de Janeiro, the building has achieved iconic status in Brazil. Although a private residence, it served as an important site for cultural gatherings of Brazil’s elite and international guests.   The film Canoas restages a glamorous cocktail party with actors and non-actors at the residence in which dancing and drinking punctuate conversations about modernity, social housing, political dictatorship and artistic exile. Framing the festivities is the movement and interaction of servants as they prepare for the party and then leave for their own homes in the morning. And it is here in these small transitional moments that Guimarães’s work is most critical, speaking directly to the contradictions inherent in the famed architect’s creations and the failed promise of modernity as expressed between the disparity between the labor and leisure classes. Aimed to produce an architecture that was for the people and a better future, the conditions and context that produced Niemeyer’s work also further entrenched the social and class divisions in Brazil.","Tamar Guimarães explores the history of modernism, colonialism, and shamanism in Latin America through a manifold practice of film, video, sound, sculpture, and installation work. Using ethno-fiction and collectivist models, often working with non-actors and employing discursive forms of research, her films call into question political histories as they concern the real and the present.",Canoas,Americas,"['party.n.01', 'class.n.01', 'future.n.01', 'movie.n.01', 'social.a.01', 'status.n.01', 'gathering.n.01', 'national.a.01', 'setting.n.01', 'private.a.01', 'critical.a.01', 'leave.v.01', 'conversation.n.01', 'creation.n.01', 'actor.n.01', 'projection.n.01', 'iconic.a.01', 'celebrated.s.01', 'architecture.n.01', 'produce.v.01', 'building.n.01', 'construct.v.01', 'moment.n.01', 'identity.n.01', 'context.n.01']","['identity.n.01', 'brazil.n.01', 'architecture.n.01', 'socialization.n.02', 'dictatorship.n.01', 'modernity.n.01', 'leisure.n.02', 'labor.n.01', 'class.n.03']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/IMG_TGM00008_Canoas_7WEB.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/IMG_TGM00008_Canoas_7WEB-300x224.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/canoas/,"['Individual_Personal/4.797979797979798', 'Society/4.1470085470085465', 'Cultural/2.6985294117647056']","['Individual_Personal', 'Society', 'Cultural']",11.643517756753049,"['Identity/4.797979797979798', 'Arts/2.6985294117647056', 'Land/2.6198830409356724']","['Identity', 'Arts', 'Land']",10.116392250680175,"['Cultural/28.632351145586455', 'Society/17.281252081252084', 'Individual_Personal/16.0127180009533']","['Cultural', 'Society', 'Individual_Personal']",61.92632122779184,"['Arts/14.099903038138335', 'Identity/5.567210567210567', 'Community/5.104695304695304']","['Arts', 'Identity', 'Community']",24.771808910044207,1.0,0.6666666666666666
Titus Kaphar,"Although the objects depicted in Titus Kaphar’s diptych 2016/1963 might not be immediately recognizable, the work’s title and the inscriptions ‘Alabama 1963’ and ‘North Dakota 2016’ reveal their use as tools of brutal force. The work with the inscription ‘Alabama 1963’ is a painting of the nozzle of a high-pressure water jet that the Birmingham Police used against black protesters, including children, during a non-violent campaign against racial segregation led by Martin Luther King JR. during the civil rights movement. The second painting depicts the nozzles used against protestors that in 2016 opposed the plans to build the Dakota Access pipeline near the Standing Rock Indian Reservation, many of whom were seriously hurt and left soaking wet during freezing temperatures. In both instances, the footage of the police’s inhumane response to non-violent protesting was broadcast globally, and these images have remained as a scar in our shared consciousness. Speaking to the longstanding impact of these acts of racially-driven cruelty, 2016/1963 is a chilling reminder that the systemic brutality endured by people of color during the civil rights movement is not something that solely remains in the past.","Titus Kaphar’s work is often discussed as socially and politically oriented, however, the artist describes it as a series of deeply personal responses to situations, narratives or histories. He is best known for revisiting historical forms of representation, primarily paintings, and modifying them—cutting areas out, painting over subjects, slashing, wrinkling, layering, and stitching elements out of or onto a painting. Through these formal interventions, Kaphar reveals subjects and narratives that were previously hidden or made peripheral. At the core of his interrogation of the past is the need to address how black bodies and other bodies of colour have been historically either invisiblized or represented as inferior, enslaved, imprisoned, powerless—never as the main subjects. Rather than undoing this problematic history, he brings it to the present and puts it to question by redirecting our gaze towards those subjectivities that have and continue to be excluded and inferiorized.",2016/1963,Americas,"['motion.n.03', 'consciousness.n.01', 'plan.n.01', 'picture.v.02', 'leave.v.01', 'tool.n.01', 'footage.n.01', 'water.n.01', 'rock.n.01', 'impact.n.01', 'child.n.01', 'color.n.01', 'construct.v.01', 'black.a.01', 'people.n.01', 'title.n.01', 'object.n.01', 'image.n.01']","['racism.n.01', 'civil_right.n.01', 'protest.n.02', 'violence.n.01', 'trauma.n.02', 'inequality.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/IMG_20161963_WEB.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/IMG_20161963_WEB-300x200.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/2016-1963/,"['Politics/15.98300489649595', 'Society/3.7104072398190047', 'Individual_Personal/3.2835164835164834']","['Politics', 'Society', 'Individual_Personal']",22.976928619831437,"['Activism/5.572208013640239', 'Inequality/5.428104575163398', 'Power/3.9826923076923073']","['Activism', 'Inequality', 'Power']",14.983004896495945,"['Material_Physical/15.570695970695978', 'Individual_Personal/13.587696617108385', 'Cultural/12.111613876319762']","['Material_Physical', 'Individual_Personal', 'Cultural']",41.27000646412412,"['Space/6.346153846153846', 'Mind/5.182934712346478', 'Culture/4.615384615384616']","['Space', 'Mind', 'Culture']",16.14447317388494,0.3333333333333333,0.0
Yuichiro Tamura,"The installation Hey Daddy, Hey Brother comprises a series of “Sukajan” jackets, which Tamura collected over a period of several years. They were a popular souvenir among the US military stations in postwar Japan during the Korean War (1950-1953). With origins rooted in military occupation of in the East Asia region, the jackets fuse the American “bomber,” or baseball jacket, with traditional hand-stitched designs of Japanese iconography, including dragons, tigers, Mt. Fuji or commemorative maps of Japan and Korea. The style became prominent amongst working class youth—and also associated with the Yakuza, Japan’s criminal syndicate—and have become coveted streetwear today. On display, the jackets reveal the impact of military occupation in East Asia and prevail as relics of youthful rebellion, globalization and nationhood, acting as artefacts or evidences of the linkages between supposedly distinct cultural and historical forces.","Yuichiro Tamura works in a wide range of media including video, photography, installation and performance. Delving into the memory and history of localities, he transforms them into new narratives that transcend time and space, presenting works that investigate the contemporary significance of past events.

Meriem Bennani,"Fly was first commissioned as an immersive video experience for Meriem Bennani’s first solo exhibition at MoMA PS1 in 2016, imitating the mosaic structure of a fly’s eyes with a patchwork of projectors. As a single channel video, this work focuses more on the succession of sequences, shot in Bennani’s hometown of Rabat, showing interviews with relatives, an open-air market or a wedding, and jamming them with surreal digital manipulations. A recurrence throughout the film is a fly that accompanies us along the journey, as a childish motif or the symbol of a vanitas, able to sing Rihanna’s song. Bennani succeeds in emphasizing the contradictions and bizarreness of everyday life, often felt in situations of acculturation. In the scene featuring three wedding dancers — sheikhas — joyfully rolling on the floor, Bennani replaces the original traditional wedding music with Philipp Glass’ The Grid. Both cathartic and a way to create her own augmented universe, Meriem Bennani describes her work as a constant back and forth between documentation and magical realism.","The work of Meriem Bennani traverses video, sculpture, multimedia installation, drawing, and instagram. Developing films, installations and immersive environments to interlace references to globalized popular culture with the vernacular and traditional representation of Moroccan culture and history, the artist’s work is composed with humor. Bennani is interested in questioning fractured identities in contemporary society; identifying and upheaving gendered histories, through the filter of digital technologies. In 2015, she produced the first episode of Fardaous Funjab, a satire based on a reality TV show depicting a hijab designer (“funjabs”, fun hijabs) whose delirious and absurdist creations propose to Muslim women headscarves with lipstick pockets or tennis balls. Bennani ingeniously transforms an at-times controversial religious attribute into a pop-fashion accessory. In her work, she is particularly interested in exploring the relationships between women in Morocco through her female relatives. Through her sophisticated multi-layering of 3D animation, documentary film, music videos, and soap operas, her projects mimic contemporary American pop culture to contrast, merge and to manipulate Moroccan identity and culture.",Fly,Middle East & Africa,"['grid.n.01', 'song.n.01', 'interview.n.01', 'everyday.s.01 life.n.01', 'market.n.01', 'motif.n.01', 'universe.n.01', 'glass.n.01', 'documentation.n.01', 'changeless.s.02', 'journey.n.01', 'sequence.n.01', 'eyes.n.01', 'music.n.01', 'floor.n.01', 'digital.a.01', 'video.n.01', 'symbol.n.01', 'traditional.a.01', 'shooting.n.01', 'individual.a.01', 'situation.n.01', 'original.s.01', 'structure.n.01', 'everyday.s.01']","['casual.s.03', 'phantasmagoric.s.01', 'family.n.02', 'temper.n.02', 'identity.n.01', 'woman.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Screen-Shot-.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Screen-Shot--300x170.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/fly/,"['Individual_Personal/17.15578865578866', 'Society/3.371794871794872', 'Cultural/1.0']","['Individual_Personal', 'Society', 'Cultural']",21.52758352758353,"['Emotion/11.35780885780886', 'Identity/4.797979797979798', 'Violence/2.371794871794872']","['Emotion', 'Identity', 'Violence']",18.52758352758353,"['Cultural/24.38241758241759', 'Material_Physical/16.088364576599876', 'Individual_Personal/13.01587301587302']","['Cultural', 'Material_Physical', 'Individual_Personal']",53.48665517489049,"['Arts/8.319413919413918', 'Space/6.679487179487179', 'Design/5.764102564102565']","['Arts', 'Space', 'Design']",20.763003663003662,0.6666666666666666,0.0

Pedro Reyes,"In Reyes’s words, “We should be able to extract the technological nutrients before we excrete our waste. There is a missing organ in our social metabolism which would work as a stomach or intestines. The Recyclone is a device made of plastic containers that fit into each other. (The plastic boxes are the equivalent to the ‘vellum,’ which are the tiny hairs that stick out from the intestinal wall to absorb nutrients). The permutation of this plastic bins could be customized to satisfy anyone’s recycling needs.” This work offers the possibility of a more visually appealing and adaptable recycling mechanism, assisting in the conscientious extraction of reusable material from industrial products.","Pedro Reyes’s works traverse the worlds of art, film, architecture, design, social criticism, and pedagogy. Educated as an architect, Reyes draws on this training to engage with utopian aspirations and the ongoing legacy of Modernism, often focusing on issues of scale and space while questioning pressing social issues through the incitement of individual or collective interaction. Although only a few of his works are directly located within the practice of building, almost all involve some kind of construction, whether they are objects, models, interiors, or social spaces. Reyes also makes use of strategies developed for communication or education, as well as everyday humor, to engage his audiences. Many of his works either allow large-scale public engagement or suggest a possible use: weapons turned to shovels, multilevel parks in old modernist buildings, and small spherical rooms. Like many avant-garde thinkers of the past, Reyes constructs new forms of architecture necessary for new ways of life.",Study for a Recycling Device,Unspecified,"['food.n.01', 'plastic.n.01', 'hair.n.01', 'box.n.01', 'possibility.n.01', 'wall.n.01', 'material.n.01', 'social.a.01']","['aesthetics.n.01', 'adaptability.n.01', 'recycling.n.01', 'garbage.n.03', 'arrangement.n.03', 'receptacle.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/pedro_reyes_study_for_a_recycling_device1.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/pedro_reyes_study_for_a_recycling_device1-300x179.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/study-for-a-recycling-device/,"['Cultural/12.243412452700381', 'Individual_Personal/4.247368421052632', 'Society/3.2040100250626566']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Society']",19.694790898815672,"['Arts/5.730994152046783', 'Technology/2.3790849673202614', 'Mind/1.7473684210526317']","['Arts', 'Technology', 'Mind']",9.857447540419678,"['Individual_Personal/4.0', 'Society/2.6', 'Cultural/2.6']","['Individual_Personal', 'Society', 'Cultural']",9.2,"['Mind/1.6', 'Spirituality/1.6', 'Community/1.0']","['Mind', 'Spirituality', 'Community']",4.2,1.0,0.3333333333333333

Johanna Calle,"Calle’s drawings all inhabit received forms but alter them to call attention to specific qualities. A newspaper is both reproduced and modified to call attention to the newspaper as a means of information transmission. This also emphasizes the effect of various seemingly unimportant support mechanisms: the role of visual layout and images. In other drawings Calle explores systems: the unfurling of suburban streets, resembling text and the veins on a leaf. These congruences point to the unity of Calle’s thematic interests: the circulation of information, human energies, and lives.","Johanna Calle’s drawings use pre-existing systems to explore issues of built space, cultural identity, and language. Her work often departs from common lines of handwriting, altering them with energy and pattern.

Julian Hoeber,"Every work in Hoeber’s 2011 series Execution Changes is titled in alphanumeric code. The geometric pattern that composes each acrylic-on-panel painting is determined by a preordained ratio of 2 to 3. But even though a formulaic system determines the image’s structure, its surface is full of painterly effects. While the minimalist appearance of these works references similarly striped paintings by Frank Stella, Hoeber does not emphasize the painting’s underlying structure but instead tugs it apart and obscures it. Layers of paint betray the image not as surface-and-support, but as presence with depth.","Using a variety of media, the Los Angeles–based artist Julian Hoeber produces fastidiously ordered compositions. His paintings, constructions, and installations emphasize concept and materiality even-handedly, resulting in works evocative of both intangible theory and concrete spatial relationships. His immersive environment Demon Hill (2010-2011) used gravity as its primary tool, while undermining everything certain about it; inside the space, the most predictable force on Earth operated at an unexpected and deeply disorienting angle. Uncommon sensation is a thread that runs through much of Hoeber’s work. The otherworldly springs from the readily available, unusually arranged. His paintings are situated somewhere between Modernism’s emphasis on the physical reality of the painting, Postmodernism’s fraying of that reality, and Op art’s insistence on playing perceptual tricks.",Execution Changes #22,Americas,"['structure.n.01', 'geometric.s.01', 'appearance.n.01', 'form.n.03', 'effects.n.01', 'paint.n.01', 'layer.n.01', 'presence.n.01', 'surface.n.01', 'image.n.01', 'mention.n.01', 'series.n.01']","['dimensionality.n.01', 'painterly.s.01', 'formulaic.s.01', 'materiality.n.02', 'stella.n.01', 'minimalism.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/julian_hoeber_execution_changes.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/julian_hoeber_execution_changes-200x300.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/execution-changes-22/,"['Material_Physical/2.709090909090909', 'Individual_Personal/1.6', 'Cultural/0.8333333333333334']","['Material_Physical', 'Individual_Personal', 'Cultural']",5.142424242424242,"['Materiality/1.9090909090909092', 'Design/0.8333333333333334', 'Identity/0.8']","['Materiality', 'Design', 'Identity']",3.542424242424243,"['Cultural/26.96813186813187', 'Society/12.80769230769231', 'Material_Physical/10.306593406593407']","['Cultural', 'Society', 'Material_Physical']",50.08241758241759,"['Arts/9.629670329670331', 'Design/7.923076923076923', 'Economy/7.115384615384617']","['Arts', 'Design', 'Economy']",24.66813186813187,0.6666666666666666,0.3333333333333333

Abraham Cruzvillegas,"A cadence is a configuration of notes that indicates the continuation or resolution of a melody or song. In speech, a cadence has a similar function but is generally associated with a falling inflection. The triad is the most common construction of a chord. Tres cadencias in English is “three cadences.” This 2005 work is an installation comprised of three strings of small felt flags that can be hung in variable configurations. Whereas these kinds of flags often represent professional or amateur sports affiliations, here Cruzvillegas turns such signs of team loyalty into a visual metaphor for a linguistic or musical structure by combining two simple, common objects. As the banners sag from the chords they create a visual harmony that represents falling inflections, musical chords, and individual notes that comprise a piece of music or a spoken phrase.","Abraham Cruzvillegas is known for his intricate and elaborate sculptures and installations made from found and scavenged materials.

Conrad Ruiz,"It may take a minute to recognize the background of New Fall Lineup – the colors are tweaked into a world of cartoon and candy, and it is covered by leaping energetic figures and flying squirrels. One realizes, though, that the image is of the World Trade Center exploding into flame, creating a strange contrast with the painting’s colors and the other images. The combination is peculiar because the role the explosion serves here is non-specific. The image loses its totemic weight, as it seems to not matter what particular explosion this is. The picture exists in a strange cultural subconscious of flight, candy, blockbuster movies, and the news, tied together by delicate tight painting.","Conrad Ruiz makes watercolor paintings of fantastic scenes.

Catherine Opie,"Although best known as a provocateur and portraitist, Opie also photographs landscapes, cityscapes, and architecture. The Freeway Series was developed in 1995, right after the artist’s inclusion in that year’s Whitney Biennial. As if suggesting that her work should not be restricted to being seen through overtly political or activist lenses, this series lends insight into the city of Los Angeles via its most characteristic urban feature: its highways. By documenting the monumental concrete structures devoid of humans or vehicles, one is suddenly conscious of their real scale, an element only emphasized by the small format of the printed photographs. The otherwise unnoticed massive structures are thus made strange. Like Allen Ruppersberg’s Untitled (City Limits), which also are taken along the freeway, Opie’s photographs have particular resonance within the Kadist’s “101 Collection.”","Since the 1990s, Catherine Opie has been recognized for her use of documentary photography to address issues of community and queerness, and the ways in which identity is shaped by architecture. Particularly resonant during the Culture Wars of the 1980s and early 1990s—a time in which the religious right tried to impose itself as a political force and cultural censor—Opie’s photographs privilege the representation of specific communities, whether the LGBT, teenagers, surfers, football players, or her group of friends who engage in sexual role playing, tattooing, and piercing.",Freeway Series,Americas,"['structure.n.01', 'city.n.01', 'world.n.08', 'lens.n.01', 'los_angeles.n.01', 'component.n.01', 'feature.n.01', 'photograph.n.01', 'format.n.01', 'architecture.n.01', 'scale.n.01', 'urban.a.01', 'series.n.01', 'real.a.01', 'political.a.01', 'landscape.n.01']","['cityscape.n.01', 'architecture.n.01', 'photography.n.01', 'urban.a.01', 'document.v.01', 'landscape.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/cathy_opie_untitled_26_from_freeway_series_1994_0.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/cathy_opie_untitled_26_from_freeway_series_1994_0-300x98.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/untitled-16-and-untitled-17-freeway-series/,"['Cultural/4.6458978328173375', 'Society/4.488888888888889', 'Material_Physical/1.8']","['Cultural', 'Society', 'Material_Physical']",10.934786721706228,"['Arts/4.6458978328173375', 'Urbanization/2.688888888888889', 'History/1.8']","['Arts', 'Urbanization', 'History']",9.134786721706227,"['Cultural/19.666548157724637', 'Society/16.31912095472467', 'Material_Physical/8.413725490196079']","['Cultural', 'Society', 'Material_Physical']",44.39939460264539,"['Urbanization/9.90800984361356', 'Arts/9.259609997845294', 'Land/5.780392156862745']","['Urbanization', 'Arts', 'Land']",24.948011998321597,1.0,0.6666666666666666
Mika Tajima,"Mika Tajima’s Pranayama sculptures are built from carved wood and chromed Jacuzzi jets and are presented as artefacts. The title refers to the control of the breath, ‘prana’ in Ayurvedic practice, as the regulation of the vital life force. According to the artist, the sculptures, mediating between two spaces, serve “as membrane, portal or filter between the immediate and the beyond. The gold jet nozzle patterns on the monoliths trace actual meridian acupressure point that control and release the energy flows in the human body.” They imply “an outward escape of a vast and abstract interior into the exhibition space like forced air.” The work is willfully ambiguous, with the potential to be read as both system of protection or a system of control.","Japanese-American artist Mika Tajima creates sculptures, paintings, videos, and installations with a focus on techniques and technologies of control. She studies architectural systems, ergonomic designs and psychographic data and the impact they have on the human body and relationships of power and submission. She investigates the way in which such design of spaces and environments impact upon the ways we comport ourselves both physically and in thought and desire.

Alain Séchas,"“To me, art equals responsibility”.  That is probably why Alain Séchas creates works according to the human scale, immediately evoking the human body. But rather than using the human figure, he chose that of the cat: a round-eyed feline which never smiles. ” Doing cats becomes like a trap, so that we identify a lot with it (…) and all the imagery of the cat reappears: the Egyptian cat, comics, caricature etc”.  Chosen as our anthropological equivalent, the cat plays various characters, often provocative, and becomes the intermediary between the artist and the viewer. More than a mere sculpture, he is a drawing with volume, a motif which endlessly changes: ” I have always said that my work was about drawing; a small drawing is as important as a large sculpture and its making is as difficult for me. » Falsely naive, the work of Alain Séchas stands out and opens our eyes, like his cat: « Forcing the viewer to see is to me the very definition of art », he says. With no complacency whatsoever.  Peace and Love shows a family with children who embody some of the typical calamities of society written on their T-shirt: “murder”, “suicide”, “gore” thus criticising the values of the generation of May 1968.","Alain Séchas was born in 1955 in Colombes, France.

Roman Ondak,"This work needs to be considered in relation to one of his performances during which people were made to queue in front of the Kunsthalle of Frankfurt in 2003 (Tate Collection). In this instance Ondak collected images of people queuing in front of all sorts of buildings in various newspapers. He then inserted these in a Slovakian newspaper without trying to give any coherence with the information in the text on the same page. The result is a fictional space with the potential for the invention of different scenarios. The theme of people queuing encourages the consideration of the relation between interior and exterior but also of exclusion. It can also be a reference to deprivation during periods of war or economic depression. In the manner of works by Felix Gonzales-Torres, the audience can take a copy of the newspaper which therefore leaves the exhibition space. The fact that the message or the artwork circulates is an integral part of the artistic gesture. People lining up behind one another also formally becomes a living sculpture. The refusal to allow the object to be recouped by the flux of liberal economy echoes the refusal of any monumentality which was used so often by authoritarian regimes.","In 2009, Roman Ondák won the Golden Lion at the Venice Biennale for Loop, the Pavilion of the Czech and Slovak Republics, for which he brought the same plant-life and trees growing outside inside. This highly considered installation epitomizes Ondák’s work. With often discreet, tongue-in-cheek, conceptual, participatory modes, he succeeds in profoundly questioning the art world and its established quirks, exhibition spaces, behaviors like queuing, labeling or various pedagogical approaches, visitor experience, any misplaced preciousness about authenticity or authorship. Various tactics (asking friends for drawings) or forms (shoelaces for instance) recur in his photographs, performances, installations, videos. Borderlines are deliberately blurred between the exhibition space and reality. This is infused by his relation to each specific project context and by his own ongoing experience of changing Eastern Europe.  Roman Ondak was born in 1966 in Zilina, Slovakia.

Roman Ondak,"As the caption purposely admits, these drawings were made by friends of Ondák’s at home in Slovakia asked to interpret places he has journeyed to.

Taking the role of a commissioner recurs regularly in Ondák’s work, other examples include Common Trip (2000) constituted with 128 elements, I’m Just Acting in It (2007) with 24 drawings, for instance.  These eight drawings were placed in variegated simple home decoration frames to create a sort of storyboard for the artist’s life. For political, personal or economic reasons, not everyone has similar possibilities for mobility. Ondák’s act of sharing his memories expands the potential impact of art for a different public, made actors on these occasions. The interpretations give different viewpoints but maintain a certain continuity, as if it is the artist’s travelogue once removed. The repetitive descriptions of a walking man have interesting parallels with Francis Alys’s two-dimensional work.","In 2009, Roman Ondák won the Golden Lion at the Venice Biennale for Loop, the Pavilion of the Czech and Slovak Republics, for which he brought the same plant-life and trees growing outside inside. This highly considered installation epitomizes Ondák’s work. With often discreet, tongue-in-cheek, conceptual, participatory modes, he succeeds in profoundly questioning the art world and its established quirks, exhibition spaces, behaviors like queuing, labeling or various pedagogical approaches, visitor experience, any misplaced preciousness about authenticity or authorship. Various tactics (asking friends for drawings) or forms (shoelaces for instance) recur in his photographs, performances, installations, videos. Borderlines are deliberately blurred between the exhibition space and reality. This is infused by his relation to each specific project context and by his own ongoing experience of changing Eastern Europe.  Roman Ondak was born in 1966 in Zilina, Slovakia.

Roman Ondak,"“A man wanders near the windows of a gallery, situated adjacent to the street. He occasionally gazes through windows into the gallery but never enters.” Passersby are numerous since these windows are by a tram stop on a busy street. It is surprising to note how few of them take any notice of this man peering repeatedly through the slightly tinted glass into an empty meeting room with no distinctive signs to be seen. It turns out this was a performance at the Kunsthaus in Graz. A annunciating drawing with the same title was shown in Ondák’s solo show More Silent Than Even at gb agency in Paris the same year; this show also included an invisible eavesdropping device. The uncomfortable connotations of surveillance, whether visual or aural, in everyday situations or art galleries, were in focus.  The camera shots following this strange act of insistent staring and squinting vary from different perspectives outdoors or from inside the space looking at him, with consequent shifts in soundscapes.  In The Stray Man‘s exercise in curiosity, nothing happens. This action in the public sphere could appear useless. But this extended, seemingly trivial, gesture is a contemporary poetic take of the act of looking, on its meaning today, its possibilities and difficulties applicable to the art world as much as to human and socio-political permissiveness or constraints at large.","In 2009, Roman Ondák won the Golden Lion at the Venice Biennale for Loop, the Pavilion of the Czech and Slovak Republics, for which he brought the same plant-life and trees growing outside inside.

Anthony McCall,"The film Line Describing a Cone was made in 1973 and it was projected for the first time at Fylkingen (Stockholm) on 30 August of the same year. This piece, which was initially screened in independent film contexts, it soon began to be shown at art museums and ended up becoming one of the key works of the artistic movement that opened up the visual arts towards cinema. With a duration of 30 minutes, the film shows the creation of a white curve being projected onto an empty space. A thin mist is introduced into the projection area, therefore the viewer can progressively see (more than a circle reflected on the wall) a large cone of light which simultaneously becomes a light sculpture into which he is invited to circulate. By allowing the viewer to immerse himself in it, and play with this strange substance, Line Describing a Cone becomes not only something made to be seen, but also something to be experienced since the viewer is absorbed into the scene and becomes part of the action. In this way, McCall recreates an inversion: by placing the public facing the projector, he reveals the entire process of kinematics and, at the same time, he destroys any possibility of illusionism, in order to create another, that of magic, poetry and wonder.","Since the 70s, the British artist Anthony McCall has continued to push the boundaries of art. Exploring the boundaries between cinema and sculpture, he uses light and time as his signature materials. His work spans across drawing, installation, and performance, one of his preferred mediums.  McCall is a key figure of British avant-garde film from the 70s. His first films retrace his outdoor performances. Experimental film in 16mm is one of his main mediums that he uses in confrontation with sculpture and performance. McCall is an indispensable reference to a younger generation of artists working in video and installation in England and abroad.Anthony McCall was born in Great Britain in 1946.

Anthony McCall,"This score is a graphic record of the detailed choreography of one of Anthony McCall’s Landscape for Fire performances. These took place between 1972-74 in the UK at the Museum of Modern Art in Oxford, Colchester School of Art, in Reading and in North Weald as well as in Sweden at Fylkingen Society of Contemporary Music and Arts, Stockholm, and in the USA at the William Patterson University, Wayne, New Jersey. Many of these events were photographed by David Kilburn and Carolee Schneemann, only one in 1972 was filmed. Dressed entirely in white, the artist and his collaborators lit braziers outdoors at nightfall, to the sound of foghorns. According to printed documentation, Subcycle 10 lasted 144 minutes between 4.42pm-7.06pm.  If one refers to another drawing dated March 1973 in the Getty Research Institute, the numbering from 0-148 are the minutes and the columns with the numbers “12, 8, 4” indicate  the time sequence. The geometric precision of these diagrams documents McCall’s specifically imagined spatial plan of interaction with unpredictable elements of fire, air and environmental conditions to create a near ritualistic event harking back to age-old traditions. The grid system formalizes the pacing or staging of this earthwork. McCall had begun his body of works drawing with light with the ‘Fire Event’ series of performances in his studio in London in 1971.","Since the 70s, the British artist Anthony McCall has continued to push the boundaries of art.

Amie Siegel,"Winter is a film installation of multiple tenses—shot in the recent past, depicting an unknown future, unfolding (and changing) in the present of the exhibition. Shot in the white-washed homes of New Zealand architect Ian Athfield, including his own communal compound high above Wellington harbor, the film suggests various temporal and cultural conditions of instability, hinting at concerns of global warming and nuclear accidents, pushing at the boundaries of science fiction, stripped of narrative explication and causal explanation.","Amie Siegel works with the cinematic image—the precise production of filmic and still images—to produce artworks that address deeper social issues. She fakes and remakes, to purposefully tell lies as a vehicle to a greater truth.

Andrea Bowers,"Bowers’ Radical Hospitality (2015) is a sculptural contradiction: its red and blue neon letters proclaim the words of the title, signaling openness and generosity, while the barbed wires that encircle the words give another message entirely. Meant to hang from the ceiling, Bowers’ neon is further weighed down by long wind chimes made of aluminum pipes and wooden wind catchers that drip unsteadily from their anchors. Poetic but frantic in its juxtapositions, Bowers’ work captures a certain paradoxical energy that echoes the current political climate—it is hopeful but hindered, cacophonous but well intentioned, uncertain but ominous.","Socially engaged and politically outspoken, Los Angeles-based artist Andrea Bowers builds her work around issues of social justice and advocacy. Her artistic practice often uses political protests and movements as sources of inspiration and content, as she draws isolated figures holding picket signs with delicate attention, or replicates the archive of a cause in the space of the gallery.

Angelica Mesiti,"Angelica Mesiti´s piece, The Calling (2013-14) is a poignant exploration of ancient human traditions evolving and adapting to the modern world. The three-channel work focuses on traditional whistling languages and shows the communities of the village of Kuskoy in Northern Turkey, the island of La Gomera in the Canary Islands, and the island of Evia, Greece, where such languages are all still in use. For these communities, whistling languages are in a process of transformation from their traditional use as tools for communication across vast lands into tourist attractions and cultural artifacts and are being taught to local school children.  Edited to evoke the particularities of this mode of communication, and its place in daily life, the work shows each community in close-up detail as well as in long shots that describe the distance over which their whistling must carry. Subtitles in the native languages and in English allow understanding, but the intrusion of other noises is analogous to how the language is now less commonly heard.  The three channels are projected at large scale in a dark space, drawing on the conventions of cinema presentation but expanding this to become a more physical experience, seeking to engage the viewer in an experience beyond the audiovisual.","Splitting her time between Sydney and Paris, Angelica Mesiti is a video, performance, and installation artist of Italian origin. Her work unravels the personal histories and living cultures of particular locales through an anthropological lens versed in cinematic conventions and performance languages. She is especially interested in the way sounds, gestures, non-verbal languages, and rhythmic traditions are preserved, migrate across distances, and cohere diverse communities. Her past video and sound installations have explored the translation of traditional Asian and Muslim music in Parisian and Australian cities, the mediation and projections of dance performances in immigrant communities, and Algerian political ballad renditions of Classic rock music.",The Calling,Asia,"['language.n.01', 'island.n.01', 'community.n.01', 'traditional.a.01', 'experience.n.01', 'exploration.n.01', 'artifact.n.01', 'presentation.n.01', 'transformation.n.01', 'native.a.01', 'ancient.s.01', 'school.n.01', 'distance.n.01', 'tool.n.01', 'land.n.01', 'local.a.01', 'daily.s.01', 'modern.a.01', 'scale.n.01', 'physical.a.01', 'child.n.01', 'shooting.n.01', 'tradition.n.01', 'manner.n.01', 'cultural.a.01']","['community.n.01', 'globalization.n.01', 'culture.n.01', 'tradition.n.01', 'identity.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/image_angelica_mesiti_the_calling.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/image_angelica_mesiti_the_calling-300x200.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/the-calling/,"['Individual_Personal/14.956954156954163', 'Cultural/4.871794871794871', 'Society/4.601398601398602']","['Individual_Personal', 'Cultural', 'Society']",24.430147630147637,"['Identity/4.797979797979798', 'Mind/4.774358974358975', 'Culture/3.269230769230769']","['Identity', 'Mind', 'Culture']",12.841569541569541,"['Cultural/33.24156954156954', 'Individual_Personal/17.32380952380953', 'Society/13.730336330336332']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Society']",64.2957153957154,"['Arts/8.760372960372962', 'Culture/8.3', 'Media/7.176923076923076']","['Arts', 'Culture', 'Media']",24.23729603729604,1.0,0.3333333333333333
Beatriz Santiago Muñoz,"La cabeza mató a todos or “The Head that Killed Everyone”, is a mixing of indigenous mythologies with present-day characters, geographies, and culture in Puerto Rico. The title refers to how a shooting star was (in local mythology) interpreted as a head without a body, crossing the sky, signaling the arrival of chaos and destruction. The actor in the video, Michelle Nonó, is in touch with native plants—she’s a medicinal botanist but also a cultural activist. She hosts cultural events in her house, in a primarily Afro-Caribbean and post-industrial area called Carolina.  Cats are very common on the island of Puerto Rico, and in this video, the cat is cast as a mythological entity, capable of world-altering transformations. The soundtrack further blends time and space as it alternates between a track from the Peruvian punk band, Los Psychos, and the chirping and croaking music of the coquí frog that populate Puerto Rico’s wet landscapes. These elements combine to imagine a spell that can destroy military industries, confronting the complexities of this system on a poetic plane rather than a rational one.","Beatriz Santiago Muñoz lives and works in San Juan, Puerto Rico. Her approach to making films and videos resembles the careful approach of an ethnographer. She learns about the place, the site of the film, its cultural histories and local mythologies.

Benvenuto Chavajay Gonzalez,"Jardín (2013) refers to environmental destruction, specifically the preponderance of disposable plastics, as well as Medellín’s long history of dangerous conflict; it was once considered the most violent city in the world because of the drug trafficking there. This floor sculpture consists of shoes made of river stones, strung with flip-flop straps. Here, Chavajay plays the natural (found stones) against the synthetic (plastic), heavy against light, hard against soft, revealing the irony of their fusion and the impossibility of their alleged function as shoes. By transforming these heavy, clunky rocks into shoes, the artist alludes to the paralysis and weight under which the city of Medellín has long suffered.","Benvenuto Chavajay’s body of work includes sculpture, interventions into objects, installation, performance, and painting. The artist rearranges unconventional materials in ways that often appear innocuous at first glance, but are in fact deeply political, based on the cancellation of objects as they relate to the violence that surrounds them. Chavajay draws inspiration from many different contextual realities in order to produce his work. His creative process alludes to the present context not only in Guatemala, but also in Latin America and beyond, in the sense that one part always affects the whole.",Jardin,Unspecified,"['rock.n.01', 'plastic.n.01', 'city.n.01', 'river.n.01', 'destruction.n.01', 'light.a.01', 'function.n.01', 'floor.n.01', 'see.v.05', 'natural.a.01', 'sculpture.n.01', 'history.n.01']","['environment.n.01', 'pollution.n.01', 'waste.n.01', 'plastic.n.01', 'conflict.n.01', 'paralysis.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/benvenuto_chavajay_gonzalez_jardin_1_web.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/benvenuto_chavajay_gonzalez_jardin_1_web-300x199.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/jardin/,"['Material_Physical/5.494505494505494', 'Politics/5.174358974358975', 'Society/3.5025641025641026']","['Material_Physical', 'Politics', 'Society']",14.17142857142857,"['Environmental/4.637362637362637', 'Power/4.241025641025641', 'Violence/1.7333333333333334']","['Environmental', 'Power', 'Violence']",10.611721611721613,"['Material_Physical/17.029373894079782', 'Society/9.625976240298492', 'Cultural/4.920751633986928']","['Material_Physical', 'Society', 'Cultural']",31.576101768365202,"['Space/6.346153846153846', 'Arts/4.14297385620915', 'Land/4.002614379084967']","['Space', 'Arts', 'Land']",14.491742081447963,0.6666666666666666,0.0
Brian Bress,"Blindseye Arranger (Max) (2013) features a greyscale arrangement of rudimentary shapes layered atop one another like a dense cluster of wood block prints, the juxtaposition of sharp lines and acute angles creating an abstracted field of rectangular and triangulated forms composed as if in a cubist landscape. As the video progresses, however, a disembodied hand begins to move these forms, animating a pictorial frame that was previously still. The hand – ostensibly the “arranger” of the works title – functions as a metonym of the artist’s hand, quite literally bringing a motionless work to life. The hand in Blindseye Arranger, though, also signals a shift towards the performative, functioning as a reminder that all works of art are created by a maker’s “hand” and, in such, are never fully separate from the context in which they are made. Bress’s gesture towards interdisciplinarity in his work, by extension, signals an important moment in which questions of medium-specificity give way to more trenchant inquiries into notions of authorship and creative process.","Although originally trained in filmmaking and animation, Brian Bress explores the influence of pictorial traditions on contemporary media-based practices. His single-shot videos utilize painterly effects such as geometric abstraction to create visual compositions that blur presumed boundaries between contemporary media-based work and more traditional disciplines such as sculpture and painting. His work is deliberately processed-based and his videos, by extension, explore how visual motifs “evolve” over time through as a viewer engages with a given object or image. Animated figures and actors – such as disembodied hands – disrupt these seemingly still frames, repositioning these works in the context of film while also suggesting the presence of the artist’s hand. Bress’s videos may seem overtly indebted to creative lineages, and his images frequently border on the surreal. But in gesturing towards past works, his videos signal the emergence of creative practices enabled through technological advancements while also offering a meditation on a durational aesthetics privileged in media-based work.",Blindseye Arranger (Max),Americas,"['hand.n.01', 'block.n.01', 'wood.n.01', 'field.n.01', 'agreement.n.04', 'creative.a.01', 'shift.n.01', 'form.n.01', 'print.n.01', 'function.n.01', 'line.n.01', 'compose.v.01', 'gesture.n.01', 'frame.n.01', 'shape.n.01', 'impression.n.01', 'moment.n.01', 'context.n.01', 'procedure.n.01', 'question.n.01', 'make.v.03', 'landscape.n.01', 'life.n.01', 'video.n.01']","['abstraction.n.01', 'hand.n.01', 'pictorial.n.01', 'geometry.n.01', 'context.n.01', 'artist.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/imb_brian_bress_blindseye_arranger_max_low_rez.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/imb_brian_bress_blindseye_arranger_max_low_rez-207x300.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/blindseye-arranger/,"['Cultural/5.800835421888053', 'Individual_Personal/5.758516483516484', 'Politics/1.6421052631578947']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Politics']",13.201457168562431,"['Mind/2.5142857142857142', 'Values/2.475', 'Design/1.7777777777777777']","['Mind', 'Values', 'Design']",6.767063492063492,"['Cultural/18.325396825396833', 'Society/15.457698166986098', 'Individual_Personal/14.438887093298863']","['Cultural', 'Society', 'Individual_Personal']",48.22198208568179,"['Economy/4.8067155067155065', 'Design/4.107692307692307', 'Spirituality/4.090476190476191']","['Economy', 'Design', 'Spirituality']",13.004884004884005,0.6666666666666666,0.3333333333333333
Cao Fei,"Cao Fei’s video La Town, 2014 depicts a mythical metropolis that has been destroyed by unknown forces. Although the damage is obvious, as the camera navigates across the elaborate, handmade dioramas, the inhabitants of La Town carry on with their activities and the normality of everyday life pervades. As the film progresses, the latent chaos and violence begin to emanate from every corner of the miniature city: a bloody briefcase left on the ground, a kidnapping scene, an axe murderer on the loose, a ferocious man-eating octopus—all rendering the darkness of this new post-apocalyptic world order.  La Town is ridden with traces of a consumer capitalist society—such as a well known German supermarket, a McDonald’s, flickering neon Shell signs, and a movie theater playing Gone with the Wind—deliberately coupled with references to different cultures and time periods in order to make it impossible to decipher a time and place. These cultural signifiers are a reflection of Fei’s own experience of the paradoxes brought by a regime that incubated a voracious hyper-capitalism in her native Guangzhou, also known as “the world’s factory.”  The dialogue in the film is based on the 1957 movie Hiroshima Mon Amour directed by Alain Resnais, with a screenplay written by Marguerite Duras. In both films we hear an ambiguous and nonlinear conversation in French where a man and a woman contradict each other, extenuating the discrepancy between what is and isn’t real.  As with her virtual works La Town uses the city to address Fei’s ongoing concerns: the inaccuracy of memory, forgetfulness, and a tacit existentialism as we search for a greater truth in different facets of everyday life.","Cao Fei is a celebrated multimedia artist known for works that focus on the interplay between real and fictional worlds. Working across photography, performance, video, and digital media, her practice vividly reflects the zeitgeist of the late twentieth century and the role that image production has played in shaping youth culture in a digital era. Influenced by an array of forms of global pop culture—from Cantonese Pop and Japanese anime to American hip-hop—a common thread in her practice is the merging of everyday life with new forms of technology as a means to unveil society’s unfulfilled desires.  Her pivotal film Whose Utopia, for example, showcases assembly line workers in a factory in China as they act out their aspirations in a backdrop of industrial machinery. In another key body of work, RMB City, Fei created a virtual city through the platform Second Life—an online space that mimics ‘the real world’—as a vehicle to express ideas that relate to modernization, capitalism, and consumer culture. Through these constructed worlds, Fei presents a profound meditation on the boundaries between the real and the fantastic and the sense of alienation that drives new generations to increasingly experience the world behind the veneer of their Avatars. For Fei, the digital world is an expression of our human condition, and as such, an avenue to reflect on these emerging forms of social consciousness.",La Town,Asia,"['town.n.01', 'everyday.s.01 life.n.01', 'movie.n.01', 'city.n.01', 'everyday.s.01', 'factory.n.01', 'theater.n.01', 'force.n.01', 'dialogue.n.01', 'unknown.a.01', 'ongoing.s.01', 'dark.n.01', 'native.a.01', 'bring.v.01', 'life.n.01', 'activity.n.01', 'conversation.n.01', 'land.n.04', 'trace.n.01', 'time.n.01', 'aspect.n.01', 'sign.n.01', 'write.v.01', 'contemplation.n.02', 'time_period.n.01']","['virtual.s.01', 'existentialism.n.01', 'picture.n.01', 'municipality.n.01', 'city.n.03']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/img_la_town-center_plaza.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/img_la_town-center_plaza-300x200.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/la-town/,"['Society/6.183726567550097', 'Cultural/6.033169934640522', 'Material_Physical/5.030672268907563']","['Society', 'Cultural', 'Material_Physical']",17.24756877109818,"['Urbanization/5.414495798319328', 'Land/5.030672268907563', 'Design/2.5359477124183005']","['Urbanization', 'Land', 'Design']",12.981115779645192,"['Cultural/30.105242083338066', 'Society/23.725502601973197', 'Material_Physical/19.525730478671658']","['Cultural', 'Society', 'Material_Physical']",73.35647516398292,"['Arts/12.756835811247578', 'Urbanization/8.747913524384112', 'Time/7.213786213786213']","['Arts', 'Urbanization', 'Time']",28.718535549417904,1.0,0.3333333333333333
Carla Zaccagnini,"This series of photographs, Sobre la igualdad y las diferencias: casas gemelas (On Equality and Differences: Twin Houses), taken in Havana in 2005, belongs to a wider group of works that the artist has been developing over many years, generally titled Bifurcaciones y encrucijadas (Forking Paths and Crossroads). These works are dedicated to the collection and investigation of similarities and singularities. Some focus on things that are supposed or expected to be identical, but end up being slightly different. Others focus on things that ought to be different but somehow obey similar principles. The photographs examine these issues on a temporal basis, for instance depicting groups of houses that were built to be the same but have been changed over the years according to the tastes, needs, and capabilities of their inhabitants. A playful, poetic quality underlies these displacements and juxtapositions, signifying subtle transformations of the everyday.","Carla Zaccagnini combines historical research with a variety of media and techniques. From drawing to installation, performance, text, video, exhibition curating, and written criticism, Zaccagnini investigates cultural exchange and social displacement, as well as the transformation of the symbolic value of images in contemporary culture. Zaccagnini views these multiple activities as mutually constitutive forms of inquiry that overlap to form a holistic, conceptually driven art practice. Often working by recontextualizing existing objects and ideas, she prompts viewers to question the limitations of language and representation, the fallibility of perception, and the construction of knowledge.  Zaccagnini is part of a generation of Latin American artists that have addressed the political history of the continent and, more specifically but not exclusively, the history of Brazil. Having delved into the history of slavery, the influence of European aesthetics in Brazilian art, and its assimilation by indigenous cultures, Zaccagnini uses art as a conceptual instrument to undo the construction of history and the production of knowledge.",Sobre la igualdad y las diferencias: casas gemelas,Americas,"['house.n.01', 'probe.n.01', 'transformation.n.01', 'change.v.01', 'photograph.n.01', 'poetic.a.01', 'quality.n.01', 'issue.n.01', 'construct.v.01', 'series.n.01']","['everyday.s.01', 'culture.n.01', 'society.n.01', 'economy.n.01', 'similarity.n.01', 'singularity.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/carla_zaccagnini_sobre_la_igualdad_y_las_diferencias_casas_gemelas.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/carla_zaccagnini_sobre_la_igualdad_y_las_diferencias_casas_gemelas-300x218.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/sobre-igualdad-diferencias/,"['Society/4.511655011655012', 'Material_Physical/1.8', 'Politics/0.8']","['Society', 'Material_Physical', 'Politics']",7.111655011655012,"['Economy/2.6025641025641026', 'Community/1.9090909090909092', 'Time/1.0']","['Economy', 'Community', 'Time']",5.511655011655012,"['Individual_Personal/16.93637865402572', 'Cultural/11.700716440422324', 'Material_Physical/5.808547008547008']","['Individual_Personal', 'Cultural', 'Material_Physical']",34.44564210299505,"['Mind/5.597888386123681', 'Arts/4.248529411764705', 'Values/3.907692307692308']","['Mind', 'Arts', 'Values']",13.754110105580693,0.3333333333333333,0.0

Pavel Wolberg,"A young settler girl, dressed in a bridal outfit for Purim, stands in a street in Hebron waiting, perhaps for her parents or other children to join her. In the background three soldiers scan the buildings and the rooftops for threatening presences. Turning her back to the soldiers, the little girl pays no attention to what surrounds her. Her gaze is directed beyond the picture’s frame. The soldiers do not seem to protect the child either, their eyes and guns are pointed in different directions. Two of them seem to be looking at the camera, which brings the picture back to a certain reality. In this photograph, as in the one with the disguised boy, there is a palpable tension and the contradictory representation of two realties: the war and childhood innocence. Moreover, in both photographs, the costume implies fiction and may suggest that feelings are hidden. Wolberg’s images portray violence, but very differently than what you expect from war reportage, for example the terrible images of children during the Vietnam war like the famous photograph by Kim Phuc. Pavel Wolberg observes the incongruities of life in Israel, where trying to carry on a « normal » life can sometime create absurd situations.","Pavel Wolberg studied photography at the Camera Obscura School of Art in Tel Aviv. Since graduating he has pursued two careers simultaneously: that of a field photographer for newspapers and as an artist. This duality is reflected in his work, but it is also at the heart of much of the most interesting photography being made now. Like artists such as Wolfgang Tillmans, Wolberg blurs the boundaries between fine art photography, reportage and fashion photography. Living in a theatre of conflict, Pavel Wolberg records the tensions, absurdities and insecurities of daily life in both Israel and the Occupied territories. His work (re)presents the complex times in which we live and, although rooted in the Israeli situation, his images represent incongruities the world over.Pavel Wolberg was born in Leningrad in 1966 and he immigrated to Israel in 1973.

Kelley Walker,"The triptych Black Star Press is part of the series ‘The Black Star Press project’ initiated in 2004 by the American artist Kelley Walker. The images in this series are taken from a photo essay on the struggle for civil rights in Alabama, directed by Charles Moore in 1962 (and published by the magazine ‘Life’) which showed the repression of the black population and persistent inequalities in the southern United States. The title “Black Star Press” is taken from the name of the news agency where Charles Moore worked, and it refers to the young black man shot fighting for the rights of his community. Of those recovered images, scanned and screen printed, Walker poured dark chocolate, white and milk chocolate in the manner of a dripping. This symbolic gesture breaks down the documentary nature of the image and expresses heightened subjectivity of Abstract Expressionism, which opposes the action a cold mechanical representation of the image. Reactivating the potential opened up by Andy Warhol’s artistic offerings in the series ‘Race Riot’, “Black Star Press” echoes the entire tradition of image appropriation, from Pop Art and Appropriationism itself.","While the pop art movement and the appropriationist movement essentially concerned the iconography of popular media, like newspapers to TV commercials, Kelley Walker is interested in the media system as a whole. His work frequently questions the notions of author and audience, originality and authenticity, reproduction and the circulation of images. The artist plays with the usual distribution system of the work of art.  The image contained therein can indeed be reproduced endlessly and printed in various formats according to wishes of the buyer, as exemplified in the work Shema (2003). Demonstrating that there is more ways than one to escape the rehearsal process, Untitled (2003) is a steel plate of the recycling logo superimposed over an image. For Walker, it is no longer necessary to appropriate ideas, objects, images but to recycle them: the perpetual recycling of codes and systems inherent in advertising. But also of history, politics, and art in the United States.  Kelley Walker was born in 1969 in Columbus, Georgia.

Colectivo Tercerunquinto,"BF15 is a preparatory study for the collective’s intervention at the BF15 gallery in Mexico, near Monterrey. It includes a photograph, a collage, sketches and notes. The intervention consists in the seamless extension of the wall of the BF15 gallery beyond the property boundaries, invading the sidewalk and the street, entering public space. The artists highlight the permeability between public, professional and private space. Through these actions, they question the definition of those notions, and become involved in negotiations, making connections and exchanges. Interrogating the role of each space and its function is central to their work.","Tercerunquinto develops work related to the urban, the boundaries between public and private space. By introducing simple signs or gestures – the construction of a concrete slab, displacement of a portion of bitumen on the side of the road, encroachement of grass on a parking, the three artists interrogate public space as the place of possibilities. Their interventions give users an active status with the power to decide on their own environment. For the Hong Kong architecture biennale, the collective intervened in the exhibition spaces. The intervention consisted in constructing a wall which integrated the word ‘Anarchitecture’ (anarchy + architecture) by omitting certain bricks. Therefore it was as if the word had perforated the wall. Through the wall, the spectator could see the city and its transformations. Thus the spectator was invited to develop his critical outlook on the environment.The collective – formed in 1998 – is composed by Julio Castro, born in 1976, Gabriel Cazares, born in 1978, and Rolando Flores, born in 1975.

Christiane Baumgartner,"Baumgartner’s own excursion into war imagery is the diptych Formation. She was watching a television documentary on the Second World War, was struck by the extraordinary nature of the colour film and decided to video it. The two frames she isolated depict the shadows the planes cast on the ground and the sun glinting off their steel fuselages. Of course the next few frames showed the destruction they wrought as they strafed a target in Germany but Baumgartner was not interested in that aspect. It was the beauty of the images she found compelling: the tones, the shapes and the speed.  Images from World War Two, when seen from the distance of years and the safety of the home, have become mythical. They depict stories handed down with which a younger generation feels little personal connection. They no longer have the power to shock and have entered the realm of the aesthetic. […] The images we see through the refractive television screen are aestheticised and their meaning is somewhat neutralised. [The artist] disarms them even further by means of Photoshop and, then, by translating the image into woodcut. The final image is far removed from feeling, from experiencing the destructive capacity of the war machines. »  Excerpt from Jeremy Lewison, « At the Still Point of the Turning World », in Christiane Baumgartner, edited by Johan Deumens, 2007, p. 43","Christiane Baumgartner’s practice is related to her origins. Born in Germany’s historic capital of book publishing, she trained as a printmaker and has also made books. Woodcut is her preferred medium.In her works she travels backwards in the history of image technologies, first by making videos or photographs that she transfers herself onto large-framed boards, then by carving and printing them. The topics depicted are often transport infrastructures (roads, tunnels, airports…) which evoke traveling, circulation in space, and also play a major role in armed conflicts; these urban landscapes in which concrete predominates, evince the alienation of the modern environment, the boredom of long journeys and embody the fanaticism for speed accompanying the development of transport in the contemporary era.

Michel Auder,"The Town consists of footage taken from Auder’s studio of the skyline of New York, tracking planes as they fly across the sky and pass tall buildings. At the time of recording, like all of this films, there was no particular intent. However, in the aftermath of 9/11, this film becomes prescient and ominously prophetic. Planes fly by and through buildings, including the World Trade Centre and while the film begins with a soundtrack, the final footage of fog swirling around the WTC is silent. Although never made as a memorial to the destruction of the WTC this film cannot help but become one. It is the most extraordinary piece of serendipity and a tribute to Auder’s methods of filming random moments that retrospectively acquire meaning.","Michel Auder was born in 1945 in Soissons, France.

Michel Auder,"Talking Head is a short film in black and white of Auder’s daughter Alexandra, hidden behind a hemp plant, playing with a plastic wrapper and babbling in an imaginative way. The viewer is uncertain whether Alexandra knows she is being filmed but given that Auder was constantly filming she was probably oblivious to it. Her statements make little sense to the outsider : ‘The thing never came back again. It wasn’t the same thing. That thing. Was nice.’ But to her it seems to represent some imaginative narrative connected to the peeling back of the plastic wrapper. The viewer of the film feels as though he has been admitted to her innermost mind, the unconscious. The informal documentary nature of Auder’s films has had wide repercussions in terms of contemporary film making. This kind of low-tech practice informs the work of such artists as Steve McQueen and Gillian Wearing and ran parallel to the fly on the wall practices of documentary filmmakers in the 1970s such as Ken Loach. The acquisition of works by Auder provides a reference point for a number of works in the Kadist collection (Laumann, McAlpine, Menick etc).","Michel Auder was born in 1945 in Soissons, France.

Yto Barrada,"In this photographic series, Yto Barrada was interested in the logos of the buses that travel between North Africa and Europe. They become like abstract paintings that recall Modernist formal experimentation. They are somehow symptomatic of the circulation of goods and people that is made to sound so abstract. The commentaries of two Moroccan children that accompany the images reminds us about the fact that everyday candidates to emigration try to spot these buses that will cross the Strait. Many children hide there and undertake long illicit journeys. As is often the case in her photographs, Yto Barrada chose a square format that conveys immobility despite the reference to transport. They are flat, without perspective, like the numerous walls visible in her work. The loss of depth in things ensures that any pain consciously stays separate from the beauty of the images.","Yto Barrada is an artist of Morrocan origin who has worked for many years in Tangier, a urbanized border town influenced by the West. Her work is articulated around Tangier’s territory and raises questions on the city’s rapid infrastructural changes associated with economical development and real-estate speculation.  Tangier, in a sense, is at the point of becoming a Moroccan Costa del Sol. “Le project du détroit,” a work that has granted her international visibility, consists of videos and series of photographs, in attempt to describe a city of transit and in transition. For a considerable amount of time, Tangier was the gate to Europe that Schengen closed in 1991. A meeting point between Europe and Africa, the strait of Gibraltar became a “larger Morrocan cemetary” that refugees and asylum seekers used to cross from Tangier. Her work reminds one of documentary reporting, yet with a poetic vision, far from exoticism and spectacle.

Yto Barrada,"This photograph is part of the series titled “Iris Tingitana project” (2007) focusing on the disappearance of the iris. If Yto Barrada was initially interested in the architectural heritage of the city, today the core of her research focuses on risks around landscape and its heritage. The iris, found bordering the city, carries the name of the city, and is an emblem of Tangier. This flower grows in the most improbable and resistant situations such as vacant land and construction sites. Now on roadsides, next to iris flowers grow geraniums, like in standardized European resorts. This photograph depicts a child proudly sporting a crown made of iris flowers in a deprived area. In traditional iconography, and especially in Catholic traditions, the iris, like the lily, is a royal symbol. This child reminds us of portraits from seventeenth century Dutch painting, in which flowers symbolize vanity. Despite the intense and interrogative look of the boy, one cannot help but think of the boy in a symbolized garden of Eden – a paradise lost.","Yto Barrada is an artist of Morrocan origin who has worked for many years in Tangier, a urbanized border town influenced by the West.

Jochen Lempert,"A Trip to the North Sea is composed of 6 parts. The images show a rough sea, with huge waves. The waves foam, swell and collapse. The large size of the images, like posters, engulf the spectator’s body, as if captured by the wave which becomes sonorous in its surge, rolling from one image to the other. The clear horizon traces a line, a continuity between each image. The waves are rendered like an all over. Their massiveness accentuates the sculptural aspect of the subject. In the printing process, the artist has recomposed the image, aligning the horizon so all aspects coincide. The process remains simple and contributes to the construction of a mental and archetypal image. The vision Lempert proposes is that of an intact and virgin world. All his work has an ephemeral, ungraspable, touching feel.","Trained as a biologist, Lempert’s subjects are nature and its inhabitants while also being very influenced by the art of his time: seriality, archiving, abstraction, all-over painting. His approach to reality is empirical. At all times one is aware of his wonder and profound amazement with the world. He records traces, the natural geometries of the world, and thus defines his place between photography, drawing, abstraction and the object. His work in subtle. This is not to do with the definition of his images, but on the contrary with their absence of clarity, the choice made between the reality of the shot and the work in the lab. A double process occurs: what is captured and becoming in the presumed images is modified by the printing. There is some sort of loss, an incomplete image. The materiality of the paper plays a role in this approximate definition introducing a poor patina, entertaining the attitude of unlearning and starting again. Therefore the question can be posed differently: making visible something that is escaping, decomposing and going elsewhere.Jochen Lempert was born in Moers, Germany, in 1958. he lives and works in Hamburg.",Un voyage en Mer du Nord ( A trip to the North Sea),Europe,"['wave.n.01', 'sea.n.01', 'aspect.n.01', 'image.n.01', 'procedure.n.01', 'poster.n.01', 'ephemeral.s.01', 'sculptural.a.01', 'vision.n.01', 'compose.v.01', 'simple.a.01', 'construction.n.01', 'subject.n.01', 'spectator.n.01', 'body.n.01']","['horizon.n.01', 'pure.s.04', 'wave.n.01', 'archetypal.s.01', 'ephemeral.s.01', 'continuity.n.03']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/img-683.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/img-683-300x219.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/un-voyage-en-mer-du-nord-a-trip-to-the-north-sea/,['Material_Physical/4.292307692307692'],['Material_Physical'],4.292307692307692,"['Time/2.3692307692307697', 'Immaterial/1.0', 'Physics/0.9230769230769231']","['Time', 'Immaterial', 'Physics']",4.292307692307693,"['Cultural/15.995934784170084', 'Material_Physical/13.891208791208795', 'Individual_Personal/10.833699633699636']","['Cultural', 'Material_Physical', 'Individual_Personal']",40.72084320907852,"['Space/6.346153846153846', 'Arts/5.534640522875817', 'Culture/3.964835164835165']","['Space', 'Arts', 'Culture']",15.845629533864827,0.5,0.0
Bruno Serralongue,"The half-length portrait of Joe Shirley presents a man with a great presence, wearing several items that point to ancestral Native American culture. In this photograph, which is relatively poor in information, the projection screen in the background acts as a clue about the event: Bruno Serralongue went to the second phase of the ‘Sommet Mondial sur la Société de l’Information’ (or SMSI, World Summit on Information Society, in Tunis in November 2005). This portrait echoes another picture in the same series (Native Peoples Claim Their Right to Participate in the Information Society) in which Joe Shirley is just a silhouette amongst the speakers, whereas here he occupies the entire frame. The strange impression that the model is posing for press photographers – and not for an artist making a portrait – reveals the staging of the event along the lines of the ‘discourse of order’ (Michel Foucault). In addition, the painting format introduces a different reading to that of a press photo. The artist questions the point of view and the space: “What distance should be adopted to face an event ? […] In my view, when using a different tool like a photographic chamber, there is necessarily a greater distance. […] In documentary photography, there is this idea of adjusting the distance, so that one cannot see too much or too little. One needs to find a distance within which the photographed person or event can ‘speak’”.","Bruno Serralongue integrates his practice into the processes of production and distribution of information via images. He attends very diverse events such as regional festivities (Les fêtes, 1994), the universal exhibition in Hanover (Expo 2000), a neoliberal meeting in Chiapas (Encuentro, Chiapas, 1996), with a rhythm which is different to that of a press photo-journalist. With no specific accreditation and by using a camera that requires very long exposures, his standpoint is of course different. The artist questions commissions and working methods – he then integrates these as modalities for producing  images by instatinga distance between the subject and the personal stylistic signature. According to his protocol for the Faits divers series (1993- 1995), the photographer works on very allusive information extracted from t miscellaneous news item section of the ‘Nice-Matin’ newspaper; Serralongue goes to the place mentioned two days after the event. As if emptied, the images create a space for representation that did not exist before. In the context of a crisis of representation and the scripting of reality by press images, “the document is a response to the world of images on the actual territory of the images, it is perhaps the only way to oppose the monopoly of spectacle”, according to Michel Poivert (in his analysis of the documentary style in “La photographie contemporaine”,  2002), “the photographer and the spectator are reconciled by the adoption of the ordinary man’s viewpoint”.","Mr Joe Shrigley Jr, président de la nation Navajo",Europe,"['distance.n.01', 'event.n.01', 'native.a.01', 'portrayal.n.01', 'society.n.01', 'position.n.03', 'reading.n.01', 'discourse.n.01', 'strange.a.01', 'phase.n.01', 'tool.n.01', 'documentary.a.01', 'projection.n.01', 'photograph.n.01', 'photographer.n.01', 'format.n.01', 'picture.n.01', 'model.n.01', 'line.n.01', 'screen.n.01', 'background.n.01', 'american.a.01', 'presence.n.01', 'person.n.01', 'frame.n.01']","['navaho.n.01', 'portraiture.n.02', 'stagy.s.01', 'pose.n.02', 'frame.v.02', 'conference.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/img-365.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/img-365-232x300.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/mr-joe-shrigley-jr-president-de-la-nation-navajo/,"['Cultural/1.6421052631578947', 'Society/0.7692307692307693']","['Cultural', 'Society']",2.411336032388664,"['Arts/1.6421052631578947', 'Community/0.7692307692307693']","['Arts', 'Community']",2.411336032388664,"['Individual_Personal/13.893212669683262', 'Cultural/13.24924585218703', 'Society/11.399145299145301']","['Individual_Personal', 'Cultural', 'Society']",38.54160382101559,"['Arts/4.9192307692307695', 'Politics/4.0', 'Materiality/3.5256410256410255']","['Arts', 'Politics', 'Materiality']",12.444871794871794,0.8,0.4
Peter Friedl,"Map 1969-2005, a poster glued on the wall, questions space in its relation to geography. On a red background, a free-hand drawing in white refers to the aesthetics of maps. Map 1969-2005 is not an accurate map of the United States, but one that combines mapping, overlaps and merges diverse elements: Oregon, Lake Superior, San Francisco, Cheyenne, Missouri, Zuni, Navajo, Texas, Shawee, Colorado, Piegan, Canada, Miami, etc. In the same space the map’s original design and representation is also shown, yet each requires a specific reading, and each reading is different. Map 1969-2005 is a critical image which by introducing geographical and identity shifts plays out exploration myths of the United States territory.","Many of the projects of Peter Friedl, in their heterogeneous medium and style, function as intersection points between countless lines of thought and reference, creating a vast didactic network where dialogues simultaneously merge with critical logic and narrative.

Peter Friedl,"Peter Friedl’s projects place aesthetic questions within an expanded field that takes into account the social, political and philosophical context. This textile piece quotes and diverts a flag with a red background and the central star of the Kurdistan National Liberation Front (ERNK, a military organization linked to PKK, founded in 1985 and disbanded in 2000), and not the national flag of Kurdistan. The artist became interested as from 1994, when the town of Lice was destroyed by the Turkish army and the PKK was expelled from Germany. This flag got a lot of visibility in the media at the time.  The artist has lightened the red and emptied the central circle to question the role of the emblem as a representative sign for a group. Lightening and cutting out are ways of reclaiming all the complexities. New Kurdish Flag 01 considers the status of the flag as an object of propaganda which was activated in the streets during different performances, before being ‘museified’ and placed in a frame in 2005, in a semantic slip. The fabric acquires a political dimension. Is it still possible to reactivate it in the real world?","Many of the projects of Peter Friedl, in their heterogeneous medium and style, function as intersection points between countless lines of thought and reference, creating a vast didactic network where dialogues simultaneously merge with critical logic and narrative.

Guillaume Leblon,"Puits (“Wells”) is a circle made ??of raw earth elements, at the scale of Leblon’s hands. In this work, Guillaume Leblon reclaims the tactility of clay, as a classical material of sculpture, which we can also see in his other works like Raum (2006), National Monument (2006), and Notes (2007). Puits (“Wells”) suggests a universe of the past, like the 700 wells of Mohenjo-daro, the thriving Indus city from the second millennium BC (Pakistan, cf. Link). In the case of Guillaume Leblon, this form is a reminiscencence, as developed by Aby Warburg, whose forms survive and reappear through the ages and places. This work points toward the idea of wells, mimicking their shapes, while questioning their use. This well is not functional and resists to water. Its hole is replaced by a space enclosed with brick. Maybe the well is a metaphor of the opening artist’s studio to the world? The artist introduces a sense of fragility between unstable equilibrium and the threat of collapse.","Guillaume Leblon is a sculptor, who questions the vocabulary of forms – he uses material encompassing  copper alloy of tin and zinc, flows like water, lightning, smoke, and space to express notions of landscape and weightlessness. During an exhibition at Sonsbeek in the Netherlands, Leblon proposed the work “Temps libre” (Free Time) (2001), a jump from three floors of the tallest building in Arnhem. His works function as indices, in form, references or emotions, creating a very special atmosphere which reflects his interest in modernism that he defines as “a total art that includes a real time.” In Leblon’s work, perception of space by the viewer is often precarious and ambiguous due to subtle alterations.

Allen Ruppersberg,"Untitled (City Limits) is a series of five black-and-white photographs of road signs, specifically the signs demarcating city limits of several small towns in California. Taken outside Palmdale, Littlerock, Pearlblossom, Victorville, and Barstow, towns where the population does not exceed 20,000, Ruppersberg’s trip follows the outskirts of Los Angeles. As with many of his other photographic series, the artist here inserted into each view a constant element that disturbs the otherwise quiet scenes: a hand holding an open magazine. By pairing each road sign with magazines as diverse as Playboy, Look, Hulk comics, Arizona Highways or Rona Barrett’s Hollywood, Ruppersberg teases the viewer to find a connection between the two.","Like many of his peers in the 1960s, Allen Ruppersberg recognized art as existing not in the isolated realm of aesthetics, but as a practice with a clear political and critical potential, one inextricably immersed in an economic system. Ruppersberg took as source material diverse items stemming from a distinct American form of popular culture of the mid-twentieth century. However, it was perhaps his particular use of everyday rituals to explore different cultural mythologies and narratives that separated him from many conceptual artists of his generation. For a period between the late 1960s and early 1970s, Ruppersberg developed several series of photographs that privileged a certain kind of neutrality, stillness, and emptiness that resembled the seemingly authorless images of mass-produced postcards or calendars. But in his works the artist often hid distinct clues, like an unopened newspaper left on an unmade bed in a hotel room. In this series Ruppersberg was also interested in the suggestion of narrative or uncanny storytelling through the juxtaposition or sequential arrangement of images.",Untitled (City Limits),Americas,"['sign.n.01', 'magazine.n.01', 'city.n.01', 'population.n.01', 'los_angeles.n.01', 'town.n.01', 'california.n.01', 'component.n.01', 'connection.n.01', 'changeless.s.02', 'series.n.01', 'hand.n.01', 'photographic.a.01', 'position.n.03', 'scene.n.01', 'spectator.n.01', 'photograph.n.01']","['popular.s.04', 'sign.n.02', 'juxtaposition.n.01', 'photography.n.01', 'hand.n.01', 'los_angeles.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/allen_ruppersberg_-_untitled_city_limits_1970.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/allen_ruppersberg_-_untitled_city_limits_1970-300x81.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/untitled-city-limits/,"['Society/4.272514619883041', 'Cultural/3.5473684210526315', 'Politics/2.377777777777778']","['Society', 'Cultural', 'Politics']",10.197660818713452,"['Urbanization/2.672514619883041', 'Arts/1.9473684210526314', 'Land/1.5555555555555556']","['Urbanization', 'Arts', 'Land']",6.175438596491228,"['Society/16.190391514230523', 'Cultural/14.949627039104092', 'Material_Physical/14.45895281189399']","['Society', 'Cultural', 'Material_Physical']",45.59897136522861,"['Land/12.668476621417799', 'Urbanization/12.044359768198778', 'Media/6.959786721706227']","['Land', 'Urbanization', 'Media']",31.672623111322803,0.6666666666666666,0.6666666666666666
Alexis Smith,"In 8 Ball Surfboard (1995),Alexis Smith combines her long-term interests in California culture and conceptual assemblage. The surfboard, an emblem of Southern California, emblazoned with the image of an eight-ball, references numerous tropes and clichés of American popular culture, specifically subcultures related to pool halls, surfing, and beaches. Indeed, this model-scale surfboard may be a future pop-culture relic, referencing a particular surfer or era of board design.","At a moment when Minimalism and Conceptual Art collided, Southern California-based Alexis Smith began working with discarded street signs, matchbooks, movie posters, and other detritus to become one of the pioneers of conceptual assemblage. Her cryptic comments on the cloudy morality of American culture are derived from pop cultural references including political figures like Richard Nixon, Hollywood films, and pop musicians.

Mario Garcia Torres,"Mario Garcia Torres films a game of Charades among professional actors guessing the former North Korean dictator’s favorite Hollywood films. Indeed rather surprisingly Kim seems to have had a huge collection of Western videos and he published a book called “On the art of the Cinema” in 1973. As the final acknowledgments indicate, Garcia Torres’s work was produced following in depth research, consulting information given by director Shin Sang-ok who has been kidnapped by Kim in 1978, as well as Jerrold Post (The George Washington University) and Timothy Savage (Nautilus Institute for Security and Sustainable Development).The motion pictures represented are, in order of appearance: Doctor Zhivago by Craig Wadlin; First Blood by Misti Traya; From Russia with Love by Vanessa Koellner; You Only Live Twice by Nate Harrison; The Godfather by Roberto Medina; Friday the 13th by Gregory Arlt; and Gone With The Wind by Margarita Reyes. Cinematographer: Kevin Merz.  The old-fashioned grainy black and white film stock bring a certain distance or an artistic remove from these otherwise known actors in TV series or cinema. The approach is typically modest in presentation in the mode of performance art of the 1970s. The actors’ gestures hilariously attempt to represent a film at great speed. The success rate seems high as they evoke the popular culture they are charged to communicate. Strangely effectively they also capture general hints of violence and melodrama in the dictator’s taste.","With the care and seriousness of an art historian, Mario Garcia Torres creatively composes with immateriality and his discovery of conceptual practices dating back to the 1960s. His playful work infuses new meanings and continuity into art and some of its lesser known stories. To date artists like Michael Asher, Robert Barry, Alighiero Boetti, Martin Kippenberger have for instance been inspirations for various interventions by Garcia Torres, thus prolonging, and simultaneously slightly modifying, their contexts in present and future times.

Mario Garcia Torres,"Mario Garcia Torres imagines cinematic devices to replay stories occasionally forgotten by Conceptual art. For him, this is a way of rethinking the tradition in a more personal way, to have a grip on events of recent history and examine them with a curiosity, both critical and sensual. The artist emphasizes the fact that new ideas and meanings may arise from these archaeological narratives. Until it Makes Sense seems to say that faced with the confrontation of heterogeneous elements, coherence can only emerge with the passage of time. It suggests yet that sensitive and personal observation, after all, is a valid form of interpretation of history.  Mario Garcia Torres makes his work from already written stories, whether real or fictitious. He creates new narratives based on documents and works of “mythical” artists such as Robert Barry, John Baldessari, or lesser known artists such as Allen Smithee or Oscar Neuestern.","With the care and seriousness of an art historian, Mario Garcia Torres creatively composes with immateriality and his discovery of conceptual practices dating back to the 1960s.

Raphaël Zarka,"This photograph seems to be awaiting meaning, it more or less evokes known elements without really identifying with them completely: a motorway interchange, a bridge, an electric pylon… In fact this is the end of the tracks of the Aérotrain, a wheelless monorail invented by Jean Bertin in the 1970s, which acts like ‘a fossil of movement on landscape scale’, as explained by the artist. This fragmentary place is meant to activate physical movement. It also activates the spectator’s imagination.  The series Les formes du repos is a photographic collection of concrete geometric objects, in undefinable spaces, set aside or in waiting. The photographic document allows the display of these ‘involuntary sculptures’. Paired down geometric forms (whether modernist or futurist) appear tensely in their decor (a field, several buildings on the horizon). This photograph is key in the series, since the tracks are no longer an object but a space. The positioning of the shot emphasises the fragmentary character, the tracks only lead to an empty decor. Observing this defunct functionality, the artist, with Vincent Lamouroux, created Pentacycle (a mono terrain vehicle, 2002) in order to reactivate movement on this ruin.","Raphaël Zarka presents himself as a sculptor and artist-collector. He scrutinises the contemporary world to draw up a genealogy of geometric forms. He is constantly noticing Plato’s polyhedrons (speculative geometric forms) materialized in concrete breakwaters (Les formes du repos series/The Forms of Rest). His work highlights the fact that the ‘survival of forms’ (Aby Warburg) takes place in today’s world in functional and concrete environments. The artist acts with the curiosity of the Renaissance humanists in their studio (Studiolo, 2008), but he has adopted a thinking structure where dichotomies and the methodological boundaries of Art History are banned. With his typical transversal approach, the artist has started theoretical research into the urban practice that is skateboard by publishing essays and realizing artistic projects. In Riding modern art  (Lyon Biennale, 2007), he confronts photographs of the skaters performing on public sculptures with a sculpture by Katarzyna Kobro. The confrontation underlines that the movement is either of aesthetic potential for modern sculpture or a mechanical realization for skating. “It’s almost an insult to the mysteries of the world to think that we could invent anything or that we needed to invent anything”; this quote by Borgès has become the artist’s motto.Raphaël Zarka was born in 1957 in Montpellier, France.

Hana Miletic,"Incompatibles (Unitas) is made from discarded samples of the yarns that are exported from Croatia and not actually available in the local market. The textile industry in former Yugoslavia has essentially closed down under pressure from Indian and Chinese industries and as a result of the botched privatization of once state-owned factories. There is only one factory remaining in Zagreb producing these yarns. Certain colors are only available on the export market and it is these that Hana Miletic uses here, a political gesture pointing out the inequity of the system. These relics of a bygone industry represent both memory and the loss of work under a new political system, one which impacted older women workers most heavily.  Miletic’s interest in weaving has matured into a highly politicized activity as well as a one that implicates body and mind. The artist sees weaving as a labor which moves from head to hand and back again.  The design of Incompatibles (Unitas) resembles the utopian abstract works of the 1930s although they were not in her mind as she made it. Rather the process was to use the yarns in the order in which they came out of the bag and to make each rectangle as large as the amount of the yarn permitted. Thus the design is really quite random but determined by a systematic process. Miletic also recognizes their resemblance to Bauhaus type images.","Hana Miletic is a Croatian artist living in Brussels with a background in documentary and street photography. She uses photography as the basis for woven works, the fabric is an abstraction of what she has witnessed, a bringing of the outside inside, and serves as a kind of act of care and repair.  Born in Zagreb in 1982 Miletic’s family were refugees from the former Yugoslavia. Her work resonates with memories of Croatia as well as dealing with the history of its culture. Her weaving practice began in 2015, she was both drawn to the precedence taken by material gestures over conceptual thinking and the intergenerational contact she had with women of different ages and cultural backgrounds. While primarily a craft and an artistic practice, weaving also has a social dimension, conceptually it allowed her to consider the metaphorical implications of binding together and repairing, both physically and psychologically. Although historically weaving is a male and a female occupation it is commonly associated with women’s work. Her adoption of this process for making art thus brings to the fore a feminist agenda, using a process normally associated with applied art to make fine art.",Incompatibles (Unitas),Europe,"['factory.n.01', 'mind.n.01', 'market.n.01', 'design.n.01', 'procedure.n.01', 'political.a.01', 'loss.n.01', 'chinese.a.01', 'type.n.01', 'activity.n.01', 'abstraction.n.01', 'worker.n.01', 'head.n.01', 'local.a.01', 'fabric.n.01', 'colors.n.01', 'gesture.n.01', 'hand.n.01', 'consequence.n.01', 'woman.n.01', 'memory.n.01', 'body.n.01']","['industry.n.01', 'fabric.n.01', 'labor.n.01', 'inequality.n.01', 'politics.n.01', 'loss.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/20.PA_.EU_.2.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/20.PA_.EU_.2-200x300.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/incompatibles-unitas/,"['Cultural/7.2735042735042725', 'Society/6.743589743589744', 'Politics/2.8333333333333335']","['Cultural', 'Society', 'Politics']",16.85042735042735,"['Economy/4.371794871794872', 'Arts/2.5384615384615383', 'Media/2.4273504273504276']","['Economy', 'Arts', 'Media']",9.337606837606838,"['Cultural/51.23263990911047', 'Society/30.39827131932396', 'Individual_Personal/28.317208771620543']","['Cultural', 'Society', 'Individual_Personal']",109.94812000005497,"['Arts/16.95661854485384', 'Spirituality/10.80879120879121', 'Culture/8.971428571428572']","['Arts', 'Spirituality', 'Culture']",36.73683832507362,0.6666666666666666,0.3333333333333333
Natsuko Uchino,"Squid Currency is a series of 13 non-calibrated double-sided tin coins made using a casting technique dating back to Neolithic times where cuttlebones (squid bones) were carved by hand and then used as a mold. Natsuko Uchino draws on research into tin mining  across the world, which takes place largely in China and Bangladesh as well as in Potosi, Bolivia where silver has been depleted due to the production of coins and other ornate riches during the 16th century Spanish Empire. Tin has a low melting point and is easily up-cycled from vessels such as measuring cups and kitchen utensils found at yard sales.  Money is a surrogate for value and it serves as a unit to measure exchange within a community that accepts transactions by sharing it. The common usage of money does not always mean that everything in the world is commensurate, nor does currency need to be based on accumulation, competition or capitalism. A bank is only formed when a community creates it and economy is the dynamics of relations in a community that shares resources, manufacturing, services and bonds. The blatant inequality pervasive in our present economy is a reflection of the history of domination, violence and usurpation, but the essence of exchange and the mesh of social fabric give way to a number of other intricate structures and infrastructures. (show many other intricate structures). There are alternative and complementary currencies that attempt to manifest such diversity that may or may not be pegged to central monies;  the squid currency is sold as an artwork traded at a price contingent to its production context. Its circulation value is indeterminate and should be prescribed by its usage.","Natsuko Uchino is an artist whose practice is defined by its interaction with agriculture and craft; she relocated to a rural area of France in order to have an open air studio where she could produce ceramics and work with natural elements such as mushrooms and fermentation techniques and where she collaborates with farms.

Basma Alsharif,"Deep Sleep draws from historical avant-garde cinema to produce a poetic, sound-based meditation following brainwave-generating binaural beats. The dreamlike video is filmed among abandoned ruins in Malta, Athens, and Gaza, connecting the three locations in an attempt to convey the experience of being in Gaza from these monumental sites. Colorful flickering lights, sun, earth, stone, rock, sky, and water inundate the scenes, and the rhythmic sounds of waves, chimes, and footsteps remain. Restricted from visiting Gaza for a period, Basma Alsharif practiced self-hypnosis in an attempt to locate herself in several places at once and filmed this work while in a trance state. Appearing in the video as her own double, dressed in all-white, she walks through unidentifiable ruins, holding a recording device. The artist points to various details in a scene, her finger filling the frame, urging us to take a closer look. The meditative shots coax the viewer into the rhythmic flow of the film where time and temporalities, borders and distinguishable geographies collapse into one another. Here, Gaza is called upon, reinvented through the lens of the artist’s personal relationship to Palestine. The film is what the artist calls an “invitation to move from the corporeal self to the cinema space in a collective act of bi-location that transcends the limits of geographical borders and plays with the fallibility of memory.","Basma Alsharif is an artist and filmmaker of Palestinian origin, born in Kuwait, and raised between France, the US and the Gaza Strip. She developed her practice nomadically between Chicago, Cairo, Beirut, Sharjah, Amman, the Gaza Strip and Paris, and her personal experience is reflected in her work, which she defines as presenting a non-geographically based subjective viewpoint. Her practice sits at the intersection of cinema and installation and focuses upon the human condition as it relates to various landscapes, environments and geographies. According to critic Suzy Halajian, Alsharif’s videos “evoke a longing for a home that might never be resolved or might have never existed.” Her works attempt to find understanding amid complex places, overdetermined by political upheaval, as a means of trying to imagine various ways of existing in such spaces.

Dawoud Bey,"On 15 September 1963 members of the Ku Klux Klan blew up the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham Alabama up using dynamite. Four African American girls were killed, and 22 other people were injured. Two African American boys were killed in related violence that day. No prosecutions were pursued until 1977 when one member of the Klan was convicted for first-degree murder. In 2001 and 2002 two other men were further convicted. The bombing of this church marked a turning point in the struggle for civil rights and contributed to support for the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. In 2005 American photographer Dawoud Bey visited Birmingham Alabama to research the possibility of commemorating this terrible event. He spent the next seven years meeting people in the community and in 2012 began a series of paired portraits of members of the church community. Each pair depicts a young person of the age of those killed in 1963 and a person of the age those children would have been fifty years later in 2013. Bey’s photographs make immediately apparent the loss of four young lives and the passage of stolen time, while at the same time highlighting issues of on-going racism and violence against the African American population; Bey began this project the same year that Tryvon Martin was killed.  Half of the photographs were taken at the Bethel Baptist Church and the other half at the Birmingham Museum of Art, an institution that restricted admission to African Americans to once a week through the early 1960s. In one of the 16 diptychs Timothy Huffman and Ira Sims are photographed in the museum in front of Rococo paintings by Christophe Huet from circa 1750 depicting picnic scenes with coffee and hot chocolate being served by monkeys, a code for African slaves. The contrast between the frivolity of the scene and the racist message with the seriousness of the sitters and the reason for their depiction is significant.","Dawoud Bey is an American photographer and professor and Distinguished Artist at Columbia College Chicago. Growing up in the 1960s, he was deeply influenced by the activist slogan “if you’re not part of the solution, you’re part of the problem”, describing his work as an attempt to contest assumptions and challenge the status quo. Hailed as the acclaimed portraits of African American life, his earliest work depicted the day-to-day of people living in Harlem, later photographing processes of gentrification in the neighborhood with the series ‘Harlem Redux’. Throughout his practice he has often featured young people and describes his methodology as one that is collaborative in nature and rooted in community. Pushing the political potential of photography and producing images from a highly subjective perspective, he sees portraiture as a practice of identification and empathy, with the medium acting as an accessible means of describing human experience.",Timothy Huffman and Ira Sims,Americas,"['african.a.01', 'american.a.01', 'age.n.01', 'passage.n.01', 'community.n.01', 'violence.n.01', 'person.n.01', 'museum.n.01', 'people.n.01', 'scene.n.01', 'message.n.01', 'male_child.n.01', 'population.n.01', 'american.n.01', 'ongoing.s.01', 'loss.n.01', 'struggle.n.01', 'institution.n.01', 'pair.n.01', 'photograph.n.01', 'time.n.01', 'day.n.01', 'contrast.n.01', 'possibility.n.01', 'issue.n.01']","['racism.n.01', 'violence.n.01', 'murder.n.01', 'civil_right.n.01', 'african-american.n.01', 'loss.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/19.PA_.NA_.16.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/19.PA_.NA_.16-300x196.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/timothy-huffman-and-ira-sims/,"['Politics/8.092469451548736', 'Society/6.5489235061613575', 'Material_Physical/1.582608695652174']","['Politics', 'Society', 'Material_Physical']",16.224001653362265,"['Violence/4.861176470588235', 'Inequality/3.594771241830065', 'Activism/2.69769820971867']","['Violence', 'Inequality', 'Activism']",11.15364592213697,"['Society/23.163043638508043', 'Individual_Personal/22.544896933132232', 'Material_Physical/14.947319493372127']","['Society', 'Individual_Personal', 'Material_Physical']",60.655260065012406,"['Mind/6.374358974358975', 'Spirituality/5.784615384615385', 'Time/5.122552447552448']","['Mind', 'Spirituality', 'Time']",17.28152680652681,0.6666666666666666,0.0
Mandy El-Sayegh,"Mandy El Sayegh grew up in a medicalized environment, surrounded by anatomy, biology and psychology publications; these books inspire the figures that appear throughout her work. The work White Grounds 12 offers a bird’s eye view of a skull open from the front, belonging to a patient diagnosed with dementia who is suffering from self-inflicted wounds. White Grounds 10 depicts the body of an injured worker in China. What takes center stage in this work is not the political subtext, but the representation of flesh, turning blue, like death. At the opening of the exhibition “White Grounds” at Betonsalon in Paris, where this work was first exhibited, visitors were invited to walk across the latex canvasses that carpeted the ground. The odor of paint, the feeling of moving across the sticky surface added something organic and visceral to the experience. El-Sayegh cites the artist Kader Attia and his artistic ambition to “repair the world” as integral to her practice. She also notes her father’s native Gaza as an unresolved trauma transmitted through generations. For the artist, painting becomes a material for exchange through which sensitivity becomes a register of intelligibility, inciting the viewer to reconstruct the fragments of the exhibition and the world themself.","Beginning with rigorous research and resulting in a wide range of media, from layered paintings, to installation, diagram, sculpture, sound and video, El-Sayegh’s work is about systems of bodily, linguistic and political order among others, and their disintegration. This gives way to an exploration of the poetry that emerges from a reworking of such codes, and the new meanings that are created. Her work is both personal and political, often merging found references from the media, as well as intimate details, such as her father’s calligraphy work within the same space. In an interview with The Guardian, the artist describes her work as “a forensic thing. I’m laying it all out. I want everything in there, the political, the sexual… there is a terror in excess.” These fragmented units are then reconsidered as a coherent whole.",White Grounds 14,Europe,"['white.n.01', 'father.n.01', 'eye.n.01', 'visitor.n.01', 'injury.n.01', 'native.a.01', 'fragment.n.01', 'phase.n.01', 'land.n.04', 'exchange.n.01', 'coevals.n.01', 'worker.n.01', 'china.n.01', 'paris.n.01', 'paint.n.01', 'death.n.01', 'book.n.01', 'environment.n.01', 'center.n.01', 'surface.n.01', 'representation.n.01', 'position.n.03', 'practice.n.01', 'figure.n.01', 'experience.n.01']","['anatomy.n.01', 'body.n.01', 'medicine.n.01', 'biology.n.01', 'psychology.n.01', 'health.n.02']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Mandy-El-Sayegh-22White-Grounds-1422-2019.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Mandy-El-Sayegh-22White-Grounds-1422-2019-200x300.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/white-grounds-14/,"['Material_Physical/25.539269959636094', 'Cultural/13.052366209641754', 'Individual_Personal/10.143237245845942']","['Material_Physical', 'Cultural', 'Individual_Personal']",48.734873415123786,"['Physics/11.314612008891185', 'Space/8.746944359987838', 'Technology/4.1687159074155975']","['Physics', 'Space', 'Technology']",24.23027227629462,"['Cultural/30.149661570313754', 'Society/25.672760899231495', 'Individual_Personal/24.717929438982083']","['Cultural', 'Society', 'Individual_Personal']",80.54035190852733,"['Culture/9.998809523809525', 'Media/8.189621489621489', 'Land/6.584718205770836']","['Culture', 'Media', 'Land']",24.77314921920185,0.6666666666666666,0.0
Marguerite Humeau,"This work forms part of a project that draws upon research into the use of psychoactive substances present in animal brains during the Paleolithic period. Bolstered by research by archaeologist Bethe Hagens, the artist explores the hypothesis that prehistoric shamans consumed the psychoactive parts of animal brains in order to achieve spiritual ecstasy and that the found figurines, reproduced by Marguerite Humeau, are an archival remnant of these experiences. The so-called “Venus figurines” take the form of ambiguous female forms and despite their exaggerated gendered traits, the onus is instead upon the resemblance to the ingested animal brains that led to their production. The digitally rendered figures are made of different materials, including limestone, alabaster and bronze. Shameless Venus, A 20 years old Female Human has Ingested a Mole’s Brain is the smallest of all sculptures in the series.","Marguerite Humeau’s work begins with intensive research that calls upon the expertise of various specialists including historians, anthropologists, paleontologists, zoologists, linguists or conspiracy theorists. The artist seeks not only to draw together these interdisciplinary fields and push them to their limits, but also to enrich this research through artistic processes that reconsider historiography in a way that responds to our present moment. This straddling of time and space alludes to an attempt to place different worlds in dialogue with one another, exploring the possibilities of communication and knowledge gaps. Myths and patterns within the history of mankind are central to her work, leading her to invent speculative narratives that resuscitate the past as a means of interpreting current attitudes towards life, death and technology. Spanning sound, sculpture, painting, drawing and illustration, previous projects have included the resurrection of Cleopatra’s voice and the enactment of a funeral rite for an advanced elephant herd.","Shameless Venus, A 20-year-old female human has ingested a mole’s brain",Europe,"['animal.n.01', 'religious.s.01', 'form.n.01', 'production.n.01', 'time_period.n.01', 'undertaking.n.01', 'figure.n.01', 'experience.n.01', 'material.n.01', 'sculpture.n.01', 'series.n.01']","['biology.n.01', 'spirituality.n.02', 'ritual.n.01', 'tradition.n.01', 'culture.n.01', 'anthropology.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Marguerite-Humeau-22Shameless-Venus-A-20-year-old-female-human-has-ingested-a-mole’s-brain22-2018-.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Marguerite-Humeau-22Shameless-Venus-A-20-year-old-female-human-has-ingested-a-mole’s-brain22-2018--300x200.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/shameless-venus-a-20-year-old-female-human-has-ingested-a-moles-brain/,"['Cultural/16.487471317811877', 'Individual_Personal/13.757601361262694', 'Material_Physical/11.153393466436945']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Material_Physical']",41.39846614551152,"['Culture/6.854664942900237', 'Mind/6.416464237516869', 'Physics/5.676980990024468']","['Culture', 'Mind', 'Physics']",18.948110170441574,"['Cultural/16.12148423471953', 'Individual_Personal/12.069144890197524', 'Politics/11.75799755799756']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Politics']",39.948626682914615,"['Arts/6.538578251813546', 'Culture/5.577777777777778', 'Power/5.476923076923077']","['Arts', 'Culture', 'Power']",17.5932791065144,0.6666666666666666,0.3333333333333333
Kapwani Kiwanga,"Flowers for Africa is a protocol project started in 2014, which questions the material that history is made of: its fragility, its infallibility, its visibility and its hierarchy. Starting with extensive research into visual archives related to decolonization, Kapwani Kiwanga focused upon the floral arrangements that were omnipresent in the images of ceremonies or events related to the independence of African countries. In the work’s protocol, the artist enumerates the bouquet’s components in order to reproduce them as found in the images. The bouquet’s reinterpretation is open, highlighting the possibilities to give new meanings to these historical events, serving as a reminder of the fallibility and incomplete fixity of the archive.","Kapwani Kiwanga is a contemporary researcher, installation, video, photography, sound and performance artist currently based in Paris. Kiwanga’s work confuses truth and fiction in order to unsettle hegemonic narratives and create spaces in which marginal discourse can flourish. As a trained anthropologist and social scientist, the artist occupies the role of a researcher in her projects. Afrofuturism, anti-colonial struggle and its memory, scientific methodologies, belief systems, vernacular and popular culture are but some of the research areas which inspire her practice. Favoring research, scientific enquiry and unexplored anecdotes, Kiwanga’s practice is concerned less with objecthood than historical narratives and challenging patriarchal notions of truth and being. Throughout her practice, Kiwanga looks at the architecture of historical memory, exploring specifically the immateriality of symbols and structures. Her minimalist visual language, the research of Kiwanga is carefully curated and pertinently displayed, mixed with both sensible cynicism and a liberatory lyricism.",Flowers for Africa : Namibia,Europe,"['event.n.01', 'african.a.01', 'agreement.n.04', 'component.n.01', 'africa.n.01', 'possibility.n.01', 'state.n.04', 'historical.a.01', 'image.n.01', 'meaning.n.01', 'undertaking.n.01', 'ocular.a.02', 'question.n.01', 'material.n.01', 'history.n.01']","['decolonization.n.01', 'ceremony.n.01', 'independence.n.01', 'history.n.01', 'hegemony.n.01', 'society.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Kapwani-Kiwanga-22-.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Kapwani-Kiwanga-22--300x300.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/flowers-for-africa-namibia/,"['Society/3.0', 'Politics/2.402564102564103', 'Material_Physical/1.709090909090909']","['Society', 'Politics', 'Material_Physical']",7.111655011655012,"['Politics/2.402564102564103', 'Time/1.709090909090909', 'Community/1.0']","['Politics', 'Time', 'Community']",5.111655011655012,"['Individual_Personal/14.593381927669858', 'Material_Physical/8.724231324231324', 'Cultural/8.03076923076923']","['Individual_Personal', 'Material_Physical', 'Cultural']",31.348382482670413,"['Mind/6.470604395604395', 'Time/4.144011544011544', 'Culture/3.1076923076923078']","['Mind', 'Time', 'Culture']",13.722308247308247,0.3333333333333333,0.3333333333333333
Uriel Orlow,"The series The Memory of Trees is specifically about trees, and what trees have witnessed in South Africa: for example, trees that were used as locations for slave trading, or trees that was during the anti-Apartheid struggle as a kind of identifier for a safe house for activists who were fleeing from security forces. Trees and plants are connected and embedded in history; but not only as witnesses and onlookers; Orlow tries to think about plants as active agents in history. This perspective allows for an oblique view of history especially when it comes to specific loci of violence such as in South Africa. This alternative approach to history was useful to the artist as not only a different means of addressing precise events, but also as a way of engaging with the environment and considering how the environment engages with us. From here a longer-term temporality, an organic, cyclical, multi-dimensional and multi-species time opens up. This ancient milkwood tree is over 500 years old and stands in Cape Town’s post-industrial suburb of Woodstock. It was in this spot, on Cape Town’s original beachfront, in 1510, that the Portuguese explorer, Dom Francisco de Almeida and his men were attacked and killed by the Khoikhoi, who revenged cattle raids, abductions and extortion. In later centuries, the tree became known as the Old Slave Tree of Woodstock. Under its shade, slave masters bartered away humans and from its branches ‘disobedient’ slaves were hung. In the early 19th century the tree was renamed ‘The Treaty Tree’ to commemorate the start of the second British occupation of the Cape. It was here, following their defeat in 1806, that Dutch forces signed capitulation conditions, effectively transferring control of the Cape to Britain.","In his research-based and process-oriented practice Uriel Orlow’s work is concerned with “spatial manifestations of memory, blind spots of representation and forms of haunting”. He is best known for his single-screen film works, lecture performances and modular, multi-media installations that focus on specific locations and micro-histories, bringing different image regimes and narrative modes into dialogue. Orlow’s major work Theatrum Botanicum (2015–2017) considers the botanical world as a stage for politics. According to the artist the project aims to show “plants as witnesses and actors in history, as dynamic agents linking nature and humans, tradition and modernity – across various geographies, histories and knowledge systems.” Addressing questions of ‘botanical nationalism’ and other legacies of colonialism, plant migration, bio-piracy, flower diplomacy under apartheid, the role of classification and naming of plants as well as the garden planted by Mandela and his fellow inmates in Robben Island prison, this project highlights the research intensive nature of his work and the various aesthetic strategies that he employs as a means of unveiling obfuscated power relations and the narrativization of history.","Milkwood Tree, Cape Town",Europe,"['tree.n.01', 'south_africa.n.01', 'south.n.01 africa.n.01', 'force.n.01', 'town.n.01', 'plant.n.01', 'africa.n.01', 'south.n.01', 'century.n.01', 'history.n.01', 'environment.n.01', 'position.n.03', 'world.n.08', 'witness.n.01', 'occupation.n.01', 'militant.n.01', 'british.a.01', 'control.n.01', 'struggle.n.01', 'ancient.s.01', 'specific.a.01', 'location.n.01', 'approach.n.01', 'house.n.01', 'original.s.01']","['bondage.n.02', 'oppression.n.01', 'trauma.n.02', 'activism.n.01', 'history.n.01', 'violence.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/19.PA_.EU_.18.png,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/19.PA_.EU_.18-300x239.png,https://kadist.org/work/milkwood-tree-cape-town/,"['Society/9.707776537188302', 'Politics/8.571945701357466', 'Individual_Personal/4.083516483516483']","['Society', 'Politics', 'Individual_Personal']",22.36323872206225,"['Violence/4.698319327731092', 'Power/3.107692307692308', 'Activism/2.7411764705882353']","['Violence', 'Power', 'Activism']",10.547188106011635,"['Material_Physical/31.279573677096906', 'Society/23.10939632263162', 'Cultural/16.551501585789513']","['Material_Physical', 'Society', 'Cultural']",70.94047158551804,"['Land/22.74581854334177', 'Urbanization/8.1925465057818', 'History/6.033333333333333']","['Land', 'Urbanization', 'History']",36.9716983824569,0.3333333333333333,0.0
Frida Orupabo,"The archival images used by Frida Orupabo in her collages trace stereotyped representations of race, gender, sexuality and violence. Her works are developed through a process of decontextualization of such imagery, layering and recomposing, playing with new narratives. In this work she focuses on memory and what might be triggered in the viewer. Often her work features bodies and limbs, however in this work, colonial violence is evoked through the animal’s skins that are taken as trophies. Presented in this format, they can also be read like maps alluding to the landscape or analyzed through their surgical compositions.","A central element of Frida Orupabo’s practice is her digital archive, storing images from both the media and from her personal life on her Instagram account, later transforming them into analogue collages. She is a trained sociologist and a self-taught artist and uses her collages to create new narratives and play with meaning.

Didem Pekün,"The black-and-white projection, Araf by Didem Pekün, begins, as a lithe man stands high up in the middle of the grand, rebuilt 16th-century Ottoman bridge in Mostar, in Bosnia and Herzegovina. In very slow motion, he soars through the air like a bird in a graceful dive. We never see him land. The essayistic road movie is the diary of a ghostly character, Nayia, who travels between Srebrenica, Sarajevo, and Mostar in Bosnia. She has been in exile since the war and returns for the 22nd memorial of the Srebrenica genocide. Narrated through the interweaving of diary notes and the myth of Icarus and Daedalus, the film speaks of home and exile, memory and the land. Nayia reads the story of Icarus not as one of failure, but of ambition to see the other side of exile, as the film embraces the paradoxes of the poetry of the land with the logistical static of the post-war condition.","Didem Pekün is a media artist, who divides her time between Berlin and Istanbul. Her work may be described as reminiscent of the American video maker, poet, and gay rights activist Marlon Riggs (1957–1994). His deeply personal and emotional videos tested the conventions of the media essay, a form that attempts to unravel the complexities of current political events. Pekün, like Riggs, has blurred the line between narrative essay and fact-based documentary. In her case, she has crafted something that is both temporal and primordial.  For nearly two decades Pekün has managed to stitch together a peripatetic life, much like other international artists of our time. Born in Istanbul, where she attended a French high school, from she was an avid music enthusiast and record collector an early age. Starting in her teens, she worked as a DJ in Istanbul’s underground music-dance club scene. Her early music experience had an impact on her video editing style, echoing her early DJ practice.

The portability of López’s methods, along with his personal approach to collecting information from his personal journeys, has become a trademark of his installations.

Brody Condon,"Future Gestalt re-imagines a large-scale sculpture “Smoke” by Tony Smith as embodying a futuristic intelligence that communicates with a group of communitarians undergoing experimental psychotherapy. Future Gestalt is not a video of a performance, rather, it is a documentation of the last of four unscripted sessions of guided participation led by the artist. Through the title and form, the sessions suggest Gestalt therapy, promoted as a form of personal transformation in California at the Esalen Institute.  The sculpture “Smoke” was conceived in 1967, but fabricated after the artist’s death in 2005 and is permanently installed at LACMA in Los Angeles. It “reflects the artist’s [Smith’s] lifelong exploration of patterns in organic life,” but its sleek painted black aluminum exterior also suggests a science-fiction spacecraft or supercomputer. Condon recognizes these implications and casts it as a character, a processed and distorted version of his own voice.","Brody Conlon is an American (born 1974 in Mexico) based in Berlin. He constructs situations to explore human experience, often involving synthesis of role-playing and collective, participatory performance.

Miljohn Ruperto,"Acting Exercise: Demon Possession is a video by Miljohn Ruperto that addresses notions of performativity, the self, and collective truth. Set in an empty, derelict room with nothing but an old mattress on the floor, the film features a series of actors independently performing a demonic possession, or at least their interpretation of what one would look like. Although each reenactment is slightly different, actor after actor, the viewer is confronted with a common thread: a near archetypal response that binds them all together. Hysterical laughter, a sinister voice, sudden movements, exaltation, moaning, pain, difficulty breathing and speaking, loss of the self—all form part of the satanic repertoire, and point towards our shared perception of the fictitious concept. Implicit in Ruperto’s acting exercise is a questioning of the notion of ‘objective truth’ set in contrast with the consensus of an agreed, subjective truth that we have socially constructed, and which we collectively share.","Based in Los Angeles, Miljohn Ruperto is a cross-disciplinary artist working across photography, cinema, performance, and digital animation. His work refers to historical and anecdotal occurrences, and speculates on the nature of assumed facts and the construction of truth. Often involving replicas, modified versions, and enactments—including Chinese-made reproductions of Caspar David Friedrich’s ‘The Monk by the Sea;’ modified images based on the 15th century Voynich Manuscript; or reworked footage of Filipino actress Isabel Rosario Cooper—Ruperto takes cultural and historical references and untethers them from their original context to challenge our perception and generate something altogether new. Ruperto’s work is often informed by his collaborations with experts from other disciplines including Dutch animator Aimée de Jongh, neuroscientist and engineer Rajan Bhattacharyya, photographer Ulrik Heltoft among others. Through a richness and diversity of lenses, and preferencing the obscure, mysterious and the magical, his work challenges fixed conceptions of truth and history, and instead speaks of an indeterminacy and subjectivity of experience that renders truth and fiction near indistinguishable.",Acting Exercise: Demon Possession,Asia,"['actor.n.01', 'impression.n.01', 'confront.v.01', 'loss.n.01', 'percept.n.01', 'common.a.01', 'put.v.01', 'floor.n.01', 'contrast.n.01', 'voice.n.01', 'interpretation.n.01', 'concept.n.01', 'corporate.s.03', 'set.n.01', 'construct.v.01', 'motion.n.03', 'spectator.n.01', 'movie.n.01', 'video.n.01', 'series.n.01']","['devil.n.02', 'fiction.n.01', 'truth.n.01', 'objective.a.01', 'original.n.02', 'subjectivity.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/miljohn_ruperto_excorcism_still_1_web.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/miljohn_ruperto_excorcism_still_1_web-300x169.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/acting-exercise-demon-possession/,"['Cultural/8.656501831501831', 'Individual_Personal/4.252777777777778', 'Material_Physical/1.6']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Material_Physical']",14.50927960927961,"['Fantasy/5.491666666666667', 'Mind/1.8', 'Spirituality/1.6527777777777777']","['Fantasy', 'Mind', 'Spirituality']",8.944444444444445,"['Cultural/25.047364073834665', 'Individual_Personal/19.84542124542125', 'Politics/7.269281045751633']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Politics']",52.16206636500755,"['Culture/9.230769230769232', 'Values/8.504761904761905', 'Mind/8.483516483516485']","['Culture', 'Values', 'Mind']",26.219047619047622,0.6666666666666666,0.3333333333333333
Petra Cortright,"In her 2011 webcam video, Sickhands, Cortright poses before her in-computer camera, as her hands, hair, and body begin waving and rippling vertically across the screen, distorted by software effects. Capitalizing and commenting on the ubiquity of homemade video, the short film replicates with banal proximity the amateur special effects that thrive on the web. This rather cliched visual trick recalls a funhouse mirror, or, perhaps more aligned with Cortright’s frame of reference, a dream-sequence cue from after-school 90s television.

John Houck,"John Houck’s brown- , sienna- and golden-toned composition, Untitled #185, 65, 535 combinations of a 2×2 grid, 16 colors, features densely packed lines of color moving diagonally across the creased page. Houck uses a series of self-designed software programs to create these intricate grids of color and line, riffing off of Sol LeWitt, perhaps, in a digital age. Houck takes the output of these programs and then manipulates them manually, creasing the pages of the index print, and then re-photographing them. In the end, this series of Aggregates—as the series is called—presents a synthesis of digital and analogue methods that toy with the 2-dimensional grid that underpins an entire digital world.","An MFA graduate from UCLA, John Houck works primarily in the medium of photography and specializes in still-life vignettes. To make his works, Houck arranges an object on a sheet of paper, photographs, and prints it, then places that print back into a new composition, repeating the process again and again until arriving at an aggregate image.

Shahzia Sikander,"Sikander’sapplication of ink is nearly translucent in Tone Deaf Brass. Depicting a warrior holding what seems to be a bazooka, or perhaps a trombone while the American flag flutters above, Tone Deaf Brass is a commentary on Pakistani-American relations. The bazooka, AK-47 or trombone is attached to four parachutes—one discretely billowing and mirroring the American flag. The artist’s depiction is ambiguous: there is no logical conclusion to the action being witnessed. Commenting on the paradox of geopolitical relations between what is contemporaneously and erroneously described as the homogenous Middle East and the leader of the Free World (America),Sikander’s play of identity and symbols is framed with a delicate floral border, in which the warrior floats.","Shahzia Sikander is known for her richly layered and intricately detailed graphite, ink, and gouache paintings. She studied miniature painting in the late 1980s at the National College of Art in Lahore, Pakistan, with the forms and techniques of Indo-Persian miniatures heavily influencing her approach. Sikander’s practice explores the concepts of “East” and “West,” using traditional strategies of storytelling and themes of popular mythology to deconstruct the postcolonial legacy of the Indo-Persian region. In 2001, Sikander began to employ digital animation to create video works based on her drawings. Her practice traverses painting, drawing, animation, installation, and video, to radically rearticulate the tradition of miniature painting. Sikhander uses the technique to address contemporary issues, including the Western fear of Islam, the globalization of Western ways of living, and gender identity, focusing specifically on Muslim women in the West.

Shahzia Sikander,"The Last Post was inspired by Sikander’s ongoing interest in the colonial history of the sub-continent and the British opium trade with China. In this animation, layers of images, abstract forms, meaning, and metaphorical associations slowly unfold at the same time that more visual myths are created. The identity of the protagonist, a red-coated official, is indeterminate and suggestive of both the mercantilist policies that led to the Opium Wars with China and the cultural authority claimed by the Company school of painting over colonial India. Though situated in a particular historical context, The Last Post remains an open-ended narrative with infinite possible interpretations. The work’s scope and complexity is expanded further by its sound element, which was created by Du Yun, an artist and composer based in New York City.","Shahzia Sikander is known for her richly layered and intricately detailed graphite, ink, and gouache paintings.

Ruijun Shen,"In Seven Deadly Sins (2006), Shen utilizes abstraction to produce complex topographies of color that evoke associations with violently tumultuous landscapes. Streaks of blue and burgundy paint scatter across a peach colored silk backdrop, dripping into rough floral and botanical forms. At once both diffuse and dense, Shen’s compositions feel both expansive and contained, the colors overlaid atop another with a seemingly free spontaneity that belies more ordered and considered deliberation. Chains of short blue brushstrokes begin to suggest rivers, while sweeping bows of white and goldenrod paint resemble sheaths of wheat. The seemingly bucolic scene, however, is stained throughout with mottled red drops that resembled blood dripping across the earth. Suddenly, an amorphous white blot in the upper right corner becomes reminiscent of a decapitated head, an abstracted but terrifyingly violent reminder of the work’s title. In gesturing towards Judeo-Christian beliefs in the “seven deadly sins,” Shen reframes her work in response to a specific set of cultural histories and traditions specific to Western religions. But if her title alludes to a particular faith, her work responds to a broader set of concerns with examines how individuals exist and coexist within constantly changing environments. For Shen, painting serves as “a form of meditation,” as she describes it, “freeing the mind from everyday life” in order to blur the “between illusion and reality.” Her practice is deeply invested in reconciling the “tensions” that fragment our lives with our constant efforts to bring order through repetition and ritual. Shen’s mark making is more than just pictorial – it is a means to restore a more grounded rhythm to a chaotic world through creative expression.","Ruijun Shen conceptualizes her painting-based practice as a form of extended meditation and a means of processing tensions between time and space in the world around us. Inspired by Confucianism and Tao Chinese philosophy, her work is deeply invested in exploring the various connections that define our everyday.

Chen Shaoxiong,"After engaging primarily with video and photography for more than a decade, Chen turned to painting to explore the issue of urban change and memories—both personal and collective. This “return to origin” reveals an interesting critical reflection on the interactive relation between outside change and internal reflection, and the possibility for more experimental approaches that revive “traditional media.” For Ink Diary, Chen recorded his daily life and impressions within a rapidly-changing urban setting in ink wash paintings which he then turned into an animated film. The complex result of this simple process is both highly innovative and reflective of modernization.","Chen Shaoxiong, was a founding member—along with Lin Yilin and Liang Juhui (and later Xu Tan)—of the well-known artist collective “Big Tail Elephant” which arose in response to the rapid urbanization od Guangzhou in the early 1990s. The group created a large body of multimedia work including performance, photography, video, installation, and paintings. In his solo work, Chen focuses his efforts on the new forms of perception of urban visions and life imposed by the age of information and global travel.

Jiang Pengyi,"Unregistered City is a series of eight photographs depicting different scenes of a vacant, apparently post-apocalyptic city: Some are covered by dust and others are submerged by water. Yet, ambiguous lights blink from buildings and yachts still sail on the water, and further observation reveals these structures to be miniatures manipulated by the artist through Photoshop and other postproduction image tools. The model city’s surroundings are themselves real abandoned spaces, perhaps an empty room, a wait-to-be demolished building, or a discarded bathtub. In this way, Unregistered City is a double play on a dystopia vision of urbanization: It is an imagined city built upon the actual ruins of cities and human life. Through a dark and entropic undertone and estranged urban arrangements, the artist does not just critique, but poses fundamental questions.","Jiang Pengyi is a photographer who observes cities through the lens of his camera. His photographs have a dispassionate attitude towards the unprecedentedly fast urbanization of China. Through long-term exposure—sometimes over fifty minutes—and image manipulation, Jiang creates surreal and apocalyptic scenarios that suggest a disastrous future. For Jiang, skyscrapers are spectacles that evidence the mythologization of modern urban life. And by virtue of his technical strategies, the illuminated skyscrapers in Illuminant—a hotel, a government building, a news agency—appear bizarrely alive as if creatures from outer space.

Ho Tzu Nyen,"The Cloud of Unknowing (2011) is titled after a 14th-century medieval treatise on faith, in which “the cloud of unknowing” that stands between the aspirant and God can only be evoked by the senses, rather than the rational mind. In the video, eight protagonists act out their daily lives. The setting is a soon-to-be-demolished public housing facility in Singapore, a country in transition from a mindset of Eastern collectivism to global neoliberalism. These individuals have lived hermetically and absurdly in their apartment space until this moment, when a magical and mysterious cloud appears, connecting their seemingly disjointed lives. It is a story about the tension between solitude and togetherness, privacy and communal experiences. The symbolic cloud embodies both divine illumination and hallucination.","Drawing from historical events, documentary footage, art history, music videos, and mythical stories, Ho Tzu Nyen’s films investigate the construction of history, the narrative of myth, and the plurality of identities. Nyen often collaborates with theater professionals, and the lighting in his films is meticulously orchestrated, the compositions highly aesthetic. Ho also practices painting, performance, and writing, exploring the many possible relationships between stills, painted images, and moving images. His first feature film, HERE, premiered at the 41st Director’s Fortnight at the Cannes Film Festival in 2009. He has exhibited widely, including at the Bienal de São Paulo (2004), the Fukuoka Asian Art Triennale (2005), the Singapore Biennale (2006), the Dojima River Biennale (2009), and the Singapore Pavilion of the Venice Biennale (2011).",The Cloud of Unknowing,Unspecified,"['apartment.n.01', 'mind.n.01', 'setting.n.01', 'life.n.01', 'supporter.n.01', 'passage.n.01', 'global.s.01', 'daily.s.01', 'symbolic.a.01', 'tension.n.01', 'person.n.01', 'state.n.04', 'public.a.01', 'moment.n.01', 'sense.n.01', 'experience.n.01', 'narrative.n.01', 'space.n.01', 'video.n.01']","['light.n.06', 'collectivism.n.02', 'solitude.n.01', 'transition.n.03', 'westernization.n.01', 'east.n.02']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/ho_tzu_nyen_film_still_from_the_cloud_of_unknowing.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/ho_tzu_nyen_film_still_from_the_cloud_of_unknowing-300x169.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/the-cloud-of-unknowing/,"['Politics/8.307692307692307', 'Society/5.745324283559578', 'Material_Physical/4.0']","['Politics', 'Society', 'Material_Physical']",18.053016591251883,"['Politics/3.5', 'Power/3.269230769230769', 'Environmental/2.307692307692308']","['Politics', 'Power', 'Environmental']",9.076923076923077,"['Individual_Personal/11.07086818410348', 'Society/10.600102821155453', 'Material_Physical/10.299034445087077']","['Individual_Personal', 'Society', 'Material_Physical']",31.97000545034601,"['Mind/5.336441336441337', 'Land/3.5999999999999996', 'Urbanization/2.6183150183150183']","['Mind', 'Land', 'Urbanization']",11.554756354756355,0.6666666666666666,0.0
Young-Hae Chang Heavy Industries,"To the syncopations of a jazzy soundtrack, Korean words in white against a black background flashes between an English dialogue in black text against white ground. Comprised of curt lines such as “forever” “failure” “to live,” the Korean forms non-sequiturs and double entendres to the English script following a line of questioning between a detective and a victim telling a meandering story surrounding a bullet being in a wrist, going to hospital, traveling to Japan, and the discovery of a love triangle. This narrative of a potentially grave situation is told in a nonchalant manner. Edited with precision, the flashing animation reads at the speed of normal speech, yet, with only a few words per frame, the story insinuates and digresses as different combinations of meaning arise in the viewer’s memory of the story. The rhythm is akin to that of New Wave cinema and the flashing black and white of the screen of text strips bare a filmic apparatus that allows the viewer to consider the mechanics of story-telling.","Young-Hae Chang Heavy Industries is a Seoul-based Web art group consisting of Young-hae Chang and Marc Voge formed in 1999. Chang is a Korean artist and translator with a Ph.D in aesthetics from Universite de Paris I, and Marc Voge is an American poet living in Seoul. Their work tends to combine text with jazz to create Flash animation pieces.

Heman Chong,"With a habit of reading eight to ten books at the same time, Chong paints his two-foot tall novel covers through referencing an extensive reading list (accessible on Facebook) he has kept since 2006. Entitled “Bibliography (1): The Lonely Ones,” the list outlines representations of solitude that has been imposed on individuals or communities. Chong divides these archetypes into three over-arching notions: the Hide-away, the Castaway and the Prisoner. A novella from Stephen King’s Different Seasons collection, Rita Hayworth And Shawshank Redemption tells a story of assumed identities and prisoners’ escape to reflect on the economic infrastructures inside and outside prison as well as the thin boundaries separating the two—in this case, a Rita Hayworth poster concealing a hole in the prison wall dug for jailbreak.","Heman Chong is an artist, curator, and writer who creates texts, objects, installations, and situations in order to investigate the manner through which individuals form associations between objects in their environments. Chong’s works have been considered “archetypally conceptual” and recall frameworks of the 1960s in their potential to address collective visions of futuristic utopias. Based largely on books, Chong’s works are striking in their creation of visual order as a means to draw out the “inevitably mnemonic nature of the conceptual object.”",The Book Cover series,Unspecified,"['prison.n.01', 'poster.n.01', 'reading.n.01', 'hole.n.01', 'economic.a.01', 'community.n.01', 'book.n.01', 'person.n.01', 'impression.n.01', 'representation.n.01', 'identity.n.01', 'wall.n.01', 'narrative.n.01', 'time.n.01']","['identity.n.01', 'literature.n.02', 'person.n.01', 'object.n.01', 'environment.n.01', 'community.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/heman_chong_rita_hayworth_and_shawshank_redemption_stephen_king.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/heman_chong_rita_hayworth_and_shawshank_redemption_stephen_king-232x300.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/the-book-cover-series/,"['Individual_Personal/8.132392753445385', 'Cultural/7.486549707602339', 'Society/5.896317717370349']","['Individual_Personal', 'Cultural', 'Society']",21.51526017841807,"['Arts/5.130994152046783', 'Identity/4.797979797979798', 'History/2.4040100250626564']","['Arts', 'Identity', 'History']",12.332983975089238,"['Individual_Personal/22.937173937173945', 'Cultural/16.654082149734325', 'Society/5.892307692307693']","['Individual_Personal', 'Cultural', 'Society']",45.48356377921597,"['Mind/7.574358974358974', 'Values/5.764835164835166', 'Culture/5.5769230769230775']","['Mind', 'Values', 'Culture']",18.916117216117218,1.0,0.0
Eric Baudelaire,"In a society saturated by images, Eric Baudelaire is interested in political events that have not found their representation.  For the film The Anabasis of May and Fusako Shigenobu, Masao Adachi and 27 Years without Images, Baudelaire conducted research on 1970s Japanese cinema and more specifically on Wakamatsu and Masao Adachi’s filmography. In 1971, as the two legendary filmmakers of Japanese Nouvelle Vague were on their way home from a presentation at the Cannes festival, they stopped in Beirut, where their thinking concerning the image took the form of political activism. They made a documentary on the Palestinian struggle. Three years later, Masao Adachi became the writer for the Japanese Red Army Faction, which was linked to the PFLP (Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine).  In this film, the 30 year-long journey of the Japanese Red Army is told by two of its protagonists. As the daughter of the founder of the group, May Shigenobu was a close witness. She was born in hiding in Lebanon and only experienced being in Japan from the age of 27, after the arrest of her mother. Adachi was the theorist of fûkeiron, themovement of filmmakers who shot landscape in order to reveal the omnipresent structures of power. There are no images of his 27 years of voluntary exile since what he filmed in Lebanon was destroyed during the war on three occasions. Therefore The Anabasis of May and Fusako Shigenobu, Masao Adachi and 27 Years without Images is structured through speech, witness accounts and memory (or false memories). The stories are intertwined and reveal complex rapports between militancy, terrorism and cinema.  Thus one wonders whether, once Adachi sided with the armed struggle, he might have continued to think like a director, planning the airplane highjacking or hostage-taking as scripts where actors would be the militants and where television cameras replaced those of the filmmaker.  More broadly, this film considers the role of art and the powerlessness that could lead to the shift from an artistic practice to armed struggle. It follows the shift from a cinematographic image to that of propaganda, and armed propaganda, before concentrating on the reconstruction of missing images.","Currently based in Paris, Franco-American artist Eric Baudelaire has developed an oeuvre primarily composed of film, but which also includes photography, silkscreen prints, performance, publications and installations. In his research-based practice, the artist examines the relationship between images, past events and their documentation. Interested in the role of the cinematographic image as an index marker, Baudelaire creates narratives in which recorded facts serve as a starting point for an exploration of the unknown. In examining the changes in human behavior though interrogating the great political structures that govern the global, national and micro-communities, Baudelaire’s practice could be read through a bio-political perspective. Navigating the experience of urban living, the global, technical and economic dependencies of war, movement and the contemporary paradigm of geographical proximity and distance, Baudelaire’s practice evokes a hauntingly provocative perspective on the current political climate.","The Anabasis of May and Fusako Shigenobu, Masao Adachi, and 27 Years without Images.",Europe,"['japanese.a.01', 'struggle.n.01', 'film.n.02', 'shift.n.01', 'uncover.v.01', 'image.n.01', 'memory.n.01', 'movie.n.01', 'political.a.01', 'address.n.03', 'witness.n.01', 'documentary.n.01', 'airplane.n.01', 'mother.n.01', 'japan.n.01', 'militant.n.01', 'television.n.01', 'presentation.n.01', 'age.n.01', 'bear.v.01', 'supporter.n.01', 'actor.n.01', 'writer.n.01', 'journey.n.01', 'complex.a.01']","['reconstruction.n.03', 'undepicted.s.01', 'activism.n.01', 'memory.n.02', 'testimony.n.02', 'absence.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/lanabase_eric_baudelaire.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/lanabase_eric_baudelaire-300x223.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/the-anabasis-of-may-and-fusako-shigenobu-masao-adachi-and-27-years-without-images/,"['Cultural/2.3555555555555556', 'Material_Physical/2.0', 'Politics/1.0']","['Cultural', 'Material_Physical', 'Politics']",5.355555555555556,"['Mind/1.0', 'Activism/1.0', 'Immaterial/1.0']","['Mind', 'Activism', 'Immaterial']",3.0,"['Cultural/34.88410364145658', 'Individual_Personal/13.549206349206349', 'Politics/8.861152882205515']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Politics']",57.29446287286845,"['Media/16.790271493212668', 'Arts/6.97609710550887', 'Culture/6.2153846153846155']","['Media', 'Arts', 'Culture']",29.981753214106153,0.6666666666666666,0.0
Charles Avery,"Since 2005, Charles Avery has devoted his practice to the perpetual description of a fictional island. Replete with its own population and constantly shifting topography, Avery’s intricately conceived project amounts to an ever-expanding body of drawings, sculptures, installations and texts which evince the island. Exhibited incrementally these heterogeneous elements serve as terms within the unifying structure of the island – as multiple emissions of an imaginary state, and as a meditation on the central themes of philosophy and the problems of art-making. The ultimate destination of Avery’s epic venture is the documentation of this ‘heterotopia’ in a book of many volumes. Avery is one of a number of artists who have promoted a return to narrative. The Kadist Foundation Collection also owns a fictive map by Avery.  This drawing is a medium-sized work in which Avery depicts an event taking place on the island close to the Labour Exchange down by the port. In essence he depicts a dance-off between waiters and itinerant workers who are looking for work on the island. The idea comes from his own experience as a 16 year-old in Italy where he met a Spaniard who had danced his way from Spain to Italy, earning money in the street by doing so. Avery teamed up with him and became the hat carrier, money collector. Avery sees this kind of drawing as a companion to the large architectural views that show the principal buildings on the island and distant views of people. It is as though he is zooming in on a particular incident caught at the edge of a camera lens. The island is of course fictional but it is nevertheless a credible place, a little like Second Life, where characters act out their lives. In fact people are beginning to use the scenarios in their teaching work as though they were real and exemplary of certain true life situations.

Charlotte Moth,"It is with the eye of a sculptor that Charlotte Moth records modernist architecture and its copies which she encounters during her trips and residences. Photographed in black and white, these architectures seem empty, out of time, and open to any interpretation.  The artist creates a classification of her species of spaces, called the “Travelogue”, which is both artwork and tool since it allows her to ceaselessly generate new works. The “Travelogue” creates a toing and froing between images, experiences, interpretations and histories.  Moth’s work proposes a semiotic and phenomenological approach to space that engenders new interpretations and encourages a thinking process concerning the history of forms.  The Kadist collection owns her film The Absent Forms, shot on the rue Mallet-Stevens. Acquiring these silver gelatin photographs (…this was the plane—the variously large and accentuated, but always exactly determined plane—from which everything would be made… and Willa Niespodzianka) constitutes a coherent ensemble.  As in the film, the artist used black and white, not to provoke nostalgia but with a will to convene the creative spirit of the places she records and is inspired by.  There are here certain recurring motifs present in her oeuvre; such as the flat object which offers a surface for projections and interpretations, like a screen. The formal associations suggest new interpretations, the opposition between empty and full forms connect her photographic practice to that of the sculptor.  But these photographs are also like rumors that the artist is propagating. While she was invited on residency in Poland, the artist discovered an abandoned modernist villa and photographed it, then when she returned to continue her investigation, she discovered that it has been destroyed. Several temporalities are at work in this image, since the artist revisits landscape photography which is at once mental and fictional, present and absent.  As for the image of the famous empty plinth in the Parc des Buttes Chaumont, it is also part of a certain mythology of the city, “from which everything would be made”.","Charlotte Moth has been constituting an image bank since 1999. She photographs and develops black and white photographs taken in places she passes through around the world. With the eye of a sculptor, she records Modernist architecture in Brazil, Bauhaus style in Germany, empty spaces, out of time. Thus she creates a classification of different types of spaces (different species). This Travelogue, as she calls it, is an organic process, a collage, an activity revealing connections between image and experience.

LaToya Ruby Frazier,"LaToya Ruby Frazier is an artist and a militant; her photos combine intimate views of her relation with her parents and grandparents with the history of the Afro-American community of Braddock, Pennsylvania, where she grew up and where her family still live.  She reports upon the decline of this steel-producing town, which was once prosperous and where the local population today is devastated by poverty, unemployment and health problems linked to pollution.  The town has currently closed the hospital which increases unemployment and makes access to treatment complicated for the residents of one of the most polluted towns in the USA.  Through this documentary work with ties to the intimate, she goes beyond the basic information to touch upon the human consequences of these tragedies.  Frazier’s images are embedded in the history of the United States of America and they highlight what is unspoken in the social landscape. Her work is focused on the tragedy of Braddock, a town hit by a slow decay and increasing poverty (steel factories closing, crack epidemic, community debacle, disappearance of shops and urban equipment).  The captioned photographs of protests and advertising are printed with a textured effect, burnt-looking, recalling the “Rusty Belt” nickname for the steel factories of this region.  The portfolio reports on a new wave of devastation, that of a workers’ culture in the process of disappearing.  In 2009, the Levi’s brand chose the town as the backdrop of its new advertising campaign, focusing on the figure of the “new pioneer”.  Frazier mixes photographs of this campaign with others of the town and its protests against the closure and destruction of the hospital in a form of critique of the utilization of this town and its population by Levi’s.  The juxtaposition of these images documents and denounces the violent and jarring economic ambiguity of the commercial dynamic that feeds off a tragedy and a decrepit context. The proceeds of the sale of these artworks will go to the activist groups fighting for the reconstruction of the hospital.","LaToya Ruby Frazier was born in 1982 in Braddock, Pennsylvania (USA).

Goshka Macuga,"In this anti-collage, which comes from a series of 4, Macuga takes a photo she found in the archives of Zacheta National Gallery in Warsaw. The series was made on the occasion of her exhibition there in 2011. In 2000, Harald Szeemann curated an exhibition at Zacheta called ‘Beware of Exiting your Dreams: You May Find Yourself in Somebody Else’s.’ The exhibition provoked a violent response as a result of his inclusion of Maurizio Cattelan’s La nona ora, where the figure of the Pope is struck down by a meteor. The work was vandalized by an MP; Anda Rottenberg, the director of the museum received a stream of abusive letters, many of them anti-semitic. Rottenberg organized a series of shows that were regarded by right wing Poles as scandalous and eventually she was forced to leave her post in 2001. In Anti-Collage, Rottenberg, depicted at a ceremony celebrating the centenary of Zacheta at the Presidential Palace, has been silhouetted out of the image. The void represents not only a dark period of Polish cultural history but also reflects upon the way in which history is rewritten in fascistic societies, particularly in former Soviet-style countries where inconvenient memories are erased. Ironically of course she stands between two Polish flags. After destroying Cattelan’s work, the MP, Witold Tomczak, wrote to the Prime Minister not only demanding Rottenberg’s dismissal but also suggesting she should curate in Israel rather than in Poland. Macuga’s image is a timely reminder of cultural vandalism and censorship as well anti-semitism in Poland, alongside the work of Yael Bartana.","She works with archival materials she finds in libraries and museums. Her work often begins with the history of the sites in which she is working, researching the collections of the institutions she works with, the work of artists she is interested in. Sometimes she recreates works by other artists, blurring the boundaries between artist and curator. For example at the Kunsthalle Basel, she recreated a 1971 exhibition of sculptures by Robert Morris that took place at the Tate Gallery in London which was closed by Tate authorities after 4 days as a result of safety scares. Macuga’s recreation allowed the public to experience the danger as well as the avant-garde nature of that exhibition. Her Basel show also engaged with issues relating to Neocolonialism, the arms race and US militancy, bringing together photographs taken by Aby Warburg during his exploration of the Hopi tribe in Arizona in the mid 19th century, a video of her own journey on the footsteps of Warburg and snapshots taken by a Vietnam war veteran that Makuga acquired on the Internet. She juxtaposed these with images of contemporary events relating to Afghanistan and Iraq and the economic crisis. More recently she brought a tapestry of Guernica that normally hangs at the United Nations in New York, to the Whitechapel Gallery in London and used it as a backdrop for public meetings. At documenta in Kassel, she exhibited a tapestry that brought together photographic images of the artists in documenta and a view of people in Kabul. Macuga’s work is engaged with political issues of her times.     Goshka Macuga was born in 1967 in Warsaw (Poland).

Margo Wolowiec,"Imagine How Many is a woven polyester depiction of blurred text and floral images, distorted beyond complete recognition. It resembles a newspaper with a conspicuous “fold” down the middle, but its contents are undoubtedly drawn from Wolowiec’s practice of image aggregation and do not follow the clear formatting newspapers normally possess. Instead, Wolowiec has created an alternative publication of sorts, drawing in a third, comparative source of “networked” imagery and information,  inserting the concept of publication into her greater examination of the structures governing dissemination.","Margo Wolowiec uses her multidisciplinary practice to examine space,  material versus conceptual practices, and affective responses. Working predominantly with textiles, the artist aggregates “non-images” and controversial texts from the internet, she then creates complex, visually  fragmented fabric compositions, which cut in and out like static. She analogizes the networked layering of woven fibers with the technological networks from which she draws her images, articulating a novel, analog means of imagining and relating to the greater technological ontology upon which contemporary society depends. Her forms are largely sourced from visualizations of glitches and aberrations found on Internet-based social networking platforms such as Instagram, Facebook, and Tumblr. In translating pixelated images into fiber art through painstaking technique of hand dye and weaving, Wolowiec offers a wholly original response to producing art in the digital age by narrowing the gap between traditional practices of handcraft and contemporary modes of image making offered through new media technologies.",Imagine How Many,Americas,"['newspaper.n.01', 'imagination.n.02', 'pull.v.01', 'kind.n.01', 'format.n.01', 'concept.n.01', 'center.n.01', 'beginning.n.04', 'structure.n.01', 'image.n.01', 'practice.n.01', 'make.v.03']","['weave.v.02', 'text.n.01', 'language.n.01', 'distortion.n.05', 'newspaper.n.01', 'issue.n.11', 'dissemination.n.01', 'network.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Screen-Shot-2020-05-07-at-12.46.06-PM.png,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Screen-Shot-2020-05-07-at-12.46.06-PM-300x215.png,https://kadist.org/work/imagine-how-many/,"['Cultural/13.080177442096948', 'Society/4.171428571428571', 'Politics/0.8235294117647058']","['Cultural', 'Society', 'Politics']",18.075135425290224,"['Language/4.746031746031746', 'Media/4.470897832817338', 'Economy/4.171428571428571']","['Language', 'Media', 'Economy']",13.388358150277654,"['Cultural/32.75550140434042', 'Society/18.369342095812687', 'Individual_Personal/17.682654600301664']","['Cultural', 'Society', 'Individual_Personal']",68.80749810045477,"['Media/9.358809920729426', 'Mind/7.582934712346478', 'Culture/7.280860805860806']","['Media', 'Mind', 'Culture']",24.22260543893671,0.6666666666666666,0.3333333333333333
Cerith Wyn Evans,"Untitled (Perfect Lovers + 1) takes as its starting point Felix Gonzales-Torres’s seminal work Untitled (Perfect Lovers), in which two clocks were synchronized and left to run without interference, the implication being that one would stop before the other. Gonzales-Torres’ original work was a personal allusion to his own partner’s increasingly debilitating HIV-related illness, which grapples with the existential tension of coexistence in the face of death. Cerith Wyn Evans’s piece takes the same concept, and adds a third clock, moving from the intimacy of a monogamous relationship to suggest a more expansive, or possibly polyamorous alternative. Untitled (Perfect Lovers + 1) transforms the tension in Gonzales-Torres’s work into something more ambiguous and unsteady. The three clocks turn outward to force the viewer’s implication into both Evans’s work, as well as its reference to Gonzales-Torres.","Welsh conceptual artist, sculptor, and filmmaker Cerith Wyn Evans’s work often deals with perception and systems of signification, seeking to rupture extant forms in favor of new, more imaginatively productive models. This can occur through textual interventions, the dismantling of space or temporality, and  poly-vocal assemblages that seek multiplicity, opening outwards rather than closing into a singular understanding. His work revels in the unfixed nature of meanings and ideas, finding fluid potentialities and powerful metaphors for its audience to ponder.",Untitled (Perfect Lovers + 1),Europe,"['tension.n.01', 'leave.v.01', 'concept.n.01', 'death.n.01', 'original.s.01', 'personal.a.01', 'mention.n.01', 'relationship.n.01', 'piece.n.01']","['clock.n.01', 'synchronize.v.01', 'mortality.n.01', 'death.n.01', 'aids.n.01', 'closeness.n.01', 'relationship.n.02']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Screen-Shot-2020-05-07-at-1.13.58-PM.png,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Screen-Shot-2020-05-07-at-1.13.58-PM-300x226.png,https://kadist.org/work/untitled-perfect-lovers-1/,"['Individual_Personal/3.6263736263736264', 'Society/2.6', 'Material_Physical/2.5494505494505493']","['Individual_Personal', 'Society', 'Material_Physical']",8.775824175824177,"['Emotion/2.6263736263736264', 'Time/1.7802197802197801', 'War/1.6']","['Emotion', 'Time', 'War']",6.006593406593407,"['Individual_Personal/6.293772893772894', 'Cultural/5.469683257918552', 'Material_Physical/1.6923076923076925']","['Individual_Personal', 'Cultural', 'Material_Physical']",13.45576384399914,"['Values/3.447619047619048', 'Culture/2.307692307692308', 'Mind/1.8461538461538463']","['Values', 'Culture', 'Mind']",7.601465201465203,0.6666666666666666,0.0
Kudzanai-Violet Hwami,"This painting is the direct result of the artist’s research into her roots. Kudzanai-Violet Hwami sought to find a way to immerse herself in present-day Zimbabwe, spending a month at an artist-run space Dzimbanhete on the outskirts of Harare and living with a traditional healer. According to the artist, the experience left her feeling othered by the inability to fully integrate herself into the place she called home.  The man depicted in the painting Dreamcatcher is of a generation that remembers Rhodesia, an unrecognized state that existed for 14 years between 1965 and 1979 before becoming The Republic of Zimbabwe in 1980. The work is of the artist’s great uncle, his representation symbolizes an entire generation of Zimbabwean men who fought in the Bush War against the white minority regime of Ian Smith in Rhodesia during the 1960s and 1970s. At the time there was much hope that Robert Mugabe would lead Zimbabwe to a better future. The title is a reference to the fact that this generation who fought for independence, felt they did not gain much for their sacrifices. The ruling Zanu PF party under Mugabe did not meet their dreams held for independence with Zimbabwe’s economy in tatters and years of hardship and financial deprivation.","UK-based artist, Kudzanai-Violet Hwami was born in Gutu, Zimbabwe in 1993 and lived in South Africa from the ages of 9 to 17. Having lived in 3 different countries, she is concerned by the notion of home and converging cultures, questioning what it really means to be African. She explores issues around diaspora, displacement and identity based on her individual experience, understanding diaspora as a possibility of reinventing oneself and using art to reconcile the values of her home country with those she has been confronted with throughout her life. She creates vivid, large-scale paintings; mainly portraits of family and black body nudes mixed with symbolic elements. She draws most of her inspiration from old personal photographs that she reproduces with oil and acrylic mixed with collages of digital images found on internet. Black bodies are at the core of her work, through which, she explores questions of sexuality, gender and politics.",The Dreamcatcher,Middle East & Africa,"['coevals.n.01', 'party.n.01', 'keep.v.01', 'direct.a.01', 'picture.v.02', 'dream.n.01', 'economy.n.01', 'future.n.01', 'traditional.a.01', 'government.n.01', 'war.n.01', 'consequence.n.01', 'representation.n.01', 'mention.n.01', 'white.a.01', 'experience.n.01', 'title.n.01', 'space.n.01', 'time.n.01']","['identity.n.02', 'otherness.n.01', 'association.n.04', 'civil_war.n.01', 'conflict.n.01', 'trauma.n.02']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/19.PA_.MA_.11.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/19.PA_.MA_.11-225x300.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/dreamcatcher/,"['Society/7.892106586224233', 'Politics/7.007692307692308', 'Individual_Personal/4.291849816849817']","['Society', 'Politics', 'Individual_Personal']",19.19164871076636,"['Power/4.241025641025641', 'War/3.5882352941176467', 'Violence/3.534640522875817']","['Power', 'War', 'Violence']",11.363901458019104,"['Individual_Personal/15.31282051282052', 'Cultural/12.375996552467143', 'Material_Physical/11.07148407148407']","['Individual_Personal', 'Cultural', 'Material_Physical']",38.76030113677174,"['Mind/7.466666666666667', 'Culture/6.564102564102564', 'Time/6.090287490287491']","['Mind', 'Culture', 'Time']",20.12105672105672,0.3333333333333333,0.0
Julien Creuzet,"Full title of the work: Grain par Grain, sur le parterre humide et fissuré. Érosion sévère, graine, ma cote. Où est la manne, semence de l’antiquité. Grain ou pion, rachitique, échiquier économique. La Chine ne nous bouffera pas la jambe, l’échine. Si tu disparaissais de mon ventre, gonflé de misère. Héros invisible, écu cancéreuse, foutue humanité. Immiscé dans ma vie la plus lointaine, parcelle, parasite tenace. Eau de pluie, nous t’évoquons encore une fois. Mon jour depuis toujours. (Sans toi, je sens que tu t’en vas)  This work is reminiscent of an island, a raft thrown into the sea. It gives the feeling of certain fragility but the grains of rice refer to the cycle of nature and life. The different elements each carry significant, the box referring to the body, rice to agriculture and trade, the European flag to international geopolitics, the Kalashnikov to the violence of war and drug trafficking. It is a visual collage of references to a world that we share¾-signs from universal popular culture. The large carpet on the floor is reminiscent of the makeshift stands employed in the flea markets in the outskirts of cities and refers to the precariousness of sellers from different horizons. The terms “archipelic” and “creolization” return as mantras in his vocabulary and in articles written on the artist and it is that this vocabulary is a way of doing and being in the world, fragmentary and crossed by a multiplicity of identities.","The work of Julien Creuzet reveals painful stories – both personal and political – making it impossible separate one from the other. Creuzet’s work places at the heart of its facilities the link between identities and economies, be it the transatlantic trajectories of the West Indians or those of the migrants of the South. He composes landscapes made of heterogeneous elements, mixing hurricanes of the Caribbean and the covered markets of the Parisian suburbs. Following Edouard Glissant, he operates a collective and subjective re-appropriation of an Antillean historical narrative, in the absence of cultural categories.",Grain par Grain…,Europe,"['market.n.01', 'sea.n.01', 'invisible.a.01', 'flag.n.01', 'box.n.01', 'island.n.01', 'floor.n.01', 'write.v.01', 'popular.a.01', 'collage.n.01', 'violence.n.01', 'war.n.01', 'elements.n.01', 'mention.n.01', 'identity.n.01', 'nature.n.01', 'city.n.01', 'ocular.a.02', 'culture.n.01', 'title.n.01', 'body.n.01', 'life.n.01']","['nature.n.01', 'life.n.01', 'agribusiness.n.01', 'trade.n.01', 'geopolitics.n.01', 'war.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Grain-par-grain_preview_KADIST.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Grain-par-grain_preview_KADIST-300x225.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/grain-par-grain/,"['Society/17.408692365426113', 'Material_Physical/6.342315655359134', 'Individual_Personal/4.066666666666666']","['Society', 'Material_Physical', 'Individual_Personal']",27.817674687451913,"['Economy/10.400722394220844', 'Materiality/3.235897435897436', 'War/2.75']","['Economy', 'Materiality', 'War']",16.38661983011828,"['Society/18.502545983428337', 'Material_Physical/17.602492278962874', 'Individual_Personal/14.821037442090077']","['Society', 'Material_Physical', 'Individual_Personal']",50.92607570448129,"['Identity/6.440085061137692', 'Space/6.346153846153846', 'Urbanization/4.546606334841629']","['Identity', 'Space', 'Urbanization']",17.332845242133168,1.0,0.0
Nohemí Pérez,"A rich and isolated region, El Catacumbo is located near the border with Venezuela. Different groups fighting over its gold, its oil, and more recently, narcotic plantations have exploited it over the years, provoking massacres, displacement, and migrations amongst its native populations. For an extended period of time, Nohemí Pérez has collected different sorts of visual documents such as press images and school books that are at the core of her imagery, and that operate as an active register of the convoluted history of her native region. Pérez’s skillful and eloquent watercolors, Apuntes para panorama Catacumbo, testify to these aspects of Colombia’s history that have been veiled by other equally pressing political issues. They also act as sketches for Panorama Catacumbo, a series of large-scale carbon drawings on canvas that reference 19th-century panoramas. By creating a kind of environment, the series evidences the colonial take behind a spectacular and exotic vision of the so-called New World at the heart of which she camouflages contemporary scenes of war and violence, as the ones represented in her Apuntes.","Nohemí Pérez speaks about her pictorial practice as being born out of the necessity of preserving a landscape that has been affected by war. Coming from a region that was deeply touched by the Colombian armed conflict (El Catacumbo) her works deal with the inscription of violence in bodies and nature. Be it that she catalogues endangered tree species, or that she portrays the ravaged Colombian territory to preserve it in a mnemonic act, the complex relationship between human ambition and nature’s depletion seeps to the surface of Pérez’s drawings and paintings with a rare strength and sensitivity.",Apuntes para panorama Catacumbo,Americas,"['region.n.01', 'native.a.01', 'oil.n.01', 'population.n.01', 'imagination.n.02', 'kind.n.01', 'history.n.01', 'represent.v.01', 'school.n.01', 'locate.v.01', 'boundary_line.n.01', 'aspect.n.01', 'vision.n.01', 'time_period.n.01', 'issue.n.01', 'document.n.01', 'book.n.01', 'violence.n.01', 'series.n.01', 'environment.n.01', 'war.n.01', 'mention.n.01', 'contemporary.s.01', 'drawing.n.01', 'ocular.a.02']","['colombia.n.01', 'violence.n.01', 'colonialism.n.01', 'war.n.01', 'exploitation.n.01', 'watercolor.n.01', 'sketch.n.01', 'migration.n.01', 'supplanting.n.01', 'landscape.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/IMG_NP_Panorama-Catatumbo-3-e1588702911972.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/IMG_NP_Panorama-Catatumbo-3-e1588702911972-300x224.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/apuntes-para-panorama-catacumbo-2/,"['Society/13.727049240748933', 'Politics/6.8504496535456285', 'Cultural/6.69735122119023']","['Society', 'Politics', 'Cultural']",27.27485011548479,"['Violence/5.281811145510836', 'Land/3.5198830409356723', 'War/3.511904761904762']","['Violence', 'Land', 'War']",12.31359894835127,"['Individual_Personal/23.55584807349514', 'Cultural/18.994923764260154', 'Material_Physical/13.412187812187812']","['Individual_Personal', 'Cultural', 'Material_Physical']",55.9629596499431,"['Mind/9.004424333836099', 'Time/5.896503496503496', 'Values/4.7089994972347915']","['Mind', 'Time', 'Values']",19.609927327574386,0.3333333333333333,0.0
Erika Tan,"APA JIKA, The Mis-Placed Comma is one of three works Erika Tan filmed within exhibition spaces during the final stages of their transition from colonial period law courts to the National Gallery Singapore. Part of an on-going body of work, this video focuses on the figure of a forgotten weaver, Halimah Binti Abdullah, who participated in the 1924 British Empire Exhibition in the United Kingdom. A minor figure in the exhibition histories of what was formerly known as Malaya (today, Singapore and Malaysia), Halimah exists as a series of footnotes, gaining historical attention only for the act of a premature death from pneumonia, in London and away from home. Her remains are located in an unmarked grave in Woking. Amongst the collections held at the Victoria & Albert Museum an incomplete textile on an incomplete loom may be the only record of Halimah’s last creative act. As a weaver, her participation, or mode of operation in the Empire Exhibition, was arguably two-fold. She was both textile weaver, and also producer of the image of the “Malay woman”.  Tan’s work calls into question the place of the artist and that of grand exhibitions, invoking the form of ‘debate’ as a framework for the discussions around Halimah’s relevance in a national institution, currently engaged in postcolonial reframing of modernism. The work is situated in a former colonial law court, in a country where open debate and freedom of speech is highly monitored. Today, it houses a permanent display of Singaporean art under the heading Siapa Nama Kamu? (“What is your name?” in Malay), overtly placing a struggle for identity at the heart of its narrative. Taking the form of a filmic journey, APA JIKA (What if?) can be seen as an attempt to insert Halimah into the developing discourses of modernity and Singaporean art canonization for which the National Gallery Singapore is becoming symbolic. Today, there is no work present by Malay women artists in the National Gallery Singapore, however, the Malay female body as an image fills the gallery walls. As such, the film explores Halimah’s status as both subject and object and possible forms of repatriation that might occur by weaving together both past and present to challenge received narratives and produce space for discussion.","Erika Tan’s practice is primarily research-driven with a focus on the moving image, referencing distributed media in the form of cinema, gallery-based works, Internet and digital practices. Her current projects explore the discursive connections between the technology of cinematic green screen space to that of the museum and its technologies of dislocation (with particular focus on the colonial Museum in ‘Malaya’ and the repatriation of objects).","APA JIKA, The Mis-Placed Comma",Asia,"['fabric.n.01', 'woman.n.01', 'form.n.01', 'figure.n.01', 'body.n.01', 'address.n.03', 'discourse.n.01', 'status.n.01', 'british.a.01', 'record.n.01', 'ongoing.s.01', 'struggle.n.01', 'institution.n.01', 'national.a.01', 'creative.a.01', 'concluding.s.01', 'locate.v.01', 'display.n.01', 'phase.n.01', 'passage.n.01', 'space.n.01', 'journey.n.01', 'symbolic.a.01', 'model.n.01', 'attention.n.01']","['weave.v.02', 'woman.n.01', 'feminist_movement.n.01', 'sex.n.04', 'film.n.02', 'museum.n.01', 'institution.n.01', 'canon.n.01', 'repatriation.n.01', 'revision.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-05-08-at-12.12.26-PM.png,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-05-08-at-12.12.26-PM-300x84.png,https://kadist.org/work/apa-jika-the-mis-placed-comma/,"['Cultural/9.320751633986928', 'Individual_Personal/3.0', 'Society/1.675']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Society']",13.995751633986929,"['Media/5.645751633986928', 'Identity/2.0', 'Arts/1.8']","['Media', 'Identity', 'Arts']",9.445751633986928,"['Individual_Personal/18.043517919988513', 'Material_Physical/17.128424662712593', 'Society/15.19948589422274']","['Individual_Personal', 'Material_Physical', 'Society']",50.371428476923846,"['Space/7.235042735042734', 'Time/5.079481792717086', 'Economy/4.896941070625281']","['Space', 'Time', 'Economy']",17.2114655983851,0.6666666666666666,0.0
Gala Porras-Kim,"4 mourners on a mantel is part of Gala Porras-Kim’s larger installation and body of research—entitled An Index and Its settings—in which the artist reconsiders 235 ancient burial figures (from circa 200 BCE – 50 CE) from what is now Mexico’s Pacific coast that are part of the Proctor Stafford Collection held by the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA). Eschewing their current musicological function, 4 mourners on a mantel presents photo-realistic depictions of said figures on top of a hypothetical collector’s fireplace. Herein, these funerary objects are displaced as curios which stare back at the viewer in signs of grief and confusion. Could they be lamenting their lost hosts, or are they upset with being dug up, bought and sold, and ultimately transformed from sacred objects into appropriated trinkets for domestic entraining?   Whatever the case may be, Porras-Kim touches on the strange life of objects (and their authors) as their use and meaning is tempered not by their inherent form, but by ownership and various display apparati.  Eschewing a pure materialist reading, An Index and Its settings challenges how strict formalist interpretation of artworks can obfuscate the ethical and political means of exchange through which an object is handled. These works can likewise be viewed as ciphers in which mute objects are made to perform acts of ventriloquism to satisfy the desires of those who possess them.","Gala Porras-Kim’s work plays objects against their framing to consider how an artefact’s “message” is tempered by display, use, historic setting, and other modes of exchange.  In particular, she often works with pre-Colombian objects, dead languages, and like archaeological fragments whose intention and original context have been obscured by time, or by inscription into another culture. In doing so, Porras-Kim presses the subjective nature of archaeology as well as the general epistemology of all forms of historiographic science. If cultural history is a mode to consider where we come from, Porras-Kim’s work teases that these background narratives are not only incomplete but may be contaminated by contemporary assumptions, wants, and biases around material culture and its presentation.",4 mourners on a mantel,Americas,"['object.n.01', 'figure.n.01', 'reading.n.01', 'los_angeles.n.01', 'transform.v.01', 'keep.v.01', 'perform.v.01', 'strange.a.01', 'setting.n.01', 'mexico.n.01', 'ancient.s.01', 'current.a.01', 'display.n.01', 'lose.v.01', 'exchange.n.01', 'writer.n.01', 'function.n.01', 'sign.n.01', 'desire.n.01', 'see.v.05', 'interpretation.n.01', 'museum.n.01', 'artwork.n.01', 'meaning.n.01', 'political.a.01']","['curio.n.01', 'anthropology.n.01', 'cipher.n.01', 'archeology.n.01', 'funeral.n.01', 'ritual.n.01', 'grief.n.01', 'domestic.a.02', 'sacred.a.01', 'ontology.n.02', 'appropriation.n.03']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/IMAGE-1_GPK_4-mourners-on-a-mantel_Gala-Porras-Kim_-2017.jpeg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/IMAGE-1_GPK_4-mourners-on-a-mantel_Gala-Porras-Kim_-2017-300x174.jpeg,https://kadist.org/work/4-mourners-on-a-mantel/,"['Cultural/11.806152636493193', 'Society/7.329598506069094', 'Material_Physical/7.044444444444444']","['Cultural', 'Society', 'Material_Physical']",26.180195587006732,"['History/5.728291316526611', 'Physics/3.8857142857142857', 'Culture/3.775910364145658']","['History', 'Physics', 'Culture']",13.389915966386553,"['Individual_Personal/18.00359640359641', 'Society/8.49708726945569', 'Material_Physical/8.489724310776941']","['Individual_Personal', 'Society', 'Material_Physical']",34.990407983829044,"['Emotion/13.181618381618385', 'Land/5.775438596491227', 'Urbanization/3.4502923976608186']","['Emotion', 'Land', 'Urbanization']",22.40734937577043,0.6666666666666666,0.0
Manuel Correa,"La Forma del Presente (The Shape of Now) presents the difficulties of writing history in order to achieve peace and reconciliation. It portrays the lived experiences of different social spheres invested peacekeeping: while scientists, academics and activists attempt to find possible routes to normalize a war-torn society, a group of elderly mothers find a direct way to approach the possible killers of their disappeared children, forging a necessary and genuine encounter in the attempt to find clues about their whereabouts. La Forma del Presente (The Shape of Now) is an account of their search for closure and an ambitious reflection on remembering the past after war’s end.  Manuel Correa made the film during, and in response to, the signing of the peace deal between the Colombian government and the FARC-EP guerrilla faction. Although the number of atrocities is too impossible to account or present, it is estimated over two-hundred thousand people have perished in the war and over twenty-five thousand people disappeared by force. After the peace deal was in limbo, after it was rejected by popular vote, the government chose to implement the agreements regardless, further polarizing the public opinion. For many, amnesty and impunity seemed high prices to pay for potential peace. While several survivors in the film forgive the murders of their closest family members, the film asks how can a deeply divided society actually forgive and forget?","Manuel Correa is interested in the spaces available in the art world, cinema and other forums to share ideas and creative and critical explorations.

Rometti Costales,"Canción para un fósil canoro (Song for a chanting fossil) departs from the history of the building that currently hosts the Museo de la Solidaridad Salvador Allende (MSSA), Santiago, Chile. The artists associated the layers of its history with the vestiges of life and the processes of fossilization that have taken place in areas of the Atacama Desert, a territory that has been the stage for several episodes in Chile’s economic and political past.  The work operates as a metaphor for the strata of historical memory, condensing different materials and operations. The intrinsic appearance and characteristics of the elements with which the artists work connect to other ideas and stories that echo around them. Skeletal remains, minerals, and petrification evoke the successive changes undergone by the building from a family residence at the turn of the 20th century, to the Department of Humanistic Studies, a telephone surveillance center during the dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet, to a cultural institution today, whose archives document a crucial part of the political history of art in Latin America.  In Rometti Costales’ work, the use of lost-wax casting (also known as precision casting), stands as a reference to the process of fossilization, through which one material replaces another. The works in the exhibition refer to the displacement and decontextualization of objects, bodies, and materials. They represent the fragility of the human and the non-human, the consequences of colonization, and the inscription of endemic nature as cultural patrimony within nationalist discourses.  The sculptures conceived by Rometti Costales reflect the instrumentalization and decoding of history, and how interpretations and values modify over time. A gesture is recast, inspired by the hands of the anonymous Chuquicamata mummy (also known as “The Copper Man”). The branches of an araucaria tree and the remains of a desert bird evoke the domestic furniture of the past residence of MSSA. These interventions invite a discussion on the conservation and transmission of the narratives behind social and cultural history, and how spatial and temporal dimensions unfold in different geographical locations.","Rometti Costales is Julia Rometti (1975 Nice, France) and Victor Costales (1974 Minsk, Belarus), who started their artistic collaboration in 2007.  In the past years, their research has led them to South America, and particularly Brazil and Ecuador where Costales has also lived. During these trips, they developed a form of attention to the environment, traditions and micro histories of theses places. Their work is a composition based on their personal reading of a situation and the understanding of philosophical and anthropological debates on the relation between nature and culture.",Canción para un fósil canoro (Song for a chanting fossil),Americas,"['history.n.01', 'cultural.a.01', 'material.n.01', 'building.n.01', 'artist.n.01', 'procedure.n.01', 'political.a.01', 'surveillance.n.01', 'narrative.n.01', 'song.n.01', 'episode.n.01', 'telephone.n.01', 'discourse.n.01', 'anonymous.a.01', 'institution.n.01', 'district.n.01', 'hands.n.01', 'phase.n.01', 'dimension.n.01', 'appearance.n.01', 'tree.n.01', 'feature.n.01', 'united_states.n.01', 'intervention.n.01', 'location.n.01']","['chile.n.01', 'dictatorship.n.01', 'body.n.03', 'bird.n.01', 'trace.n.02', 'fossilization.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Rometti-Costales1.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Rometti-Costales1-300x200.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/cancion-para-un-fosil-canoro-song-for-a-chanting-fossil/,"['Material_Physical/11.328027837315766', 'Politics/1.7692307692307692', 'Society/1.547008547008547']","['Material_Physical', 'Politics', 'Society']",14.644267153555083,"['Space/6.346153846153846', 'Land/2.6198830409356724', 'Politics/1.7692307692307692']","['Space', 'Land', 'Politics']",10.73526765632029,"['Material_Physical/27.47094048022841', 'Society/26.34004884004885', 'Individual_Personal/19.492393880629184']","['Material_Physical', 'Society', 'Individual_Personal']",73.30338320090644,"['Land/12.539296960349594', 'Urbanization/9.329426129426128', 'Spirituality/6.641758241758241']","['Land', 'Urbanization', 'Spirituality']",28.51048133153396,0.6666666666666666,0.3333333333333333

Both of those interests feed deeply into his artistic practice, which ranges from workshops, dialogues, and exchanges to environments, drawings, and sculpture.

The bulb itself has been removed and replaced with three overlapping circles of paper.

Gabriel Kuri,"Self Portrait as Symmetric Retention and Flow Chart is part of the series Bottled Water Branded Water exhibited at the Parc Saint Léger, Centre d’art contemporain. The work utilises everyday objects and through its arrangement assigns alternative meaning to the objects. Referring to the formal language of modernist sculpture, the artist does not disregard the function of the polyethylene foam or the plastic bottle that forms the self-portrait; rather, the physical and functional attributes of the material fusions further meaning to the objects. This series takes its starting point in the commercial activity of the Parc Saint Léger until the 1970s as a thermal spa, looking at the commodification of water and the commercialization of natural resources. To make Self-Portrait as Symmetric Retention and Flow Chart (2012), Kuri sculpted a form mimicking human thighs out of gold-foiled isolation foam. Dangling between the thighs are two transparent plastic bags, one filled with clear liquid and the other filled with yellow liquid. Here, he juxtaposes the two heterogeneous materials into his self-portrait, bringing together balance and harmony to plasticity. In a humorous way, Kuri draws attention to the hidden wit that these innocuous materials possess, and the way in which they weave themselves silently into the rhythm of our lives.","Gabriel Kuri works from repurposed natural, industrial, and mass-produced objects and materials including soda cans, shopping bags, receipts, insulation foam, shells, and magazines. Focusing his attention – through almost Dadaist means – on consumer culture, Kuri playfully charts transactions and creates systems that speak about both everyday life and the global economy. His practice is often site-specific and refers to the site of exhibition.

Pablo Rasgado,"Pablo Rasgado’s paintings and installations serve as a visual record of contemporary urban human behavior. Rasgado wanders through the urban landscape in Mexico City and other major cities, looking for moments of intrigue in the dirt and debris. He captures these details by extracting materials from the sites and deploying them in the gallery. Raw materials thus become abstract paintings, which are both actively engaged with the site of their origin and politically and socially charged. Avenida Corona del Rosal (2011) is a section of wall extracted from the Mexico City street named in the title. It has been “painted” with an accumulation of byproducts of automobiles—diesel soot, dirt, tire and brake particles—to create an ironically poetic and beautiful portrait of the pollution that ravishes the city.","Pablo Rasgado reconfigures everyday life into new abstractions.

Adrian Wong,"Untitled (Grate I/II: Shan Mei Playground/ Grand Fortune Mansion) is part of a series drawn from architectural objects that mark the boundary of public and private spaces Wong encountered while strolling in Hong Kong. Intrigued by the accidental preservation of historical building material by renovations and rebuilding, Wong began paying attention to the experience conveyed by layered forms accreted to affect the visual historicity of a space. The geometric forms in the piece are welded together as a composite replica of a metal grate from a children’s playground next to Wong’s studio, a security grate door from his apartment complex, and the latticework that holds an air conditioner from an electronic store, and a front grate from an elementary school on his bus route. This melding is a recognition of objects that normally recedes into the background of one’s experience in the city by recognizing their role as partitions that break visual fields into parallax spaces or planes of movement.","Born and raised in Chicago, Adrian Wong was originally trained in research psychology at Stanford University. He began making and exhibiting work in San Francisco while concurrently conducting experiments on young children for his Masters degree. Wong’s training in psychology made him aware of the limitation of research methodology, which ultimately redirected his interest to other aspects of his research subjects: “I’m not looking for universal facts; I’m looking for more subjective and affective entry points.” He has been based in Hong Kong, S.A.R. since 2005, where he is the co-founder and director of Embassy Projects, an arts consultancy and independent production studio. His installations, videos, and sculptures draw from varied subjects and explore the intricacies of his relationship to his environment. These relationships, often relying on collaboration with subjects, take on modes of the experiential, historical, and cultural, at times, filtered by fantastical or fictionalized narratives.",Untitled (Grate I/II: Shan Mei Playground/ Grand Fortune Mansion),Asia,"['ocular.a.02', 'space.n.01', 'experience.n.01', 'apartment.n.01', 'shop.n.01', 'object.n.01', 'airplane.n.01', 'geometric.s.01', 'architectural.a.01', 'private.a.01', 'school.n.01', 'form.n.01', 'studio.n.01', 'attention.n.01', 'background.n.01', 'child.n.01', 'function.n.03', 'public.a.01', 'historical.a.01', 'motion.n.03', 'city.n.01', 'material.n.01', 'piece.n.01', 'series.n.01']","['amalgam.n.02', 'division.n.12', 'foreground.v.01', 'history.n.01', 'average.s.02', 'layer.v.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/untitled-grate-iii-shan-mei-playground-grand-fortune-mansion.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/untitled-grate-iii-shan-mei-playground-grand-fortune-mansion-300x198.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/untitled-grate-iii-shan-mei-playground-grand-fortune-mansion/,"['Material_Physical/2.5326203208556146', 'Society/1.0', 'Cultural/0.8421052631578947']","['Material_Physical', 'Society', 'Cultural']",4.374725584013509,"['Time/2.5326203208556146', 'History/1.0', 'Language/0.8421052631578947']","['Time', 'History', 'Language']",4.374725584013509,"['Society/11.377658942364825', 'Material_Physical/8.605056381526968', 'Individual_Personal/8.439835164835165']","['Society', 'Material_Physical', 'Individual_Personal']",28.422550488726955,"['Urbanization/4.556862745098039', 'Geopolitics/4.026143790849673', 'Culture/3.2615384615384615']","['Urbanization', 'Geopolitics', 'Culture']",11.844544997486175,0.6666666666666666,0.0
Sriwhana Spong,"Inspired by the 1934 novella Duo by the French writer Colette, Spong’s film Beach Study (2012)explores ideas of disappearance and the ephemeral, both physically and psychologically. In the film, a female body conducts abstract dance movements on a beach, responding to the environment that surrounds her. This particular beach was one the artist loved as a child, but today it is hardly accessible because it is in the hands of a private landowner. Shot on 16-millimeter film through colored filters, the film has intense flashes of magenta, violet, and amber, and other flickering “light leak” effects. The female body appears and disappears intermittently, creating a surreal and mysterious presence. The overall effect suggests a precarious relationship between memory and experience, transience and monumentality.","Sriwhana Spong, who lives and works in Auckland, New Zealand, is interested in notions of transition, memory, and translation. Her works investigate the relationships between public and private, the intuitive and the cerebral, the body and its surroundings; often her artworks look at the meaningful dialogues and communications that different art forms “in conversation” can generate. She has a background in dance and choreography, and by manipulating sequences of gestures with the traditions and techniques of filmmaking, Spong investigates how dance movements can register particular events in our collective memories. For Spong, the medium of film is an anthropological tool of inquiry in the search for history, narratives, and constructions of time and space.",Beach Study,Asia,"['movie.n.01', 'body.n.01', 'dance.n.01', 'french.a.01', 'ephemeral.s.01', 'female.a.01', 'private.a.01', 'light.a.01', 'hands.n.01', 'writer.n.01', 'survey.n.01', 'effects.n.01', 'abstract.a.01', 'child.n.01', 'shooting.n.01', 'presence.n.01', 'inspire.v.01', 'environment.n.01', 'relationship.n.01', 'idea.n.01', 'memory.n.01', 'motion.n.03', 'experience.n.01']","['transience.n.01', 'bodied.s.02', 'dance.n.01', 'memory.n.02', 'retrieval.n.02', 'embodiment.n.03']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/sriwhana_spong_beach_study_5_6.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/sriwhana_spong_beach_study_5_6-300x169.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/beach-study/,"['Cultural/7.6274509803921555', 'Material_Physical/5.169561157796452', 'Individual_Personal/1.9333333333333333']","['Cultural', 'Material_Physical', 'Individual_Personal']",14.730345471521941,"['Arts/4.40392156862745', 'Time/2.7904761904761903', 'Mind/1.9333333333333333']","['Arts', 'Time', 'Mind']",9.127731092436974,"['Cultural/27.36483875601523', 'Individual_Personal/23.638095238095243', 'Material_Physical/21.676276664511963']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Material_Physical']",72.67921065862244,"['Mind/9.184615384615386', 'Culture/8.861990950226245', 'Media/7.422649572649572']","['Mind', 'Culture', 'Media']",25.469255907491203,1.0,0.3333333333333333
Hung-Chin Peng,"In Excerpts from the Analects of Confucius, Peng Hung-Chih explores the relationship between Confucianism and religion. Specifically, the piece questions the influence of Confucian teachings on the role of the intellectual in contemporary Chinese society. While Confucianism has its own ritual systems and temples, it is not known to be overly concerned with supernatural beings such as gods and demons. Yet, the video shows a dog making phrases from the Analects appear by licking a wall repeatedly as if the dog is a medium channeling whisperings from an ancient spirit. Although the performance takes on the form of a miraculous apparition brought on by a prodigious dog, Peng Hung-Chih dispels the magical by including the sentence: “Confucius did not talk about prodigies, force, disorders, and gods.” This final statement, in contrast with the video, reveals the ambiguity with which the role of Confucius is received, the towering impact that his teaching and philosophy have had across world reaching a near sacred status.","There is a palpable urgency in the work of Taiwan-based Peng Hung-Chih, who uses video, sculpture, installation, and painting as means to criticize society. As the artist states: “art should be a tool of propaganda, a tool to awaken the collective conscience. This is the only choice under very pressing conditions.” Characterized by a wry and intelligent humour, the cultural commentary relayed by his works has both local universal reach: from aspects of China’s political past and present, to problems of racial and ethnic identity, collective history, spirituality and even our thwarted relationship with the natural world. Several of his works speak of our inability to see outside of our own perspective, as part of a religious or cultural groups, or even as a species. His well-known series Face to Face, for example, consists of sculptures of dogs with small monitors where viewers can watch footage shot from a canine perspective, and his piece The Deluge – Noah’s Ark, a monumental eight-metre-long sinking cruise-ship assembled from over 8,000 3D printed parts, foregrounds the anthropocene. From small gestures to gargantuan statements, Peng Hung-Chih’s works are a timely meditation of the inescapable follies that bind humanity together.",Excerpts from the Analects of Confucius,Asia,"['function.n.03', 'phrase.n.01', 'statement.n.01', 'status.n.01', 'spirit.n.01', 'chinese.a.01', 'bring.v.01', 'ancient.s.01', 'concluding.s.01', 'impact.n.01', 'contrast.n.01', 'video.n.01', 'society.n.01', 'relationship.n.01', 'contemporary.s.01', 'wall.n.01', 'medium.n.01', 'performance.n.01', 'question.n.01', 'piece.n.01', 'form.n.01']","['confucianism.n.01', 'religion.n.02', 'society.n.01', 'supernatural.a.01', 'ritual.n.02', 'doctrine.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/excerpts-analects-confucius-1-1.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/excerpts-analects-confucius-1-1-300x168.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/excerpts-from-the-analects-of-confucius/,"['Individual_Personal/13.744927458162753', 'Cultural/11.828230266465564', 'Society/8.477614379084967']","['Individual_Personal', 'Cultural', 'Society']",34.050772103713285,"['Spirituality/5.314285714285714', 'Mind/5.016636141636141', 'Culture/4.931221719457014']","['Spirituality', 'Mind', 'Culture']",15.262143575378868,"['Cultural/21.121151887328363', 'Society/5.192760180995474', 'Individual_Personal/4.911655011655012']","['Cultural', 'Society', 'Individual_Personal']",31.22556707997885,"['Media/5.992647058823529', 'Fantasy/4.975757575757576', 'Arts/4.416849816849817']","['Media', 'Fantasy', 'Arts']",15.385254451430923,1.0,0.0
Seung-Taek Lee,"Seung-Taek Lee’s work exemplifies a minimalist aesthetic: simple objects like smooth polished stones or a plain pebble-glazed vase become objects of artistic consideration. But rather than simply re-appropriating found objects, Lee stages straightforward but powerful interventions that change our perception of how objects exist in the world while re-activating their functional purpose (or non-purpose, as it may be) by shifting their context away from strict use value and towards aesthetic appreciation. In Tied Stone (1973), for example, Lee feeds thin wire through a center split in a smooth doughnut shaped rock. The wire protrudes from the stone’s center and twists into intricate contortions. A second stone, wrapped simply across the middle in wire, perches atop this twisted wire, suspended above the larger rock with seemingly little support. Lee uses humble materials, and his construction is not elaborate. His seemingly modest works, however, raise poetic questions about balance and the effect of human interventions on natural environments and materials. By attempting to deliberately produce “un-sculptures” without any overt art, Lee resists the dictates of formalism and tries to conceive of a creative practice that is freed from aesthetic conventions. His work is fundamentally about gesture, and his delicate wrappings are more than just minimalist adornments: they are reminders of the artist’s patient and careful interventions, transforming seemingly mundane materials into objects for contemplation.","Seung-Taek Lee produces mixed media and installation-based work that investigates larger questions about materiality. In utilizing seemingly humble materials such as polished stones and industrial wire, Lee creates experimental forms that are in conversation with traditions in Minimalist art while gesturing towards more ancient folk craft techniques in Korea. Lee has exhibited extensively throughout Korea, and his work is increasingly gaining attention of international publications such as Frieze.",Tied Stone,Asia,"['rock.n.01', 'aesthetic.a.01', 'intervention.n.01', 'object.n.01', 'material.n.01', 'center.n.01', 'purpose.n.01', 'creative.a.01', 'percept.n.01', 'poetic.a.01', 'produce.v.01', 'simple.a.01', 'construction.n.01', 'natural.a.01', 'gesture.n.01', 'environment.n.01', 'everyday.s.01', 'practice.n.01', 'human.a.01', 'question.n.01']","['minimalism.n.01', 'object.n.01', 'shape.n.02', 'nature.n.03', 'custom.n.02', 'everyday.s.03']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/seung_taek_lee_tied_stone_web.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/seung_taek_lee_tied_stone_web-300x225.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/tied-stone/,"['Material_Physical/6.415384615384616', 'Society/1.8333333333333335', 'Individual_Personal/1.5692307692307694']","['Material_Physical', 'Society', 'Individual_Personal']",9.817948717948719,"['Space/3.4153846153846157', 'History/1.8333333333333335', 'Environmental/1.0']","['Space', 'History', 'Environmental']",6.24871794871795,"['Cultural/20.058968972204273', 'Material_Physical/19.942032967032976', 'Society/15.002045649568874']","['Cultural', 'Material_Physical', 'Society']",55.003047588806126,"['Culture/7.280860805860806', 'Space/7.203296703296703', 'Arts/5.534640522875817']","['Culture', 'Space', 'Arts']",20.018798032033324,0.6666666666666666,0.3333333333333333
Takahiro Iwasaki,"Tectonic Model is made from a number of leather bound books piled up in different formations that resemble architecture on top of a sawhorse desk.

Takahiro Iwasaki,"Edinburgh Castle on the Bin Bag features a model of the Edinburgh castle constructed by using shiny black cards placed on top of an open, full black plastic trash bag. The model is delicate, with detailed rendering of windows and a flagpole. Despite the negative association of black plastic trash bag, this work offers a sense of wonderment in it its scale and subject matter. The fragile, ephemeral make up of the castle contrasts the casual manner in which the bag is laid. This work was the inspired another “castle work” by Iwasaki, a contribution to Lustwarande ’11, in which a copy of the Tilburg Castle produced from a transparent white produce bag was placed on the branch of a tree.

Andrea Bowers,"The small drawings that comprise Study from May Day March, Los Angeles 2010 (Immigration Reform Now) and We Are Immigrants Not Terrorists are based on photographs taken at a political rally in downtown Los Angeles in which thousands of individuals demonstrated for immigrants’ rights. The protesters and their supporters carried signs and wore t-shirts whose messages are highlighted in the drawings. However, in them, Bowers isolates the images of the protesters from the multitude that surrounds them in the original photographs, and, therefore amplifies their messages. Included in Bowers’s 2010 exhibition, The Political Landscape, these small drawings were part of the project that explored the current problems surrounding the Mexican-American border and the thousands of deaths that result from trying to cross it.","Socially engaged and politically outspoken, Los Angeles-based artist Andrea Bowers builds her work around issues of social justice and advocacy. Her artistic practice often uses political protests and movements as sources of inspiration and content, as she draws isolated figures holding picket signs with delicate attention, or replicates the archive of a cause in the space of the gallery. Labor movements, women’s rights rallies, anti-war protests, and immigration demonstrations, past and present, are among the myriad moments of political action that Bowers draws upon in her works.","Study from May Day March, Los Angeles 2010 (Immigration Reform Now) and We Are Immigrants Not Terrorists",Americas,"['message.n.01', 'drawing.n.01', 'los_angeles.n.01', 'current.a.01', 'supporter.n.01', 'survey.n.01', 'photograph.n.01', 'boundary_line.n.01', 'sign.n.01', 'day.n.01', 'death.n.01', 'original.s.01', 'person.n.01', 'establish.v.08', 'undertaking.n.01', 'political.a.01', 'landscape.n.01', 'image.n.01']","['protest.n.02', 'inequality.n.01', 'march.n.02', 'immigration.n.01', 'boundary_line.n.01', 'politics.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/andrea_bowers_studyfrommaydaymarch_notterrorists.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/andrea_bowers_studyfrommaydaymarch_notterrorists-300x228.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/study-from-may-day-march-los-angeles-2010-immigration-reform-now-and-we-are-immigrants-not-terrorists/,"['Politics/13.72902108211706', 'Society/1.6421052631578947', 'Material_Physical/1.6013071895424837']","['Politics', 'Society', 'Material_Physical']",16.972433534817437,"['Geopolitics/5.3842731829573935', 'Activism/4.636414565826331', 'Inequality/1.8333333333333335']","['Geopolitics', 'Activism', 'Inequality']",11.85402108211706,"['Cultural/10.886161387631976', 'Society/9.214181286549708', 'Individual_Personal/9.011091832144464']","['Cultural', 'Society', 'Individual_Personal']",29.111434506326148,"['Urbanization/3.5614035087719293', 'Culture/3.1076923076923078', 'Time/2.6893106893106893']","['Urbanization', 'Culture', 'Time']",9.358406505774926,0.3333333333333333,0.0

Characteristically unruly, Berman was an active member of the San Francisco and Los Angeles Beat communities in the mid-1950s. In 1963 he settled in Topanga Canyon and started to develop the body of work for which he would become most famous. The verifax machine, a precursor of the photocopy machine, lent the name to the series of collages with which Berman experimented until his death in 1976. The structural compositional element that unifies the series is the image, appropriated from a magazine, of a hand holding a transistor radio. By photocopying and reproducing the image in sequential form on top of the canvas, Berman mimics the pattern produced by an old film reel. Inside the frame of each radio, the artist superimposed imagery—people, objects and symbols, often taken from pop culture—pertinent to that particular sequence of the work.",Untitled (Shuffle),Americas,"['star.n.01', 'opportunity.n.01', 'specific.a.01', 'feature.n.01', 'formal.a.01', 'collage.n.01', 'presence.n.01', 'elements.n.01', 'fictional_character.n.01', 'piece.n.01', 'image.n.01']","['randomness.n.02', 'collage.n.01', 'spirituality.n.02', 'appropriation.n.03', 'photocopy.n.01', 'superimpose.v.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/wallace_berman_shuffle_1969.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/wallace_berman_shuffle_1969-300x275.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/untitled-shuffle/,"['Cultural/9.046631473102062', 'Individual_Personal/1.8421052631578947', 'Society/0.8']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Society']",11.688736736259958,"['Design/3.111111111111111', 'Media/1.75', 'Arts/1.6470588235294117']","['Design', 'Media', 'Arts']",6.508169934640522,"['Material_Physical/14.520859841912475', 'Individual_Personal/13.695355281113798', 'Cultural/9.761161387631976']","['Material_Physical', 'Individual_Personal', 'Cultural']",37.977376510658246,"['Space/8.665548486601118', 'Mind/5.642663219133808', 'Materiality/4.998168498168498']","['Space', 'Mind', 'Materiality']",19.306380203903423,0.6666666666666666,0.0

Liz Cohen,"The photographic work Lowrider Builder and Child is a companion piece to the video Hydroforce, which features Cohen in the late stage of her pregnancy posing atop a German car that she transformed into a lowrider in a period of ten years. While in Hydroforce we see the artist pregnant, Lowrider Builder and Child features the artist’s newborn by her side. In the image, the positioning of Cohen’s body, together with the tranquil, idyllic nature of the site in which she reclines to breastfeed her baby — with the gentle light gleaming as it bounces off the hood of her car — is a nod to classical reclining nude paintings, which invariably portray female subjects.

Euan Macdonald,"The video 9000 PIECES by Euan Macdonald was filmed at a musical instrument factory in Shanghai where 90 percent of the pianos that they manufacture are exported around the world, and only 10 percent are “finished” and can be labeled “Made in the US (or) Europe.” The video captures an intricate network of mechanisms as they interact with each other, their rhythmic movements resulting in an intense choreography and a cacophony of metallic sounds dramatized by Macdonald’s editing. As the shot widens it reveals the process we see unfold: a piano being vigorously tested by a factory machine designed to determine the endurance of the instruments. Contrary to what is often relayed, the work has nothing to do with Chinese factories or fast changing global economies. As described by Macdonald “it’s about the way information is perceived and put together through the connection of looking at different parts of something, and then accumulating them into a larger image.” Perception and temporality are tempered with as the artist directs our focus from the micro to the macro, from the parts to their sum.","Euan Macdonald’s videos, drawings and sculptures are informed by a wide array of philosophical, musical, and literary references, but return repeatedly to the quotidian occurrence, the everyday as subject. Slowness and stillness are set against the relentless race of the cinematic spectacle. Many of his videos present a single conceptual mechanism: art as a machine that proceeds with its own logic, at its own pace, until its operation is complete. But they proceed with a kind of uncertainty, a tension of possible outcomes—a viewers attention shifting between the concrete and the abstract.

Maya Watanabe,"El Contorno (Outlines) is a three-channel video installation that features five actors performing a script—at times individually and at times in unison—choreographically moving across an indistinct urban space. As the view shifts from one performer to another we notice that they are all in close proximity and that the feed from all three channels was simultaneously filmed. The scene unravels with actors moving in and out of view in an elaborate negotiation between their bodies and the camera’s movements. As the title suggests, Watanabe plays with the concept of outlines: between individual actors and a collectively performed script, and between what is left inside and outside of the cinematic frame. As the footage from each channel bleeds from one to the other, Watanabe revokes any fixed notion of identity and space, reformulating them as elements with diffuse boundaries. In El Contorno narration becomes a fragmented map of ideas, space becomes a context without references, and identity becomes a flexible state of being.","Maya Watanabe is a Peruvian artist known for her multi-channel video installations that explore the relationship between the narrated text, individual and collective identity, and space. Framed within the specificity of the medium of film, her early works incorporate references and methodologies from cinematographic language, often involving one or several actors performing a script and interacting with the camera through choreographed movements. The texts narrated by the actors are either borrowed quotes from movies or modified poems and scripts, which become untethered when taken out of their original context. The ambiguity and lack of narrative that results highlights the imprecise nature of our perception and of the images and memories that we rely on for the construction of our identity. Most recently, Watanabe’s exploration has shifted away from the performed script and towards landscapes, due to their ability to allude to the fantastical and relate to different aspects of memory. In her three-channel work Sceneries, for example, she films forgotten wastelands through a series of 360° camera movements that highlight the dramatism and visual richness of terrain that would be otherwise forgotten. Her choice to depict these lands is a reference to the devastated geography that now grips her Peru after decades of destruction from a grueling Civil War—the second largest internal conflict in the history of Latin America. Through the videos of this post-conflict territory she alludes at once to the sombre episode in Peru’s recent history, as well as her memory of it: fragmented and contused.",El Contorno,Americas,"['actor.n.01', 'times.n.01', 'identity.n.01', 'position.n.03', 'space.n.01', 'map.n.01', 'film.v.01', 'perform.v.01', 'leave.v.01', 'footage.n.01', 'concept.n.01', 'individual.a.01', 'urban.a.01', 'frame.n.01', 'impression.n.01', 'elements.n.01', 'mention.n.01', 'idea.n.01', 'context.n.01', 'motion.n.03', 'camera.n.01', 'title.n.01', 'scene.n.01', 'body.n.01', 'narrative.n.01']","['script.n.01', 'performance.n.01', 'space.n.01', 'flexible.a.01', 'choreograph.v.02', 'situation.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/el_contorno_02.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/el_contorno_02-300x100.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/el-contorno/,"['Cultural/5.764835164835165', 'Material_Physical/3.2914529914529917', 'Individual_Personal/2.4333333333333336']","['Cultural', 'Material_Physical', 'Individual_Personal']",11.48962148962149,"['Arts/3.3956043956043955', 'Fantasy/1.6', 'Space/0.8888888888888888']","['Arts', 'Fantasy', 'Space']",5.884493284493285,"['Individual_Personal/37.76660006660007', 'Cultural/24.479846134257905', 'Material_Physical/18.6114414996768']","['Individual_Personal', 'Cultural', 'Material_Physical']",80.85788770053477,"['Values/12.834432234432235', 'Space/8.915715003950298', 'Mind/8.800000000000002']","['Values', 'Space', 'Mind']",30.550147238382536,1.0,0.3333333333333333
Arseniy Zhilyaev,"Arseniy Zhilyaev (born 1984 in Voronezh, Russia) is an artist, writer and political activist who lives and works in Moscow and Voronezh. Zhilyaev’s artistic practice poses questions about the ?ultural production in the postsoviet condition.  To trace Arseniy Zhilyaev’s work, one should span from the avant-garde of the 1920’s to the ‘shock therapy’ of the 1990’s in Russia. As a member of the young generation of Russian artists, Zhilyaev looks at the changes of his country through the 20th century to compose his works. With a specific attention of art’s relations to politics, education and pedagogy, Arseniy Zhilyaev reflects on the different roles of the museum and exhibition making. Despite the current use of art as entertainment, Zhilaev wants to rethink the museum as an educational institution connecting art and history. His references include soviet museology, architecture and design of the avant-garde or experimental exhibition making of the late 1920.  ?????? ??? (delay sam) or “do it yourself” is a work in progress descried by the artist as a research in the tradition of the Soviet and post-Soviet culture of non-professional worker’s folk art. “Usually ordinary people in the Soviet Union had no opportunity to frequently change the furniture according to their taste. But they could do it by themselves! It was during that period that workers’ amateur creativity flourished, exemplified in techniques such as woodcarving, hammered ironwork or amateur furniture design. It was part of free time, type of creative hobby. It was called ‘creative relaxation’. The strict division between work and leisure during the era of late socialism made this creativity possible. It was an extremely democratic art and this is what still inspires me today.”","Arseniy Zhilyaev (born 1984 in Voronezh, Russia) is an artist, writer and political activist who lives and works in Moscow and Voronezh.

Omer Fast,"“Watching the films of Omer Fast confounds our expectations of the medium. 5,000 Feet Is the Best, 2011, is presented like a conventional big-budget Hollywood movie and has similarly high production values. Yet Fast frustrates the narrative element that Hollywood teaches us to expect: While stories unfold, repetitions and obscurities challenge the idea of a central controlling account. Ultimately, one is left with the postmodern awareness that there is no truth, no core to cling to.  Different artists have tackled this central tension between medium and matter in film in different ways. Bill Viola and James Coleman slow down movement and image, while Fast’s approach is more in tune with the fractured expositions that James Joyce employed to disrupt the narrative drive of the novel. The film, which has been playing simultaneously at the Venice Biennale, Dublin Contemporary, and The Model, takes as its subject the drone pilots who remotely operate bomber planes over Afghanistan while working nine-to-five days at their bases in the United States.  The production values are slick, almost to the point of parody, reflecting the aesthetics of blockbuster movies and of those highly glossy prerecession artworks (think of Jeff Koons and his Hanging Heart, 1994–2006) in a way that feels at odds with the content of the film. Nevertheless, Fast’s anti-narrative devices bring about an uncomfortable level of anxiety and perplexed anticipation as we are caught between our expectations of story and what is actually playing out on-screen. These are mirrored in the second installation on view at the Model, Nostalgia, 2009. Nothing seems to make sense as it unfolds, and yet at the end, even though no conclusive story has been told, a greater understanding of humanity appears to have been reached.”  — Gemma Tipton, Artforum","In his videos and installations, Omer Fast links and merges personal stories, collective history reality and fiction as well as experience and one’s making of it. Fast is interested in different types of discourse carried out in contemporary political and social events. In the work CNN concatenated (2002), for instance, an American journalist’s speech is modified to deliver a different meaning. Omer Fast was born in 1972 in Jerusalem, Israel. He lives and works in Berlin.","5,000 Feet",Middle East & Africa,"['movie.n.01', 'model.n.01', 'production.n.01', 'narrative.s.01', 'cardinal.s.01', 'narrative.n.01', 'medium.n.01', 'airplane.n.01', 'aesthetics.n.01', 'conventional.a.01', 'matter.n.01', 'component.n.01', 'repeat.n.01', 'leave.v.01', 'degree.n.01', 'approach.n.01', 'tension.n.01', 'artwork.n.01', 'idea.n.01', 'artist.n.01', 'sense.n.01', 'position.n.03', 'motion.n.03', 'subject.n.01']","['hollywood.n.01', 'moviemaking.n.01', 'military.n.01', 'fiction.n.01', 'falsehood.n.01', 'narrative.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/5000ft_269.1_bd.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/5000ft_269.1_bd-300x169.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/5000-feet/,"['Cultural/17.13482350982351', 'Society/1.8888888888888888', 'Individual_Personal/1.675']","['Cultural', 'Society', 'Individual_Personal']",20.6987123987124,"['Fantasy/11.046911421911423', 'Arts/2.5384615384615383', 'Language/1.7802197802197801']","['Fantasy', 'Arts', 'Language']",15.365592740592742,"['Cultural/43.417653064170075', 'Individual_Personal/26.516405266560074', 'Politics/15.782834159304752']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Politics']",85.71689249003491,"['Arts/13.461086282138917', 'Media/11.692219708396182', 'Mind/9.25506072874494']","['Arts', 'Media', 'Mind']",34.40836671928004,0.6666666666666666,0.3333333333333333
Nguyen Thai Tuan,"In the “Black Paintings” series, although the human body is only suggested, it plays an important role. Some body parts are absent, mostly the faces which are usually an affirmation of the individual. The characters recall ghosts testifying as to the traumas of war. They evoke the absence of oneself, corporal dispossession but also the story of a society still under authoritarian power. In this way, the absence of faces symbolically refers to censorship. The painted characters are overall described in a typology: the only thing we know is if they are men or women; monks, prisoners, or soldiers. The monochrome background accentuates the theatrical aspect of the composition that stages puppets and ghosts. Some of the paintings seem to develop a narration that is left pending, incomplete.  Photography is a manifest reference in the series: testimony to what has occurred, inexorably related to death, absence and loss. The black or dark background creates a space where memory can arise, a space where the stories still need to be written; but also a negative space. “Obscurity always reveals mystery and the unknown. Obscurity forces us to search further and look for the truth, but also creates fear and violence” (Nguyen Thai Tuan).","Nguyen Thai Tuan was born in 1965, he studied at the school of Fine Arts of Hue where he studied propaganda art, which he got bored of very quickly. He is one of the most important Vietnamese artists of his generation that remained and worked in his country, while many other artists were trained in the United States.  His work questions the history and fragility of humanist values and the affirmation of subjectivity in opposition to political power. He produced several series of paintings, among which is Heritage that shows in the background buildings and monuments related to Vietnamese history. He seeks to portray a critical space between the past and the present.",Black Painting No. 52,Asia,"['ghost.n.01', 'background.n.01', 'narrative.n.01', 'fictional_character.n.01', 'space.n.01', 'soldier.n.01', 'body.n.01', 'force.n.01', 'unknown.a.01', 'loss.n.01', 'injury.n.01', 'fear.n.01', 'leave.v.01', 'black.n.01', 'aspect.n.01', 'write.v.01', 'death.n.01', 'violence.n.01', 'series.n.01', 'person.n.01', 'photography.n.01', 'society.n.01', 'composition.n.01', 'function.n.03', 'war.n.01']","['censoring.n.01', 'communist.n.01', 'trauma.n.02', 'war.n.01', 'memory.n.01', 'grief.n.02']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/black_painting_no.52._2008_bd.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/black_painting_no.52._2008_bd-255x300.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/black-painting-no-52/,"['Individual_Personal/6.8791208791208796', 'Society/6.217760180995475', 'Cultural/4.0307692307692315']","['Individual_Personal', 'Society', 'Cultural']",17.127650290885587,"['War/2.75', 'Emotion/2.7142857142857144', 'Violence/2.6985294117647056']","['War', 'Emotion', 'Violence']",8.16281512605042,"['Individual_Personal/23.334951632474862', 'Society/16.128497809380164', 'Material_Physical/12.96506008611272']","['Individual_Personal', 'Society', 'Material_Physical']",52.42850952796775,"['Emotion/11.343223443223446', 'Space/8.07714799820063', 'Violence/7.266079508726567']","['Emotion', 'Space', 'Violence']",26.68645095015064,0.6666666666666666,0.6666666666666666
Bernard Piffaretti,"Bernard Piffaretti was born in 1955 in Saint-Etienne. He graduated from the school of Fine Arts of Saint-Etienne, and he now lives and works in Paris while expanding his carrier internationally.  Like On Kawara, Stanley Brouwn or Roman Opalka, Bernard Piffaretti is also a “protocol artist”. He has imposed a few restrictions on his work, resulting in a protocol set as of 1986, which the artist has followed from then on. It is called the “Piffaretti System.”  Piffaretti’s work is based on a system of duplication on a single canvas. The painter starts painting indifferently on the left or right side of the canvas, and reproduces the result from memory on the other side, separating both sides by a central vertical line.  An image is produced – which is neither the model, nor the copy. It is impossible to perceive which one of the two patterns was the first one. They are both similar like approximate clones. There is no first time. The story stutters as of the beginning.  Without any stylistic unit, Bernard Piffaretti’s paintings are very different from one another. The protocol suspends time. The opposition copy/original disappears.","Bernard Piffaretti was born in 1955 in Saint-Etienne.

Koki Tanaka,"This artwork was part of a group of projects presented in the Japanese Pavilion at the Venice Biennale in 2013. These videos show several participants from different backgrounds gathering to create and object or an action. For this video, he brought together five Japanese poets from different movements and styles. It is very clear and more perceptible in this project than in others of the series (amongst which hairdressers in San Francisco and potters in China are brought together), that it is difficult to leave space to the others.  Considered for a long time as the symbol of ultimate creation, the composition of a poem is an extremely personal activity. Japanese society is often seen as very individualistic. Here, Tanaka presents us with the utopia of a micro community, which could be the plinth to the creation of a larger community. Documenting the production process is also a rebellious act against the result or the object itself. Incidentally, the installation is also composed of four drawing-poems, all different, without one ideal or perfect result.","Koki Tanaka is part of a generation of Japanese artists whose work responded to the economic recession and limited opportunities that beset their country in the early 2000s. Instead of creating monuments, these artists focused on everyday life, transforming the ordinary into the extraordinary by stimulating moments of perceptual awakening. Their social critique was enacted through the spectacular and unexpected combination of materials, humor, and simple actions.

Adrien Missika,"Adrien Missika follows in the footsteps of the Brazilian landscape architect and artist Roberto Burle Marx (1909-1994), a designer of gardens, parks and promenades  who introduced modern landscape architecture to Brazil. Marx’s work is characterized by the use of native tropical vegetation as a structural element of design. He worked with Oscar Niemeyer and Lucio Costa, the architects of Brazilia, and with them, the tropical plant became a motif in urban architecture. His garden in Guaratiba or the Copacabana mosaic walk in Rio, are some of his well-known interventions.  Like the Brazilian landscape architect and artist Roberto Burle Marx who, sensitive to the temporal and ephemeral nature of architecture and civilizations, readily recycled architectural elements for his creations, Adrien Missika recovered the windows of a 60s Geneva building to be demolished and used them in a new context. On some of them, he placed images of palm, banana and pineapple leaves were placed, which the artist had scanned with a hand scanner, as a radical hyper-technological and manual way to record the reality and to bring back images from his travels. Using the figure of the 19th century explorer and scientist, the leaf isn’t kept for a collection but recorded to become an architectural motif. Here, the window doesn’t offer a perspective on a landscape but is only serves as memorabilia of what Nature was.","Adrien Missika (1981, Paris, France) studied and developed his career in Lausanne where he founded 1m3 artspace. Adrien Missika uses a wide range of media (photography, video, installation) to share his findings from travels in the USA, Hawaii, Turkmenistan, India, Lebanon, Brazil, to name a few. Missika portrays himself as a ‘professional tourist’ and his work plays on the idea of an exotic representation of these localities. There, he would look for natural elements (rocks, plants, lava) as much as iconic architecture such as Niemeyer’s dome in Tripoli (Lebanon), that he sometimes activates, records and transforms for the mediated experience of the gallery space.",Botanical Frottage (Lauren),Europe,"['architecture.n.01', 'motif.n.01', 'architectural.a.01', 'landscape.n.01', 'nature.n.01', 'ephemeral.s.01', 'native.a.01', 'bring.v.01', 'component.n.01', 'plant.n.01', 'creation.n.01', 'intervention.n.01', 'design.n.01', 'modern.a.01', 'century.n.01', 'urban.a.01', 'hand.n.01', 'building.n.01', 'elements.n.01', 'image.n.01', 'position.n.03', 'context.n.01', 'world.n.03', 'figure.n.01']","['architecture.n.02', 'leaf.n.01', 'window.n.01', 'nature.n.03', 'explorer.n.01', 'tropical.s.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/missika_botanical_frottage_lauren_web.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/missika_botanical_frottage_lauren_web-200x300.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/botanical-frottage-lauren/,"['Cultural/12.493412452700381', 'Material_Physical/5.970940170940171', 'Individual_Personal/3.23486544415337']","['Cultural', 'Material_Physical', 'Individual_Personal']",21.69921806779392,"['Arts/5.230994152046784', 'Technology/4.083333333333333', 'Space/2.6153846153846154']","['Arts', 'Technology', 'Space']",11.929712100764732,"['Cultural/33.284635136105734', 'Individual_Personal/19.265653953889252', 'Society/17.289255189255194']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Society']",69.83954427925019,"['Arts/16.146631473102065', 'Culture/7.041758241758242', 'Mind/5.534065934065934']","['Arts', 'Culture', 'Mind']",28.722455648926243,0.6666666666666666,0.3333333333333333
Pablo Pijnappel,"In Felicitas, we follow the converging routes of three characters: Felicitas, Michael and Andrew (the artist’s father-in-law who also features elsewhere). Felicitas is thedaughter of a German industrialist who immigrated to Rio after the Second World War. She is the one visible with a toucan in several images. In his work, Pablo Pijnappel privileges pre-existing images – the slides presented here are photographs found in his family archives or from other sources (media, photographs of film sets…). Sometimes, the same image is used several times with a different caption, thus encapsulating other meanings. Presented in the form of an installation with three synchronized slide projectors, Felicitas offers a complex scenario, where text and images can simultaneously be descriptive, intermingled or completely autonomous. Disjunctions and repetitions create the pace: the captioned images appear one after the other, with no regular order, sometimes on the left, in the centre or on the right. Even though the story follows a certain chronology, it is not linear and looks more like a complex collage of images and anecdotes which overlap. The text does not illustrate the images but functions as a complement that allows for the creation of multiple readings of the characters, of their lives, their trips and encounters. These collages are a mixture of real and fictional stories that enable Pijnappel to play with the notion of the documentary. The subtitles are in an informative tone, but they are mostly subjective and imagined commentaries thus creating what can be called a documentary fiction. This artwork has cinematographic qualities while deconstructing those conventions. Chris Marker’s film La jetée in which the relation between voice-over and still images creates a space for free interpretation was a likely direct influence.","Pablo Pijnappel’s work is foremost highly constructed. He builds narrations based on anecdotes and everyday events, perhaps souvenirs, family legends or plain fictions. The non-linear use of different archives and film extracts highlights this uncertainty and contributes to the loss of these stories over time. The works only offer pauses and silent moments, allowing the investment of our imagination. The ‘life stories’ told by Pablo Pijnappel are often those of his family who travelled a lot and had to adapt to new countries and their cultures. Through his tales, we visit Brazil in the 1940s, Japan, the United Kingdom and also Germany.

Jonathan Monk,"Untitled (rolled up), is an abstract portrait of Owen Monk, the artist’s father and features an aluminum ring of 56.6 cm in diameter measuring 1.77 cm in circumference, the size of his father. Jonathan Monk bridges a conceptual art and his family privacy, and ironically ensures that there is “no difference between Sol Lewitt and my mother, he does not know more than she do not know. ” What is the status of the O-backed chair rail to the white cube? Monk gives us some clues. The O is an initial, the letter contains the first letter of Owen. The O is also a sign, the letter contains the restaurant sign Owen. The O of Untitled (rolled up) is thought of as an encrypted letter. The work, while it appears as a joke (?), plays upon everything. Monk questions the meaning of a work through non-conventional logic.","To enter an exhibition by Jonathan Monk is like taking part of a treasure hunt, made up by digressions and space-time manipulations. In his “Meeting pieces” (a wall text in the exhibition space indicating an appointment in the distant future), the meeting is uncertain. The amount and variety of his works, poses the question of what supports them. Monk’s art does not follow any style, there is no characteristic that could help to identify his work at first glance.

John Menick,"The theme of the end of the world, of the last man on earth, recurs in our literary and cinematographic culture and in our imaginary: “we had this dream before, the dream that we’re alone.”  In The Secret Life of Things, the narrator presents himself as an enthusiast and expert on films announcing the end of the world and those staging someone waking up to discover that they are the only survivor on earth. Like in some works by Mario Garcia Torres (like The Transparencies of the Non-Act, a slide projection about the artist Oscar Neuestern, Kadist Collection), the artist lends his discourse to a stranger. Mastering the montage, he intersperses a monologue and images. A suite of extracts that intersect with his discourse highlight the recurrence of the theme in cinema: from René Clair and “Paris qui dort” (1924), to “The Last Men on Earth” (1964) or “The Omega Man” (1971). These themes recur in European literary and cinematographic culture and in the imaginary: “we used to have this dream before, the dream that we were alone”. They were greatly developed in the 1960s and 1970s, allowing the expression of concerns of the time (the atomic bomb in Hiroshima, Cold War threats) through fiction. From the beginning of the video, one has a glimpse of Paris, and then other cities, empty, with abandoned buildings, roads and monuments. More than a filmography of the end of the world, the narrator explains that this obsession is linked to things: “I watched these movies for their things, the massive accumulation of things”. What will become of these objects, cars, houses when they have lost their users? He continues to say that these objects have another use, another identity, ‘a secret life’. Finally he admits that “The story of the future is therefore in our present”. Above all, these announcing films are the witnesses of our history.","Rather like the narrator in the video belonging to the Kadist collection, The secret life of things, the artist John Menick is a ‘professional spectator’. He has written numerous texts on cinema and art which he publishes on his blog or in magazines. The artist, who has remained outside the art market, is recognized by numerous institutions and has exhibited at Maison Rouge (Paris), Laboratoires d’Aubervilliers, PS1 (New York), Artists Space (New York), CCA Wattis Institute (San Francisco), Midway Contemporary Art (Minneapolis). John Menick was born in 1976 in White Plains, New York.

Dora Garcia,"Dora Garcia’s work is a result of institutional critique and more generally that of language, following the conceptual artists of the 1960s like Weiner and Kosuth and Fraser from the 1980s and 1990s. What a fucking wonderful audience (2008) is positioned conveniently at the crossroads of several trends identified in the work of the artist.  The performance from which it is derived, was made at the Biennale of Sydney in 2008, taking the form of a guided tour at the Museum of Modern Art in Sydney and focuses on artworks that were not physically present. A performer acts as a traditional museum guide and offers visitors a guided tour that comments on several controversial works from art and film history like “Cosmococa” by Oiticica, “Kunst Kick “by Chris Burden, “The Society of Spectacle” by Guy Debord.  In the script of the tour guide, Garcia makes connections between these works and various authors whose approach was to question the position of the viewer and the artist within the institution. Included in the work are annotated framed index cards originating from the performance in Sydney.  The printed text includes text written entirely by Dora Garcia, while the annotations stem from the performer, who clarifies or contradicts the discourse of the artist and uses it for his tour. The framed photograph documents the performance. Garcia never carries out personal performances, rather, she commissions professional actors. Being in relative distance to the viewer, she establishes a distinct relationship between performer and audience. This performance matches up to projects like The Beggar’s Opera, presented at the Skulptur Projekte de Münster for which the artist spoiled the expectations of the visitors. For those who continued to search for a sculpture by Dora Garcia, they found instead an actor playing the role of a beggar whose adventures were recorded on a blog.","Dora Garcia was born in 1965 in Valladolid, Spain.

Elizabeth McAlpine,"Elizabeth McAlpine’s work frequently deals with time based issues as well as the experience of watching. In The Height of the Campanile , McAlpine has calculated the height of the tower and timed her shooting of it so that the length of the film in meters is exactly that of the height of the tower. Thus the time it takes to view the film, and the pace at which the camera pans up the tower are equivalent to the height of the tower.  The image, which is quite grainy, is projected postcard-size, on the wall and the film loops back inside a specially constructed glass structure. The size of the projection, reminds the viewer that Venice has become, above all, a tourist destination. The use of 8 mm cine film recalls the way in which, prior to the invention of video, tourists would record their holidays on film for playback in the home. If the technology has a period feel, the mesmerising continuous loop suggests a certain timelessness that the visitor to Venice appreciates when standing in front in San Marco.  Thus while much of McAlpine’s work is based on edits, repetitions and sequencing, here she has made a piece that apparently is simply a continuous shot: far from being fragmented it is a whole.","Elizabeth McAlpine has described herself as a « fanatical geologist » who explores the different layers of cinematic footage.  Her works use a variety of film media, for example excerpts from feature films or found footage. Researching instances of repetitions in found media, she combines them to reveal new meanings, sometimes using a structure related to other forms of artistic expression. McAlpine looks at the ways in which we process and absorb film as well as transforming extracts into rather painterly images. She examines the way in which cinema acts upon the mind making the subliminal liminal. All her films explore issues related to time (real and film), editing, continuity and rupture. McAlpine’s work reflects the mediated world in which we live and looks at ways in which our cultural constructs are based on repetition and similarities.Elizabeth McAlpine was born in London in 1973.

Lars Laumann,"Eija Riitta was born in 1954 in Liden, Sweden, and is “objectum-sexual.” Since June 17, 1979, her name is Eija Riitta Berliner Mauer taking the name of her husband, the Berlin Wall. In animism all elements of nature are considered as alive and have souls.  “Objectum-sexuality” is an extension of this belief. Eija’s blog explains the situation perfectly – her attraction to rectangular parallel lines, constructions such as bridges, fences or the Berlin Wall. Furthermore, this can be witnessed at her house, now the “Museum of models and guillotines,” a subject that she is equally passionate about. More than a documentary on the subject, Lars Laumann filmed the encounter between two lovers of the Berlin Wall. In the video, we come to realize that the first woman married the wall before the war, clinging to the memory of what it was, while the second fell in love with the Berlin Wall after its destruction. Surprisingly, these women do not consider the wall as a symbol of political history, but more as an independent object of history. The first woman fell love with the wall for its lines, its strength, its breadth, while the other for its colors, its fragmentation, and its fragility. In presenting this film in an artistic context, Laumann makes a surprising parallel between “objectum-sexuality” and art. To contemplate a work for its formal aspects, refers to Eija’s speech which considers the Berlin Wall as a free being, without any responsibility of which he is charged. Thus, the destruction of the wall, as Eija claims, is as an act of barbarism, of an innocent person.","The films of Lars Laumann incorporate codes of documentary, grappling with topics at the limits of fiction. This process of fictional documentary recalls the practices some artists in the Kadist collection like Omer Fast, Joachim Koester, John Menick, Akram Zaatari, Arthur Zmijewski. In 2007, Matthew Higgs presented, at White Columns Gallery (New York), Laumann’s first film, “Morrissey Foretelling the Death of Diana” which claims that the Smiths album “Queen is Dead” produced in 1986, announces the death of Princess Diana in 1997 in Paris. Illustrated in a film montage, the narrator’s discourse draws parallels between the surprising words belonging to pop culture and events that occurred years later. Lars Laumann’s analysis takes as a starting point the iconic figure of Diana, and develops a “conspiracy theory” by claiming extraterrestrial involvement in those events, thus offering a vision of a world entirely controlled.

Omer Fast,"In this work, Omer Fast probes the feelings experienced by young people involved in an acts of war. Four monitors installed in the form a chariot of war relay the words and faces of four young Israeli soldiers. The installation shows a young generation confronted by the reality of danger, whether being attacked or facing death. The external situation of war lies is in parallel with their inner thoughts of the soldiers who fear a possibility of error in their actions. The intensity of the situation is not revealed by disaster shots nor depictions of ruins, but rather is revealed through their expressions. Omer Fast questions the words used to translate this experience by tweaking lightly the subtitles of their testimonies, and therefore creates a shift of meaning and implied subtext.","In his videos and installations, Omer Fast links and merges personal stories, collective history reality and fiction as well as experience and one’s making of it. Fast is interested in different types of discourse carried out in contemporary political and social events. In the work CNN concatenated (2002), for instance, an American journalist’s speech is modified to deliver a different meaning. Omer Fast was born in 1972 in Jerusalem, Israel.

Maaike Schoorel,"This is one of the most important works Schoorel has made to date, a triptych that has as its subject matter a garden scene with what looks like a pond. One of her largest works, it seems highly suited to a Parisian collection where Monet’s Nympheas in the Orangerie represent the summit of treatments of such subjects. Typically for Schoorel, the painting is as much about absence as presence and examines the amount of information the viewer needs to construct meaning. Delicate stains and touches of paint describe the subject which is contingent and evanescent. These are paintings that require slow readings, allowing the eye to adjust and to assemble information. Time is an important theme in the work; not simply the time it takes to decipher it but time associated with memory, a faculty the painting appears to emblematize. Like all Schoorel’s work, the painting is based on a photograph and therefore a scene she experienced. The temporality of the work is not that of the camera from which the image is derived, but that of painting itself. The Garden was shown in “Visible Invisible : Against the Security of the Real” at Parasol Unit, London from November 2009 to February 2010.","Based on photographs and domestic environments, Maaike Schoorel’s paintings are charged with an atmosphere of melancholy and loss. In her paintings images emerge slowly. Her figurative paintings appear faded or bleached with brush strokes that suggest outlines and restrained marks that imply areas of colour or shadow. The viewer must participate in the paintings, employing a particular way of looking that allows the images to unravel slowly over time. The spaces they provide are not only physical, but also conceptual – the freedom to find pleasure in their beauty, or to find consolation in the way in which they transform memory from an image of yesterday into a fresh, present-day experience.",The Garden,Europe,"['subject.n.01', 'time.n.01', 'scene.n.01', 'reading.n.01', 'eye.n.01', 'invisible.a.01', 'capable.s.02', 'matter.n.01', 'paint.n.01', 'visible.a.01', 'presence.n.01', 'construct.v.01', 'meaning.n.01', 'establish.v.08', 'memory.n.01', 'camera.n.01', 'spectator.n.01', 'photograph.n.01', 'image.n.01']","['garden.n.01', 'absence.n.01', 'time.n.05', 'faint.s.05', 'evanescent.s.01', 'stain.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/img-742.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/img-742-300x152.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/the-garden/,"['Material_Physical/6.379084967320262', 'Society/2.3777777777777778']","['Material_Physical', 'Society']",8.75686274509804,"['Time/3.6666666666666665', 'History/2.3777777777777778', 'Immaterial/1.0']","['Time', 'History', 'Immaterial']",7.044444444444444,"['Cultural/13.916930618401206', 'Material_Physical/13.43415212238742', 'Individual_Personal/11.492796092796093']","['Cultural', 'Material_Physical', 'Individual_Personal']",38.84387883358472,"['Mind/5.734065934065934', 'Culture/4.615384615384616', 'Materiality/4.3168498168498175']","['Mind', 'Culture', 'Materiality']",14.666300366300367,0.4,0.0
Dominique Petitgand,"A woman pronounces parts of sentences. Via rigorous editing, the artist creates  anticipation with the silences, rhythm by the repetitions, temporal ellipses with music. The recording is diffused by a loud speaker placed on a plinth which gives the whole an anthropomorphic status which reminds one of Box with the sound of its own making by Robert Morris. “For me this is an emblematic piece of work. In fact Le bout de la langue could be the generic title of a large part of my work. Seemingly […] everything is obvious: the mental process along the way, speech is captured by disfunctional memory”. (« Notes, voix, entretiens », page 97). This metalinguistic artwork questions language in its relation to memory (blanks or losses) via fixed expressions: “Don’t you see, I can’t remember […] I have it on the tip of my tongue and it annoys me, […] Don’t you see what I mean”. The density of the silences emphasizes the failing memory, the voice can only be quiet. Petitgand’s characters spend their time trying to make an inventory, to classify, to order. Somewhere between a soliloquy and a monologue, the spoken sequences reintroduce a certain communication with the spectator who can become emotionally involved or have their imagination stimulated.","Dominique Petitgand makes sound pieces.  “I can’t make audible the world in its entirety. Only what is in motion, in action, animated, agitated or touched. To capture the presence of a tree, I need wind or an announcement saying ‘tree’ (always in an indirect mode)”, as the artist explained (in his book The missing pieces).version anglaise p.21 Snippets of recorded conversations are assembled and edited with blanks in the dialogues, background sounds (surround sound, bodily sounds) and music. In some more abstract works like Exhalaisons (Exhalations), the human being becomes a fragment reduced to the noise of a mouth or to breathing – a presence remains. The artist uses different modes of listening depending on the exhibition context, from domestic distribution (records, books) to public diffusion (concerts, installations). In terms of propagation in space, sound has no limits whereas images can only exist within its own limits (the frame).

Hu Yun,"This research-based artwork acts as a memorial to early twentieth century European exploration of China. An antique open suitcase reveals a pile of rubbings and an air-dried peony, while projected photographs of the Chinese landscape appear as a slideshow on the gallery wall. The artifacts refer to a 1908-1909 expedition of naturalists, missionaries, and colonists to the west of China, which ended abruptly with the death of one of the travelers by unusual circumstances. The installation complicates notions of time, history, fact, and subjectivity by including readymade European artifacts with photographs made by Hu Yun’s own grandfather and a bell in the corner of the gallery that summons an attendant to recite a fairytale for the viewer. Individual experience cannot be separated from historical account, while past events cannot be separated from their context within the present moment.","Shanghai-based artist Hu Yun works in various media, including graphite, watercolor, installation, video, and performance.

Javier Castro,"In the video Negro sobre Negro (Black on Black) all we see is a completely black screen on a monitor that is recessed into a wall, also painted black. Gradually, the face of a man becomes visible as he steps out of the darkness and closer to the camera. As suggested by Castro, the color of this man’s skin allows him to pass unnoticed perhaps literally, but also metaphorically as he alludes with certain humor to the iconic work Black Square by Suprematist artist Kazimir Malevich, often referred to as the “zero point of painting” in Western art-historical discourses. Analogously, in Castro’s related work Blanco sobre Blanco (White on White), we see a white man appearing in a white screen embedded into a white wall— in this case, alluding to Malevich’s White on White series. Together, these works have a conversation: both of them appropriating Malevich’s monochromatic compositions, and conflating formalist discourses with racial and identity politics. Adding to the complexity of these works is the preference that art schools across Cuba and Latin America have given to Western discourses, inferiorizing artistic production from outside the West. Seen through this prism, Castro’s pieces are a poetic and provocative take on resolving formalism from within a body of colour.","Javier Castro was born in the in the neighbourhood of San Isidro in the heart of Habana Vieja, Cuba, where he lives and works. Influenced by the unique historical and present idiosyncrasies that define his neighbourhood—which is famous both as the site of José Martí’s (poet and martyr of the war for independence from Spain) childhood home, and the birthplace and murder of Alberto Yarini, a Cuban pimp, racketeer, and heroic symbol of Cuban identity—he films daily scenes from this area of the city, studying its tensions with an anthropological eye. Although he has previously worked in several media including installation and photography, he grew interested in video because of its ability portray the vitality of the present moment in the most immediate way possible. For Castro, it’s essential to capture reality in its most raw and unadulterated form, and hence he uses as little equipment as possible—no lights, sets or scripts—in order to preserve the natural dynamics of an environment. As a consequence, the people we see in his videos are never subject to artificial conditions. As described by Castro, the neighbourhood is his studio and his role as an artist is not to produce work, but rather to find and capture it without touching it. The social dimension of his practice is also important for Castro. At its very core, his work is about the people that he depicts and his own interrelations with them as another inhabitant of Habana Vieja. It’s this closeness and familiarity that allows him to earn his subjects’ trust, which ultimately leads to their honest portrayal. From his interactions with people emerge questions that speak of the human condition: the economy, language, sexuality, and violence all entangled in the stories of sociality and survival in Havana.",Negro sobre Negro (Black on Black),Americas,"['white.n.01', 'discourse.n.01', 'black.n.01', 'western.a.01', 'white.a.01', 'screen.n.01', 'black.a.01', 'west.n.01', 'square.n.01', 'dark.n.01', 'complexity.n.01', 'school.n.01', 'conversation.n.01', 'united_states.n.01', 'politics.n.01', 'iconic.a.01', 'visible.a.01', 'production.n.01', 'poetic.a.01', 'color.n.01', 'composition.n.01', 'identity.n.01', 'wall.n.01', 'camera.n.01', 'piece.n.01']","['formalism.n.01', 'suprematism.n.01', 'postmodernist.a.01', 'race.n.03', 'square.n.01', 'identity.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/javier_castro_negro_sobre_negro_1_web.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/javier_castro_negro_sobre_negro_1_web-300x274.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/negro-sobre-negro-black-on-black/,"['Individual_Personal/11.496509209744508', 'Cultural/1.6470588235294117', 'Politics/0.875']","['Individual_Personal', 'Cultural', 'Politics']",14.018568033273919,"['Identity/5.7979797979797985', 'Mind/2.423529411764706', 'Spirituality/1.6']","['Identity', 'Mind', 'Spirituality']",9.821509209744503,"['Material_Physical/14.176745786033715', 'Individual_Personal/11.139005439005443', 'Society/10.364957264957267']","['Material_Physical', 'Individual_Personal', 'Society']",35.68070848999643,"['Land/6.658344579397211', 'Identity/6.43131313131313', 'Language/3.91025641025641']","['Land', 'Identity', 'Language']",16.99991412096675,0.3333333333333333,0.3333333333333333
Oded Hirsch,"Oded Hirsch’s video work Nothing New (2012) utilizes seemingly absurdist tropes to raise more trenchant questions about communal action and collective identity in modern day Israel. In the video, a fallen parachutist hangs tangled by his own lines, suspended between two electrical towers in a surreally desolate landscape of overgrown fields in the Jordan Valley of Israel. A group of over a hundred men and women approach the towers, working with almost mechanic efficiency to free the parachutist from the power lines overhead. Although the subject of a would-be rescue mission, it is never clear if the parachutist survived the fall – seemingly inanimate, he functions more as an object of convergence to bring the various actors on the ground together. Filmed near the Jordanian border with Israel, the video considers multiple iterations of borderlands – from the geo-political borders between nation states to the border between life and death occupied by the endangered parachutist – while also suggesting how these intermediate spaces can be static. Hirsch’s work, however, suggests that complacency can only be countered by communal effort and action. We never know the outcome of the groups’ attempt to save the parachutist, and this ambiguity troubles our desire and expectation for resolution. But in foregrounding the imperative need for collective response, Hirsch stakes out a critical space for shared experiences driven by empathy while advocating for greater common awareness and understanding.","Oded Hirsch produces video, installation, and photography that explore the phenomena of collective experience and participatory spectacle in present day Israel. Born and raised in Kibbutz Afikim, Israel, Hirsch examines how group structures function as a point of departure for deeper considerations of circumstance, choice, and communal action. Often removed from logic and reason, his videos show conflict and resolution as contemporaneous and co-essential phenomenon. While his works occasionally employ absurd tropes to disorienting effect, his narratives focus on situations that invite collective response, shared experience, and greater consciousness of the world around us.

Oliver Laric,"Oliver Laric’s video Versions is part of an ongoing body of work that has continued to evolve and mutate over time. Comprised of several video and sculptural works that share the same title, the Versions series reflects Laric’s key concerns: the mutability of images and objects and the negotiation between original and copy. In this video, we see several 3D renders of recognizable objects and places, while an ubiquitous feminized robotic voice that evokes the domestic familiarity of voice recognition tools such as Siri and Alexa, speaks of issues relating to identity, language, and translation. Formally, these concepts are reflected through strategies of doubling, mirroring, translating, transferring and mimicking: images of ancient Greek busts are reproduced in postal stamps for Mali and Peru; two popular Disney characters dancing side by side reveal how the same motion was used for both of them; and iconic basketball moments are immortalized both through photographs and interpretations in Manga comics. In addition to the formal strategies, there’s an array of historical references that bring the same concerns to the fore, including a piece by piece architectural render of the Ise Shrine, which is demolished and rebuilt every 20 years as part of Shinto belief system of death, renewal, and the impermanence of all things. Another key reference that appears in many of Laric’s videos and sculptural works is the bust of Chinese military strategist Sun Tzu, Laric’s interest centered around the proliferation of adaptations of his ancient military treatise Art of War, which have been disseminated globally.","Oliver Laric is a Berlin-based, Austrian multimedia artist whose work is centered around issues of authorship, originality, and ownership—with a specific interest in visual culture in the digital age. His work and broad research addresses an ongoing history of the mutability of objects and images. From ideas of copyright to examples of iconoclasm (the destruction of religious iconography), Laric’s focus is on how objects and images are continually re-represented, appropriated, remixed, augmented and modified.  Several of Laric’s work evolve over time, at times relying on the voracious contribution of online communities. From 2006–2012, for example, Laric was part of the project VVORK, an art blog as exhibition space, which gained a large following and led to the group working as a curatorial collective. He has also collaborated with a range of museums to make 3D scans of sculptures available and free to download online. Even his own sculptural practice is often based on versions of classical and neoclassical sculptures, which he then reinterprets. His interest in reinscribing or opening up material, however, is not in the new or hybrid objects that result, but rather the moment of transfer, the metamorphosis of objects into other objects or images, and the endless potential of mutability. That is what Laric tries to capture.",Versions,Europe,"['scheme.n.01', 'ancient.s.01', 'version.n.01', 'military.a.01', 'sculptural.a.01', 'voice.n.01', 'cardinal.s.01', 'mention.n.01', 'video.n.01', 'object.n.01', 'ongoing.s.01', 'chinese.a.01', 'architectural.a.01', 'tool.n.01', 'formal.a.01', 'interpretation.n.01', 'popular.a.01', 'concept.n.01', 'issue.n.01', 'death.n.01', 'original.s.01', 'language.n.01', 'war.n.01', 'moment.n.01', 'historical.a.01']","['master.n.06', 'writing.n.01', 'transformation.n.01', 'translation.n.01', 'duplicate.v.01', 'mirror.v.02']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/oliver_laric_versions_web.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/oliver_laric_versions_web-300x219.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/versions/,"['Cultural/9.103399524452156', 'Material_Physical/3.3365384615384617', 'Society/1.5692307692307694']","['Cultural', 'Material_Physical', 'Society']",14.009168755221387,"['Arts/4.804151404151404', 'Media/2.4571428571428573', 'Time/1.7980769230769231']","['Arts', 'Media', 'Time']",9.059371184371184,"['Individual_Personal/21.305494505494515', 'Cultural/18.684665661136254', 'Society/6.248529411764705']","['Individual_Personal', 'Cultural', 'Society']",46.23868957839548,"['Mind/10.616117216117217', 'Culture/7.884615384615384', 'Values/5.755311355311354']","['Mind', 'Culture', 'Values']",24.256043956043953,0.6666666666666666,0.0
Amapola Prada,"In the video Unit/y we see Amapola Prada in the center of the screen wearing an oversized, worn out sweatshirt, socks and flip-flops—standing motionless on a dimly lit street in her native Lima, Peru. As the video progresses, people, stray dogs, and cars pass by unbeknown to her presence, inescapably fulfilling their roles in the everyday.  The title of the work gives us a clue. In Spanish, ‘unidad’ can be used to refer to both, a single unit or to the term ‘unity’—the coming together of many. This play on words signals one of the artist’s key concerns: the tension between the individual and the collective, and how our bodies mediate between these contrasting forces. In the case of unit/y, Prada withholds movement to enunciate her presence as an individual in the face of an unfolding cityscape that is perpetually in motion.  Unit/y, alongside the works Movement, and Power, forms part of the video triptych Revolution, where Prada investigates ideas commonly associated with the concept of ‘revolution.’ Contrasting the connotations these words carry with archetypal and symbolic situations, Prada proposes a revolution that departs from the body, advocating for “the acceptance of ourselves and our circumstances past and present, without pretenses or glories.”","As the daughter of an actor, Amapola Prada recalls frequently attending the theater as a child and noticing that she never saw herself (her body or reality) represented. On the same vein, during her studies in the field of Social Psychology at university, she noticed the lack of inclusion of non-Western subjectivities—mestizos, Indigenous, migrants among them—and their bodies across all the texts and theories she encountered.

Amapola Prada,"n the opening scene of the video Power (La Fuerza) we see a mature woman asleep in a dark room. Prada slowly becomes visible as she crawls into the bed and affectionately positioning her body next to the sleeping figure. Prada then proceeds to undress the woman’s chest and ‘feed’ from her breast. The surreal, dream-like quality of the scene brings to mind Freudian Psychoanalysis and its conception of maternal relations: an Oedipal complex of sorts. Prada accordingly inserts her body as a Peruvian woman into a discourse that has historically and in present-day invisibilized non-Western subjectivities—asserting her connection with her mother as a source of nourishment and strength.  This is not the first time Amapola Prada has featured her parents in order to explore aspects of the body and the familial. In her own words: “The work of resolving previous generations is concentrated in my body. Through my parents, I connect with these generations, and with them, I intend to traverse conflict. When I move, they move; when they move, I move; when we ourselves move, we also move the preceding generations, and the next.”  Power, alongside the works Unit/y, and Movement, forms part of the video triptych Revolution, where Prada investigates ideas commonly associated with the concept of ‘revolution.’ Contrasting the connotations these words carry with archetypal and symbolic situations, Prada proposes a revolution that departs from the body, advocating for “the acceptance of ourselves and our circumstances past and present, without pretenses or glories.”","As the daughter of an actor, Amapola Prada recalls frequently attending the theater as a child and noticing that she never saw herself (her body or reality) represented. On the same vein, during her studies in the field of Social Psychology at university, she noticed the lack of inclusion of non-Western subjectivities—mestizos, Indigenous, migrants among them—and their bodies across all the texts and theories she encountered.

Amapola Prada,"In Amapola Prada’s work Movement, we see three spotlit, female bodies lying inert in a darkened room, alongside three dressed, standing figures holding long, wooden spoons. Looking over the static bodies, the standing figures place their spoons in-between the women’s legs and begin moving them in circular, rowing-like motion, like the oars of a boat.   The psycho-sexually charged nature of Movement is illustrative of Prada’s dream-like works, which often relate to the subconscious and other internal processes with which we express desires, tensions, and latent emotions. For Prada, our bodies are receptacles and hence the memories they carry, both symbolically and physically, are critical sources of information. In the case of Movement, the female body is portrayed as motionless and passive: akin to the wooden spoons, used as yet another inanimate tool.  Movement, alongside the works Unit/y and Power, forms part of the video triptych Revolution, where Prada investigates ideas commonly associated with the concept of ‘revolution.’ Contrasting the connotations these words carry with archetypal and symbolic situations, Prada proposes a revolution that departs from the body, advocating for “the acceptance of ourselves and our circumstances past and present, without pretenses or glories.”","As the daughter of an actor, Amapola Prada recalls frequently attending the theater as a child and noticing that she never saw herself (her body or reality) represented.

Miguel Angel Ríos,,"Miguel Angel Ríos studied at the Academy of Fine Arts in Buenos Aires before moving to New York in the 1970’s to escape the military dictatorship in Argentina. He subsequently relocated to Mexico and now divides his time between New York and Mexico City. In his work, Ríos pairs a rigorous conceptual approach with a meticulously constructed, handmade aesthetic. Since the 1970’s, he has made work about the concept of the Latin American, using this idea as both an artistic strategy and a political problem. Over the past two decades, Ríos has delved into the medium of video to create symbolic narratives about human experience, violence, and mortality. His videos of spinning tops–trompos–use the childhood game as a backdrop for a meditation on the transience of life, and the mechanics of power.",The Ghost of Modernity Lixiviado,Americas,[],"['modernity.n.01', 'symbolism.n.01', 'third_world.n.01', 'debris.n.01', 'history.n.01', 'political_orientation.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/miguel_angel_rios_the_ghost_of_modernity.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/miguel_angel_rios_the_ghost_of_modernity-300x200.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/the-ghost-of-modernity-lixiviado/,"['Politics/4.533333333333334', 'Society/3.7416666666666667', 'Material_Physical/3.3840909090909093']","['Politics', 'Society', 'Material_Physical']",11.65909090909091,"['Politics/4.533333333333334', 'Economy/1.8083333333333333', 'Time/1.709090909090909']","['Politics', 'Economy', 'Time']",8.050757575757576,[],[],0.0,[],[],0.0,,

Prinz Gholam,"Ein Ding Mehr, or ‘one more thing,’ is part of a long-term collaborative performance series by artists Wolfgang Prinz and Michel Gholam, which consist of the pair embodying an array of material through holding various poses for extended periods of time. As the artists perform each gesture, we see them gaze on the preparatory drawings, which act as an instructional score of sorts. The drawing itself, besides featuring carefully drawn sketches of each position, also contains a list of the source material that inspired them: a scene from Pier Paolo Pasolini’s film, Salo, Eugène Delacroix’s Pietà, and a reference to a monument by Auguste Rodin among others. The performance takes place in what appears to be a local gymnasium or basketball court where the couple is filmed and photographed. Described by the artists as ‘visual scenographies,’ their poses in Ein Ding Mehr oscillate between a striking intimacy, complicity and eroticism to the solitary, challenging and even humorous.","Prinz Gholam is a Berlin-based artist duo consisting of Wolfgang Prinz and Michel Gholam.  For nearly a decade, the duo have developed a performative practice that, through a series of choreographed sequences, aims at embodying a range of source material—from ancient paintings, sculptures to contemporary art, film and images from the media. Reminiscent of Gilbert and George’s living sculptures, the long-term collaboration revolves around a corporeal interpretation of the world around us: their various gestures and poses act as a form of mapping through the body of the array of information they internalize. Often performed in historically loaded venues, like a graveyard or an archaeological site, their work speaks of the information we carry in our bodies and how we experience and negotiate the world through images the mind already contains. In addition to their performances, the duo often use drawings to sketch the poses that they reenact. These preparatory studies, while referencing pictorial tradition, also play a role in their investigation: a negotiation between references, and the physical and pictorial self.",Ein Ding Mehr,Europe,"['airs.n.01', 'artist.n.01', 'performance.n.01', 'material.n.01', 'mark.n.01', 'film.v.01', 'pull.v.01', 'kind.n.01', 'pair.n.01', 'memorial.n.03', 'position.n.01', 'local.a.01', 'time_period.n.01', 'gesture.n.01', 'beginning.n.04', 'mention.n.01', 'drawing.n.01', 'ocular.a.02', 'scene.n.01', 'movie.n.01', 'time.n.01', 'series.n.01']","['body.n.01', 'history.n.01', 'familiarity.n.03', 'performance.n.01', 'couple.n.01', 'internal.a.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Image-15site.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Image-15site-300x240.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/ein-ding-mehr/,"['Material_Physical/10.393706293706293', 'Society/2.769230769230769', 'Cultural/1.8571428571428572']","['Material_Physical', 'Society', 'Cultural']",15.020079920079919,"['Space/6.346153846153846', 'Arts/1.8571428571428572', 'Community/1.7692307692307692']","['Space', 'Arts', 'Community']",9.97252747252747,"['Cultural/15.362814086498302', 'Material_Physical/12.488786213786213', 'Society/10.753516074568708']","['Cultural', 'Material_Physical', 'Society']",38.605116374853225,"['Arts/7.883516483516484', 'History/4.247552447552447', 'Land/3.9743589743589745']","['Arts', 'History', 'Land']",16.105427905427906,1.0,0.3333333333333333
Fang Lu,"No World is an action-filled video work filmed inside an abandoned museum in the Songzhuang area outside Beijing. Without using any dialogue, Lu created an artificial scenario where she instructed actors with a list of tasks to gesturally mime scenes from news and journalistic images outside China. Through an intuitive self-trained mimicry, these acts simultaneously became moves in a game as well as a daily routine. No World points to the changing roles of the camera from a device originally invented to memorialize a moment to a tool that situationally creates an event. The performance of violence, conflicts and human relationships in the confined space blurs the boundary between the gallery and everyday life, between staged performance and documentary footage. The work is also a metaphor for a desire in today’s youth to go beyond their controlled, mediated environment and perform chaos in order to heighten their existential awareness.","Lu Fang grew up in a family of Chinese ink painters. Reacting to her upbringing upon exposure to video art, Lu decided to pursue art education in the United States in graphic design and new genres. Fang’s practice consists of video works that explore the way media and performance impact love and human relationships in desolate, insular environments such as deserts or abandoned museums. She often creates site-specific situations where she directs her actors to perform certain tasks or speak on a given theme, paying particular attention to female voice and subjectivity. Furthermore, the staging of her camera work zooms in on the way contemporary media dictate narrative creation that shifts incessantly between the domestic and the exotic, quotidian and supernatural.",No World,Asia,"['performance.n.01', 'everyday.s.01 life.n.01', 'dialogue.n.01', 'perform.v.01', 'actor.n.01', 'tool.n.01', 'documentary.a.01', 'china.n.01', 'footage.n.01', 'desire.n.01', 'daily.s.01', 'game.n.01', 'metaphor.n.01', 'violence.n.01', 'museum.n.01', 'environment.n.01', 'everyday.s.01', 'event.n.01', 'function.n.03', 'moment.n.01', 'relationship.n.01', 'undertaking.n.01', 'camera.n.01', 'human.a.01', 'scene.n.01']","['apery.n.01', 'everyday.s.01', 'news.n.01', 'conflict.n.01', 'violence.n.01', 'memorialize.v.01', 'reenact.v.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/IMG_Fang-Lu-No-World-Photo-Series-02-2014-Photography-inkjet-Innova-Ultra-Smooth-Gloss-Paper-120x80cm-edition-of-1_8_WEB.png,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/IMG_Fang-Lu-No-World-Photo-Series-02-2014-Photography-inkjet-Innova-Ultra-Smooth-Gloss-Paper-120x80cm-edition-of-1_8_WEB-300x200.png,https://kadist.org/work/no-world/,"['Politics/6.241176470588235', 'Society/6.188254030709274', 'Cultural/3.1956043956043954']","['Politics', 'Society', 'Cultural']",15.625034896901905,"['Violence/2.8745098039215686', 'Power/2.7333333333333334', 'Activism/2.574509803921569']","['Violence', 'Power', 'Activism']",8.18235294117647,"['Society/21.404937872584938', 'Individual_Personal/20.66108628213892', 'Cultural/15.252747252747255']","['Society', 'Individual_Personal', 'Cultural']",57.31877140747112,"['Emotion/12.381618381618384', 'Land/5.784718205770837', 'Economy/4.955672268907563']","['Emotion', 'Land', 'Economy']",23.122008856296784,0.6666666666666666,0.0
Taloi Havini,"Following her family’s political exile to Australia in 1990, Havini began to document her journey’s home to the north of Buka Island, in the Autonomous Region of Bougainville. Reflecting on the still visible aftermath of conflict and changing economic factors, Havini creates traditional beroana or shell money from extracted earth materials only found on Solomon islands like Bougainville. Havini’s whirling assemblage of ceramic discs emulate the strings of shell money (still valid around the Pacific as system of payments) to examine the economic changes that occurred in her homeland.  Additionally, the beroana are stored in marae tsuhana, sacred storage vessels, suspended high in secret keeping places. The freely suspended, copious lengths of beroana that Havini has created resonate with the Indigenous Bougainvillean conceptions of land and water spaces as the sacred skin of the people. She invites the viewer to access the sacred space enveloping and protecting Indigenous knowledges in the form of the beroana. In so doing, Havini alludes to unbridled possibility in the years to come for Bougainville, and for all Indigenous peoples whose cultural practices are arrested by aggressive mining activities on their sacred skin/land.","From the Nakas clan, Hakö people, interdisciplinary artist Taloi Havini was raised in Arawa, Autonomous Region of Bougainville. Working with ceramics, photography, print, video and mixed media installation, Havini’s considered approach to art-­making responds to the tensions and aftermath of the German plantations, Australian colonial mining pressures, and the deadly Bougainville conflict around Indigenous land rights and independence of the 1990s.

Chto Delat,"In this film is the story of two neighboring yet philosophically opposing nations: Russia and Norway. Taken through a love-story of the main character Tanja and her newfound Norwegian husband, the film challenges cultural and social norms of both places through the format of a musical. Dealing with issues of individual in society, family and moral values, Chto Delat entices the audience to consider the nuances of these two contexts.","Chto Delat (“What is to be done?”) was founded in 2003 and consists of a group of artists, critics, philosophers, and writers from Petersburg, Moscow, and Nizhny Novgorod.

Mariana Castillo Deball,"Mariana Castillo Deball’s set of kill hole plates are part of a larger body of work problematizing archeological narratives, and drawing attention to the conservation process and its role in recreating an imagined object. They are playful and exaggerated representations of “kill hole pottery” — ceramic dishes in the Mimbres tradition with distinct circular holes located in the center of the pots. Although very little is known about the Mimbres culture’s specific beliefs, they are loosely understood to have terminated the object symbolically in preparation for funerary use. (A common belief is that kill holes served as a conduit to a spiritual world.) When these ceramics were first discovered, however, there was no scholarly precedent to explain the kill holes or differentiate them from the more common broken sherds of most ancient ceramics, so as a result hundreds of these pots were mistakenly repaired. It wasn’t until more kill hole ceramics were unearthed, and sufficient information was collected, that kill holes were understood as intentional absences, punched into the ceramics as a significant act of negation. Deball’s foregrounding of these pots in her recent project was meant to heighten the kind of leaps made around found artifacts through imagined realities, signaling the anxiety of Modernity—the irretrievable loss of information— and highlight the important work of responsibly decoding the gaps of information.","The practice of Mariana Castillo Deball (b. Mexico City, 1975) is centered on intensive research. In weaving together perceived facts and legends, the artist deconstructs how we understand tradition, liberating content from imposed ideological legacies. Mariana Castillo Deball’s collaborative research—in particular in the domain of science, geology, archaeology and literature—is manifested and synthesized into her multimodal sculptural practice. The archive is a significant aspect of the artist’s practice, whereby the research conducted in the creation of her sculptures is culminated, catalogued and preserved. Deball is not only interested in traces of the past, her multidisciplinary approach allows her to study the different ways in which a historical object can be read today.",Mimbres pottery kill hole sequence,Americas,"['hole.n.01', 'common.a.01', 'artifact.n.01', 'object.n.01', 'loss.n.01', 'playful.a.01', 'ancient.s.01', 'religious.s.01', 'locate.v.01', 'specific.a.01', 'attention.n.01', 'set.n.01', 'tradition.n.01', 'center.n.01', 'function.n.03', 'consequence.n.01', 'representation.n.01', 'world.n.03', 'undertaking.n.01', 'procedure.n.01', 'culture.n.01', 'body.n.01', 'narrative.n.01']","['archeology.n.01', 'tradition.n.01', 'ceramics.n.01', 'artifact.n.01', 'loss.n.01', 'decode.v.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/KAF-2017-RECTR-003-WEB.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/KAF-2017-RECTR-003-WEB-300x200.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/mimbres-pottery-kill/,"['Cultural/31.125461775926176', 'Individual_Personal/11.728205128205133', 'Society/7.011655011655011']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Society']",49.86532191578632,"['Arts/12.568216097627863', 'Mind/5.574358974358974', 'Culture/4.990842490842492']","['Arts', 'Mind', 'Culture']",23.13341756282933,"['Cultural/42.917815517815505', 'Individual_Personal/33.80401002506267', 'Material_Physical/22.135764235764245']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Material_Physical']",98.85758977864242,"['Culture/12.872527472527475', 'Mind/12.098168498168498', 'Media/9.803296703296702']","['Culture', 'Mind', 'Media']",34.77399267399267,0.6666666666666666,0.6666666666666666

Arseniy Zhilyaev,"This work was conceived by Zhilyaev as part of the M.I.R.: Polite Guests from the Future exhibition. This iteration of the imagined Museum of Russian History (M.I.R.) is seen from a distant future standpoint. The Russian word ‘mir’ means both peace as well as ‘the world’, and is also the name of the first space station to ever orbit earth. In this Museum’s collection of histories and artifacts which depict the rise and eventual dominance of Russian Cosmic Federation over the charted Cosmos, central is this signature uniform of the cosmic militia. Fashioned in stellar camouflage and armed with a translucent replica of the infamous Kalashnikov rifle, this ensemble finds its roots in the ‘polite politics’ of Russia in the twenty first century.  Arseny Zhilyaev is arguably one of the most influential contemporary Russian Artists of his generation. For Zhilyaev, his medium of choice is the exhibition itself. His practice is deeply rooted in the study of presentation and display of artworks, histories and social processes. His multi-faceted installations combine historical fact with fiction in imagining new possibilities and futures. Inspired by Soviet and Marxist Museology, Zhilyaev often turns Russian Cosmism and its philosophies of the universal museum.","Arseniy Zhilyaev (born 1984 in Voronezh, Russia) is an artist, writer and political activist who lives and works in Moscow and Voronezh.

Jason Fulford,,"Photography and book publishing are inextricable in the work of Jason Fulford. As co-publisher of the long-running J&L books (with Leanne Shapton) and the maker of six monographs collecting and sequencing his photography, the craft and design of bookmaking and a keen attention to the visual associations between  images is in the foreground of his practice. But in the not too distant background, storytelling and performance  play supporting roles, both in concocting events as stages for his photographic work, weaving mystic fictions around his book projects, or as a lark, in one of many informal collaborations with his partner Tamara Shopsin. As a photographer, his images are informed more by discovery than invention, as Fulford is a unquenchable seeker who travels to distant corners of the globe.

Tuan Andrew Nguyen,"This work presents the image of an immolated monk engraved on a baseball bat. The flames surround him eroding the extremity of the bat. The delicate sculpture refers to the sacrifice of the Buddhist monk, Thich Quang Duc, who immolated himself on June 16th 1963, in reaction to the discrimination and the repressive politics of the Diem Catholic regime (regime installed by the Americans) towards the Buddhists. Ironically a memorial was built where the sacrifice took place in Hô Chi Minh-City, despite the fact that under Communism, religion was incompatible with the desire to transform social class. The artwork recalls the shape of the monument; a monument to a monument.  By acknowledging this historical action on a famous national site, one can witness the Vietnamese communist government sympathizing somehow with the victims of the American ‘puppet’ Diem, despite its security policy which guaranteed most of the time an equally repressive behavior.  The representation of this act on a sports accessory, which is supposed to symbolize America and its different social classes, is a way to recall that this popular game reveals social and political behavior. Baseball is considered like a national sport in the United States and Louisville Slugger is one of the most famous brands in the history of baseball. In some ways, it could be considered as a sacrilege to carve such a symbolic national item, that represents power but also violence.  The social symbol carried by baseball and the hypocritical act of building a memorial monument in tribute to this monk, both come from different contexts but are, however, used in favor of political contingency. Religion and sport are social occasions for community gatherings, but may also provoke conflict and violence.","Tuan Andrew Nguyen is an artist and filmmaker, one of the three founders of The Propeller Group created in 2006.

Clément Rodzielski,,"Like many artists of his generation, Clément Rodzielski (born in 1979 in Albi, France) is a well-informed onlooker who works with existing images in order to reveal their mechanisms of construction and circulation. But he concentrates in particular on images which are under our eyes but not seen any longer (motifs found on internet, murals in the urban settings) or don’t circulate (retro cinema posters). Based on these images, he isolates motifs or signs, multiplies different supports and gestures in order to reveal their  materiality (wallpainting, collage, cut-outs, photocopies, stencil, spray paint…) and reframe them so they can be seen better. Making abstract images and de-contextualizing them enables better attention on their pictoriality.  Repeating the same operations in order to exhaust any possibilities of a gesture, Rodzielski’s practice involves numerous series.

Public Movement,"Falling Wall is choreography consisting of a wall, three performers wearing uniforms, and a short ritual. The performers stand aligned in front of the wall, which suddenly falls, menacingly, in the direction of the viewers. The synchronicity of collapse echoes the possibility of transgressing borders such as state frontiers, or even the museum wall. While the highly orchestrated movements of the performers may suggest a state funeral or memorial, the destruction becomes part of the act of commemoration, contradicting the fixed form of monuments and history. Falling Wall disturbs the established order by introducing feelings of doubt and crisis.  The performative research group Public Movement explores the creation of national, social, and political identities through public choreographies. By reenacting commemorative ceremonies, formal exercises from the youth scouts, or emergency procedures, the troupe examines the social choreography of public spaces. They study and reproduce the codes and symbols of what constitutes a nation-state, engaging audiences to take a position within the geopolitics of space. Public Movement was founded in December 2006 by Omer Krieger and Dana Yahalomi, its director since 2011.  The first activation of Falling Wall took place at the Tel Aviv Museum of Art as part of Public Movement’s exhibition National Collection, curated by Ruti Direktor.","The performative research group Public Movement explores the creation of national, social, and political identities through public choreographies.

Gabriel Pericas,"“Efficiency & Abyss 1” is part of a series of photographs of stacked chairs in an auditorium. The design of this chair makes stacking easy and rational. At the same time, this stack produces an optical effect that creates a shape resembling a tunnel or a subterranean passage. The fantastic logic of these abysses is opposed to the pragmatic nature of design. In “Efficiency & Abyss 1” the artist takes a medium employed for documentation and manipulates perspective through the angle he takes the photo. In doing so, Pericàs shows that perspective can be manipulated not only through computer editing but also through manipulated standpoints.","Gabriel Pericàs (b. 1988, Palma de Mallorca, Spain) is interested in developing an ironic view of modernity and its many forms through manipulating design processes. Referencing the work of Duchamp, Richter and Baldessari, Pericàs writes texts that are staged into performances, in which certain of his already existing art pieces are actors. The artist is interested in situating the viewer in a space that is built between narration and formalism employing a variety of digressions and slips to question methods of communication.

Olivia Erlanger,"Sideways Time by Olivia Erlanger is the result of the artist’s interest in networks, seen and unseen, financial and ecological, the collapse of which has resulted in the fracturing of a middle class American identity. Consumption and the construction of value are a frequent concern of her sculptures that explore the structural friction between a public and private. Erlanger looks to the architecture that connects these systems for inspiration and in this sense, the language of scaffoldings, foundations and facades that percolate throughout her work. As the artist has stated: “Anything that can be built simultaneously holds the potential to fall.”  The filing cabinet is a romantic artifact from a pre-cloud based society, designed to give order to personal and impersonal information as well as receipts or small ephemera that document diurnal shifts in value, stacking this information vertically and horizontally giving time a spatial dimension or body. Filled with bentonite clay, a material known for its purifying quality, the cabinets have sheets of porcelain newspapers on the top and off to the side. Sections are cut out, seemingly blown away, as if the contents imploded, revealing the architectural system which failed to organize and contain it. A red light glows inside, subtly adjusting in intensity according to a live stream of data on oil prices. The information regarding this ever shifting commodity seeps out, escaping the confines of the cabinet’s form.","Olivia Erlanger is a New York based artist that works between sculpture and conceptual art.

Bárbara Wagner & Benjamin de Burca,"Originally commissioned for the 32nd Sao Paulo Biennial, the film Estás vendo coisas (You are seeing things) depicts the subculture of Brega music, a fusion of American Hip Hop, Brazilian techno and Caribbean reggaeton that emerged in North Eastern Brazil over the last decade. Part anthropological documentary and part musical the film speaks about the realities of Brazil with its enormous social and economic tensions.","Bárbara Wagner and Benjamin de Burca investigate how inherited aesthetic judgements differ across social classes in developing economies. Their collaborative practice operates between documentary and art, making use of familiar narrative forms in order to ask fundamental questions related to the actual social and political value of art, who it is made for and why. Creating series of photographs, videos, collage and installations they collect accepted forms of visual cultural production and bring to an equal level of presentation diverse and contradictory elements of reality in order to destabilize embedded hierarchies, evincing questions of taste, tradition, race, class, belonging and status not immediately visible.",Estás vendo coisas,Americas,"['documentary.n.01', 'movie.n.01', 'music.n.01', 'tension.n.01', 'economic.a.01', 'american.a.01', 'world.n.03', 'social.a.01']","['subculture.n.01', 'music.n.01', 'class.n.03', 'disparity.n.01', 'fusion.n.01', 'globalization.n.01', 'third_world.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_BWB00001_Estas-Vendo-Coisas_still_DDH1_WEB.png,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_BWB00001_Estas-Vendo-Coisas_still_DDH1_WEB-300x168.png,https://kadist.org/work/estas-vendo-coisas/,"['Society/5.251515151515151', 'Politics/4.092307692307692', 'Cultural/2.6025641025641026']","['Society', 'Politics', 'Cultural']",11.946386946386944,"['Economy/1.9090909090909092', 'Community/1.709090909090909', 'Inequality/1.6923076923076925']","['Economy', 'Community', 'Inequality']",5.310489510489511,"['Cultural/14.219309775192132', 'Individual_Personal/2.3956043956043955', 'Society/1.8333333333333335']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Society']",18.44824750412986,"['Media/5.744067370537959', 'Arts/5.398319327731093', 'Culture/3.076923076923077']","['Media', 'Arts', 'Culture']",14.219309775192128,0.6666666666666666,0.0
Ken Okiishi,"Ken Okiishi’s work Being and/or Time consists of every image taken with Okiishi’s iPhone over the period of three years in his hometown of New York. Flickering in chronological order at 24 images per second with 25,000 images in total. A visual diary of the digital age it simultaneously stages the city itself as a time-­image continuously remade by its own resident-­users. The work continues Okiishi’s exploration of zones of temporality within the context he lives in by including images from Manhattan, Queens, Brooklyn and the Bronx each with their own temporalities. The title of the work is a reference to a book by controversial German philosopher Martin Heidegger in which he seeks to analyse the concept of Being in relation to the notion of Time. Being and Time have profoundly influenced twentieth century philosophy, particularly existentialism.","Ken Okiishi’s practice explores subjects such as the psychogeography of cities, memory formation, and global data streams.

Olive Martin & Patrick Bernier,"The Mohawk, the emblematic Frontier river in the period of American colonisation, is here a cable of data transmission, and the 7 Sultans Casino is a virtual destination, one of the three hundred online casinos hosted by the servers located in Kahnawake, a small native american indian reserve to the south of Montreal. Incorporating poker, challenges to the law, a struggle for the control of a new territory where the stakes are high, our film ‘La Nouvelle Kahnawake’, between fiction and documentary, pushes these analogies with the Western to explore both our relationship to the figure of the ‘Indian’ and the confusion of our perception of space that new information technology has brought about. As the artists state:  “We are neither anthropologists nor journalists. We didn’t want to make a documentary on the Mohawks; we’ll leave that to the Mohawks themselves who haven’t waited for us to develop operational systems for their cinematic and audiovisual productions. Describing our last film, Manmuswak, we say that it is at once a fiction about the life of ‘invisible’ immigrants and a documentary about our way of perceiving them: this is the viewpoint that we would like to keep in this new film. If this is a documentary then the subject is us. We are documenting ourselves, in an ‘extrospective’ rather than introspective way. We are a multitude of things: a man and a woman, a heterosexual couple, the mother and the father of a little girl; we are the descendants of the working class and of the bourgeoisie, of white colonialists and black slaves, we are consumers, creators of cultural wealth, polluters, militants, internet users; we are French, we are European, we are westerners… So, in some respects we are similar to those who appear in the film, to the Mohawks, to the Quebecois, and to the gamblers, and we differ in others.  Our film is a way of posing ourselves certain questions. In what way does this story interest us? That is, in what way does it involve us and concern us? In what way can it inform us? That is to say, teach us about ourselves and our place in the world process of globalisation.”","Patrick Bernier and Olive Martin (born in 1971 and 1972) have collaborated for several years and developed a multidisciplinary work combining writing, film, photography and performance.

Daria Martin,"Soft Materials is a curious, touching but also disturbing sequence of confrontations between two people: a man and a woman, and machines. Shot in the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory at the University of Zurich, the humans and the machines mirror each other’s actions. It is unclear which party takes the lead. Do the humans mimic the machines or are the machines following the humans? Each of the protagonists, whether human or mechanical, are vulnerable and naked –the humans stripped of clothing and the machines lacking protective covering. Like the celebrated film “Ballet Mechanique” by Leger, Martin’s film suggests the erotics of the mechanised world. The film evokes a history of modernist aspiration for utopia where man and machine would become bedfellows or at least entirely complimentary. The machines learn to think and act like humans echoing their appearance and actions. The work references both American body performance art of the 1960s and 1970s as well as Robert Morris’s work “Neoclassic” in which a naked dancer was filmed interacting with his sculptures at the Tate Gallery in 1971 in a series of peaceful, trancelike actions.","A number of Daria Martin’s films explore the relationship between humans and machines and make reference to modernist art, whether through the work of the Bauhuas (Schlemmer), Surrealism (Giacometti’s Palace at 4 AM) or American art of the 1960s and 1970s. Her films involve performance and many are shown as 16mm projections – assembling memories, reveries, scholarly research, and imported citations drawn from a wide range of sources including early twentieth century painting, sculpture, fashion, stage, and dance productions. “I came to the medium of film because of its open potential,” writes Daria Martin, “Its invitation to travel through time and space within an imagined world.” The artist values the contradictions of the medium of film, in particular the tension between the private fantasy it stimulates and the public physicality on which it depends.

Benoît Maire,"The piece consists of sculpture of 10 elements, among them: a globe, a picture of a gorilla, a chair, scrabble letters, 3 glasses of black ink, a book whose title is illuminated by the beam of a 8mm projector, a pair of boots, etc. The display is a collection of selected objects chosen in response to the reading of a text by Alain Badiou (the first chapter of the seminar “Le réel est l’impasse de la formalisation; la formalisation est le lieu de passe en force du réel” from February 4, 1975). The elements are a visual way to question the transposition of an idea into reality. The challenge of the work lies in translating the speech of an artistic image, which itself generates speech. “For me the display of objects, is to provide support for a thought experiment, of a philosophy that “would return to the things themselves.”  Here I associate these “things themselves” to concrete objects.” In this sense, the work may be considered “complete” on the day in which the philosopher will use this display as a possible image for his thought. This network of indices awaits new meanings and interpretations. Emblematic of the artist, this work is rhizomatic. Some elements of this display have indeed contributed to other works made thereafter. For example, the image of gorilla refers to a work entitled Purpose Monkey (2007), while the book Le Bonheur de Vivre presented as part of the display was the subject of a video shown at the Biennale in Lyon in 2007.","From references to philosophical readings, Benoît Maire makes performances, organizes discussions, sculptures, assemblages of objects in space, paintings and videos. More than just a link between philosophy and art, his work creates a network of correlations and questions between the two disciplines, addressing the realization of an idea. How does one go from textual representation to a system of representation specific to visual arts? “Sometimes a picture is better to pose a problem,” says the artist, “this is not about appropriating references, but to use them as an order of representation, like traces, memories, and spectra to reactivate.” In Maire’s work, arises the question of the “making” of an idea so that it becomes an object of reality, and in this case a work of art.Benoit Maire was born in 1978 in Pessac, France.

Tala Madani,"Madani works on a small scale and a large scale. This work is from a series of small paintings called Dazzle Men that take as their starting point the Dazzle patterns used by artists to camouflage ships during the First World War. Dazzle camouflage was designed to confuse the aim of U boat commanders. Its unstable, brightly coloured distortions were closely allied to modernist painting and indeed formed the subject of a memorable series of woodcuts and a major painting by the British Vorticisit Edward Wadsworth. In Madani’s painting Middle Eastern looking men take as their model an image of a dazzleship for the purpose of self-disguise. Applying paint to their bodies they adopt the strategy of maquillage that is essentially feminising. Madani thereby satirises the overly masculine society these men inhabit. While some have applied only small amounts highlighting their breasts, others have applied stripes recalling prison outfits. These men are trapped in their own world, prisoners of the stereotyping that grows out of education, religion and culture. In conversation with Doug McClemont Madani stated: ‘I’m interested in the behaviour of the masses.  Creating icons, figures and then having later on to destroy. The creation of icons, which then inevitably are destroyed because the icon becomes corrupt, or something. To me, that’s very religious behaviour, needing to put something up on a pedestal. And the mass behavioral tendency of later on of being almost inevitably oppressed by it somehow. Having to bring it down. In a way painting is poking fun at religious behaviour. The masses can behave ridiculously in many circumstances.’","Madani’s paintings have a caricatural quality that suggest a satirical intention. She only paints images of men. This came about initially because she ‘didn’t want to deal with the question of the veil, and I didn’t particularly want to sexualise the figures with perked up breasts, so ultimately I was left with men.’ Since making that statement she has expressed an interest in depicting spaces ‘designated for men only’.  Madani’s work can be interpreted as a comment on an overbearingly patriarchal society, whether in Iran or indeed any Western country. Her cartoony paintings expose ethnic and gender stereotypes with a lightness of touch that belies their punch. The painterly nature of Madani’s approach has led her to make films composed of freeze frame shots of paintings that she changes from shot to shot. Born in 1981, Tala Madani is a young Iranian artist who has lived outside Iran since the age of 14.

Julius Koller,"Anti-Happening refers to Koller’s 1965 manifesto, ‘Anti-Happening (System of Subjective Objectivity)’. In opposition to the notion of a ‘happening’ as a way of actualising group identity, in his manifesto, Koller stated that his concept of the ‘anti-happening’ aimed at a ‘cultural reshaping of the subject, at awareness, at the surroundings and the real world’ [i]. Unlike happenings, these actions do not involve the staging of psychologically expressive performances.  As the art historian Piotr Petrowski has noted, it is part of ‘an attitude that aims to erase the boundaries between different art tendencies (art and anti-art, modernist and neo-avant-garde painting), between different forms of neo-avant-garde practice (performance, conceptual art, Fluxus) and, above all, between art and life’[ii].  [i] Kathrin Rhomberg and Roman Ondák (eds.), Julius Koller: Univerzálne Futurologické Operácie, Cologne 2003. p.126.    [ii] Piotr Piotrowski, In the Shadow of Yalta: Art and the Avant-Garde in Eastern Europe, 1945–1989, London 2009.","In its stringency, obsession and peculiarity, the oeuvre of Julius Koller is one of the most idiosyncratic and consistent in European art since the 1960s. Yet Koller is not only a seminal figure in the history of the neo- and post-avant-garde; his work has long been a critical inspiration for artists and intellectuals. In the most recent past, Koller’s concepts of the Anti-Happening, the Anti-Picture, the Universal-cultural Futurological Operation (U.F.O.), his actions, objects, texts and the enormous referential archive he built up, have attracted growing interest on the part of a broader art public.  From around 1960, in response to the modernist mainstream in Slovak art, Julius Koller began to develop his aesthetic position of the “antihappening.” His strategy consists in using real objects and everyday life as the predefined program for an aesthetic operation: from 1965, in texts rubberstamped on paper that refer to the context of the “anti-happening,” and then in 1967/1968 in pictures for which Koller used white latex paint instead of oils and which saw the first appearance of the question mark—the symbol of Koller’s brands of naming, or “making known,” that was later to undergo many mutations in various media and states of aggregation. The “invitation cards for an idea”—as Koller called the text works relating to the “anti-happenings”—and the palimpsests and serial arrangements of the “anti-pictures” set themselves apart from the academicism of Modernism in more than just formal terms. Koller foregoes every form of technical mastery. The “anti-pictures” are amateurish in style, ensuring that they fulfill their task, defined by Koller as “engaging rather than arranging.”Julius Koller was born in 1939 in Piestany, Slovakia.

Nicolás Grum,"El gran pacto de Chile (The Great Pact) and La balserita de Puerto Gala (The Raft) were part of the “Museo Futuro”, an exhibition in which the artist presented nine miniature dioramas staging fragments of Chile’s history, from its colonial invasions to the present. Through the episodes he chose to depict, the artist focused on historical narratives, the way the story is told, and the supposed irrefutability of historical facts.  Museo Futuro (“Future Museum”) stands within a tradition of artists who re-read history and offer their interpretation of it through the distopic lens of the museum display. “Future Museum is the vision of a fuzzy present seen from the distance of an impossible place,” says the artist. Playing with the way the mass media have represented certain of these events that compose Chilean history, and how this has engraved collective memory, the artist sets an ambiguous light of these “official” narratives, ranging from natural disasters, the decadence of art, politics, deceit and forgetfulness.  The use of an old fashioned media, miniature maquettes, evokes obsolete museology in an age where realistic images are omnipresent. It questions the format of representation, the museification of the present and the impact these events have on popular culture.","Through a variety of media (video, drawing, sculpture and installations), Nicolás Grum explores with a touch of sarcasm and humor, the dominant discourses coming from different circles of power — politics, history, economy and art — constantly putting into question the idea of authority and “truth”.",La balserita de Puerto Gala (The Raft),Americas,"['museum.n.01', 'future.n.01', 'event.n.01', 'narrative.n.01', 'historical.a.01', 'history.n.01', 'medium.n.01', 'lens.n.01', 'episode.n.01', 'age.n.01', 'mass.n.01', 'represent.v.01', 'picture.v.02', 'distance.n.01', 'display.n.01', 'fragment.n.01', 'format.n.01', 'politics.n.01', 'vision.n.01', 'impact.n.01', 'interpretation.n.01', 'popular.a.01', 'corporate.s.03', 'natural.a.01', 'tradition.n.01']","['history.n.01', 'incontrovertible.s.01', 'fact.n.01', 'colonialism.n.01', 'narrative.n.01', 'fiction.n.01', 'bias.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/nicolas_grum_cpax-11a_web.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/nicolas_grum_cpax-11a_web-199x300.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/balserita-puerto-gala/,"['Cultural/10.48622766122766', 'Society/5.959565580618212', 'Individual_Personal/2.475']","['Cultural', 'Society', 'Individual_Personal']",18.920793241845875,"['Fantasy/7.400757575757576', 'History/1.7777777777777777', 'Colonization/1.7777777777777777']","['Fantasy', 'History', 'Colonization']",10.95631313131313,"['Cultural/29.27773452038159', 'Material_Physical/20.894316794316794', 'Individual_Personal/17.639072039072044']","['Cultural', 'Material_Physical', 'Individual_Personal']",67.81112335377043,"['Time/10.996148296148295', 'Media/8.518288084464555', 'Mind/8.058852258852259']","['Time', 'Media', 'Mind']",27.573288639465108,0.6666666666666666,0.0
Oscar Munoz,"In Ante la imagen (Before the Image, 2009) Muñoz continues to explore the power of a photograph to live up to the memory of a specific person. Since a photograph is fixed, it cannot encapsulate the spirit of someone who is gone. Muñoz etched onto the surface of a mirror an appropriated historical image, a daguerreotype from 1839. The viewer sees themselves as well as the subject, the chemist Robert Cornelius. The image is always changing, decaying, in a metaphor for life.","Óscar Muñoz is regarded as one of Colombia’s most important artists, recognized for creating an outstanding body of work over the past three decades in a country troubled by civil war and drug-related violence. He is also the cofounder of Lugar a Dudas (Room for Doubt), a vital art space for activating critical thinking and providing cultural exchange in Cali, Colombia. He is not formally trained in photography, but likes the medium for its capacity to illustrate the transformations of unstable materials such as charcoal, sugar, coffee, and breath. Muñoz is concerned with presence and absence, forgetting and remembering, and acts of engraving and impression. The physicality of the impression is a metaphor for the moment when a memory becomes fixed in the mind. Produced in the context of Colombia, in a culture of disappearance, his work is a profound metaphor for the human experience of life and death.",Ante la imagen,Americas,"['mirror.n.01', 'spirit.n.01', 'research.v.02', 'image.n.01', 'specific.a.01', 'photograph.n.01', 'metaphor.n.01', 'person.n.01', 'surface.n.01', 'historical.a.01', 'power.n.01', 'memory.n.01', 'subject.n.01', 'spectator.n.01', 'life.n.01']","['decay.n.01', 'death.n.01', 'memory.n.01', 'identity.n.01', 'photography.n.01', 'decay.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/img_oscar_munoz_ante_la_imagen.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/img_oscar_munoz_ante_la_imagen-300x200.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/ante-la-imagen/,"['Individual_Personal/9.193584193584195', 'Cultural/5.9781376518218625', 'Material_Physical/3.5494505494505493']","['Individual_Personal', 'Cultural', 'Material_Physical']",18.72117239485661,"['Identity/4.797979797979798', 'Mind/2.5384615384615383', 'Culture/2.307692307692308']","['Identity', 'Mind', 'Culture']",9.644133644133644,"['Cultural/24.31527149321268', 'Individual_Personal/14.004451104451105', 'Material_Physical/9.464468864468865']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Material_Physical']",47.78419146213265,"['Materiality/5.9501831501831495', 'Mind/4.934065934065934', 'Culture/4.615384615384616']","['Materiality', 'Mind', 'Culture']",15.499633699633701,1.0,0.6666666666666666
Park McArthur,"McArthur is not solely concerned with the limitations of the disabled, however, but sees the structures built (and missing) around disability access as part of a larger system of social and economic injustices. In her installation work Private Signs, McArthur appropriates shapes, colors, and geometries from familiar types of signage. Some of these signs—like a blue rectangle inside a green-bounded white box—are recognizable as handicapped access parking signs, while others are a bit more obscure in their composition. All of the signs in McArthur’s wall-sized installation take on the look of a minimalist, geometric painting, however, with the words, symbols, and directions stripped away to leave simplified arrangements.","American artist Park McArthur creates sculptures, sound, video, wall-based works, and writing that all grow out of her experience of everyday life. Responding to and working with the daily, McArthur uses her artistic practice as a way to critique and interrogate systems and conditions. Wheelchair-bound due to a form of muscular dystrophy, McArthur’s work, at times, deals with methods and limitation of access that the artist and others with disabilities face. Her New York gallery exhibition, Ramps (2014), consisted of portable wheelchair ramps borrowed from art spaces and institutions around the city. Placed in the gallery, directly on the floor, these portable ramps took on the look of Arte Povera sculptures, while also highlighting an issue important to the artist.

Pascual Sisto,"In the video No Not Nothing Never, a group of 23 domestic fans arranged in a mountainous desert landscape, move in perfect synchrony. Although when placed in this arid geography, the fans become evocative of wind turbines that generate electricity, the fans used by Pascual Sisto consume energy in a futile attempt to alleviate the dry heat. The familiar humming of the fans is eclipsed by the sounds of the strong desert winds that pass by as the fans turn.  No Not Nothing Never reflects the artist’s fascination of the divide between natural and artificial, which is a key concern across his oeuvre. As per many of his works, Sisto here disrupts the mundane, removing a common household object from its usual context and purpose in order to create a space of inquiry.","Artist and filmmaker Pascual Sisto is known for creating works that reimagine the mundane as captivating alternate realities. Although he works across media (including video, film, sculpture and installation), most recently, Sisto has produced a series of films and video works that use visual effects, animation, and other forms of digital interventions as a means to explore the metaphysical dimension of the virtual world. Often by repurposing information gathered from multiple sources—such as footage from the internet, his own video archive, computer animation, and even data mined by algorithms—Sisto creates synthetic, new environments that exist in parallel to ‘real’ space, or what we understand as such. These alternate spaces allow him to explore the digital realm an expression of our consciousness as well as how we physically and emotionally relate to technology and forms of artificial intelligence. Although the subjects, objects and landscapes we see across his work are recognisable—like a group of domestic fans blowing wind into the desert, or digitally rendered objects like a can of paint, a watch, or a hand grenade floating in virtual space—Sisto strips them of their ordinary purpose, dislocating order and function to create what he describes as ‘moments of transition.’  From the physical to the abstracted, Sisto shows us liminal space, a sort of limbo between the real and the virtual; between presence and representation; between the imagined and the concrete.",No Not Nothing Never,Americas,"['strong.a.01', 'purpose.n.01', 'familiar.a.01', 'common.a.01', 'natural.a.01', 'sound.n.01', 'attempt.n.01', 'cardinal.s.01', 'family.n.01', 'context.n.01', 'make.v.03', 'landscape.n.01', 'object.n.01', 'space.n.01', 'video.n.01']","['desert.n.01', 'technology.n.01', 'fan.n.01', 'windmill.n.02', 'heat.n.01', 'futile.s.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/pascual_sisto_no_not_nothing_never_web.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/pascual_sisto_no_not_nothing_never_web-300x169.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/no-not-nothing/,"['Cultural/12.534593837535013', 'Material_Physical/3.2750000000000004', 'Society/1.6470588235294117']","['Cultural', 'Material_Physical', 'Society']",17.456652661064425,"['Technology/8.44439775910364', 'Arts/2.5124183006535947', 'Land/2.475']","['Technology', 'Arts', 'Land']",13.431816059757235,"['Cultural/9.52967032967033', 'Society/8.403174603174604', 'Individual_Personal/8.355311355311354']","['Cultural', 'Society', 'Individual_Personal']",26.288156288156287,"['Culture/3.964835164835165', 'Spirituality/3.257142857142857', 'Land/2.6']","['Culture', 'Spirituality', 'Land']",9.821978021978023,0.6666666666666666,0.3333333333333333
Pascual Sisto,"All Watched Over by Machines of Loving Grace takes its title from a 1967 poem by American writer Richard Brautigan, which describes a utopian future where computers are in harmony with and protective of mankind and nature, performing all the necessary work while we retreat back towards nature. In Sisto’s work, a computer generated voice recites Brautigan’s poem while a series of digitally rendered 3D objects with a sleek, mirrored finish, float weightlessly across the screen. Sisto’s work also shares its title with the 2011 BBC documentary series by filmmaker Adam Curtis, which has the view that computers have failed in their task of liberating humanity and have instead created a simplified and distorted world around us. In contrast to Sisto’s version where a robotic voice recites the poem in Curtis’ series the voice we hear is Brautigan himself, and the footage—bears in the wild, people in the nude, sunlight piercing through trees—is almost the opposite of Sisto’s synthetic environs. Adding a layer of complexity, the music in Sisto’s work is also generated by a complex computer algorithm developed by David Cope, a musician and scientist who spent over 30 years of his life teaching machines how to write music.  Considering multiple expressions across recent decades, and specifically, through the lenses of Brautigan, Curtis, and even Cope—Sisto’s work is a meditation on our complex relationship with technology and the affective dimension of artificial intelligence.","Artist and filmmaker Pascual Sisto is known for creating works that reimagine the mundane as captivating alternate realities.

Rachel Rose,"In the 2013 video work, Sitting Feeding Sleeping, Rose combines footage taken of zoo animals living in captivity with screen images that flicker and flash before us. In the narration, Rose talks about forms of life that are suspended and simulated—artificial intelligence and cryogenically frozen bodies, zoo animals and counterfeit ecologies. Through this montage of different types of footage and text, Rose poses us between the natural and the artificial, and speaks to the very strange moment of life in a world that is seemingly caught between the two, existing in a hybrid (though not necessarily symbiotic) moment of radical change.","For artist Rachel Rose, the current moment is one of shifting terrain: as technology advances, the world changes beneath and around us, leaving us struggling to keep up.

Robert Zhao Renhui,"Created during Zhao Renhui’s residency at Kadist SF in 2014, Zhao Renhui began observing and cataloguing insects inspired by the scientific impulse towards exhaustive taxonomy of Sacramento-based Dr. Martin Hauser, Senior Insect Biosystematist at the California Department of Food and Agriculture, and longtime acquaintance of the artist. In Villa Dei Fiori, September to November, Zhao Renhui tracked and collected multiple insects within the everyday urban environment, either finding the insects dead or following them around for few days.","Robert Zhao Renhui’s photographic prints question fact-based presentations of conservation and highlight the manner through which documentary, journalistic, or scientific reports sensationalize nature in order to elicit viewer sympathy. Zhao portrays human as figures curious about their natural environment, which is at times mysterious and unpredictable. Through observing human behavior in front of animals rather than that of the animals themselves, Zhao’s critical lens examines various modes of what he calls a “zoological gaze,” the manner through which humans view animals and nature. His works create visual ambiguity so the viewer becomes aware of assumptions made about the way images present facts. Zhao received a Bachelor of Fine Arts in photography at Caberwell College of Arts and a Masters degree at the London College of Communication, where he graduated with distinction.","Villa dei Fiori, September to November",Asia,"['food.n.01', 'california.n.01', 'multiple.a.01', 'inspire.v.01', 'urban.a.01', 'environment.n.01', 'everyday.s.01', 'make.v.03']","['science.n.01', 'nature.n.01', 'environment.n.01', 'representation.n.08', 'animal.n.01', 'ecology.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/image_zhao_renhui_villa_dei_fiori.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/image_zhao_renhui_villa_dei_fiori-300x200.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/villa-dei-fiori/,"['Cultural/16.595059008758703', 'Material_Physical/12.062091125249019', 'Individual_Personal/7.4919342095812675']","['Cultural', 'Material_Physical', 'Individual_Personal']",36.14908434358899,"['Arts/4.906862745098039', 'Technology/4.208333333333333', 'Physics/3.419883040935672']","['Arts', 'Technology', 'Physics']",12.535079119367044,"['Material_Physical/4.335775335775336', 'Society/1.7777777777777777', 'Cultural/1.0']","['Material_Physical', 'Society', 'Cultural']",7.113553113553114,"['Land/2.4126984126984126', 'Urbanization/1.7777777777777777', 'Culture/1.0']","['Land', 'Urbanization', 'Culture']",5.19047619047619,0.6666666666666666,0.0
Rodney McMillian,"In his evocative Landscape Paintings, McMillian uses second-hand bedsheets, sourced from thrift shops, as his starting point. Calling up the unknown intimacies of these objects, McMillian upends their usual orientation, placing them directly on the wall to serve as paintings, rather than covers. Layering over the repurposed textiles with hardware store paint, McMillian transforms the sheets into canvases, creating abstract landscapes on top of the traces of human bodies intact in the fabric. His vibrant red composition from 2013 slips and drips from its edges onto the floor, with figure and ground evoking different scales of representation—the zoomed out, depopulated landscape created by the paint, and the human-scaled intimacy of the bedsheets.","Rodney McMillian works in many modes, creating sculptures, paintings, videos, performances, and installations that speak to the lived experiences of individuals and communities in the United States.

Rodrigo Braga,"Braga’s video work Provisão (2009) opens with a still shot of a clearing in a forest, shoots of grass emerging from a muddy brown patch of seemingly dry and barren earth. As the camera fades to black, the viewer hears the repeated sound of a shovel striking dirt. The camera fades back to the clearing and zooms in on a shirtless man digging up the ground. The hole grows wider and deeper as he digs, becoming an almost crater-like expanse filled knee-deep with ground water. The man emerges from the hole and begins to chop the base of a tree next to the hole, hacking away with deep and repetitive strokes until the tree begins to fell and eventually collapse into the massive cavity beneath. A symbol of life and growth, the tree’s collapse is achieved solely by pushing one’s strength to an absolute limit. He emerges from the hole again and begins to shovel the dirt back in, burying the tree under a seemingly endless and inexhaustible pile of earth until it is fully covered, its branches and leaves submerged. The metaphors here between destruction and nature are difficult to ignore. At once both poetic and unsettling, Provisão offers a cautionary tale about the harmful impacts of human interventions on the environment.","Born in Manaus in the heart of the Amazon rainforest, Brazilian-born artist Rodrigo Braga confronts the natural world head-on. His video and media-based work are centered on these encounters that place him at the focus point of the work, between the human condition and the animal kingdom. Braga’s performative practice reveals itself through photography that deals with his relationship with landscape and animals. For Braga, the body is the medium of which he exposes the limits. Power dynamics, weakness, life, death, struggle, submission, domination and masculinity come to play in his practice of photography, video and installation. He tests his limits with any beast, exposing carnal instincts with a calibrated approach. Braga has exhibited internationally including the 30th São Paulo Bienal, The Imminence of Poetics (São Paulo, 2012); From the Margin to the Edge, Somerset House (London, 2012); Mythologies, Cité Internationale des Arts (Paris, 2011); and Giant by nature, IVAM – Instituto Valenciano de Arte Moderna (Valencia, 2011).",Provisão,Americas,"['hole.n.01', 'tree.n.01', 'land.n.04', 'earth.n.01', 'camera.n.01', 'destruction.n.01', 'water.n.01', 'intervention.n.01', 'impact.n.01', 'poetic.a.01', 'symbol.n.01', 'metaphor.n.01', 'shooting.n.01', 'sound.n.01', 'environment.n.01', 'nature.n.01', 'black.a.01', 'human.a.01', 'spectator.n.01', 'narrative.n.01', 'life.n.01', 'video.n.01']","['symbolism.n.01', 'destruction.n.01', 'life.n.01', 'ecology.n.01', 'nature.n.01', 'exploitation.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/rodrigo_braga_provisao_2009_3.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/rodrigo_braga_provisao_2009_3-300x200.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/provisao/,"['Material_Physical/8.411807800043093', 'Society/7.5255237516107085', 'Individual_Personal/6.501587301587301']","['Material_Physical', 'Society', 'Individual_Personal']",22.438918853241102,"['Materiality/3.235897435897436', 'Environmental/2.7523809523809524', 'Familial/2.4571428571428573']","['Materiality', 'Environmental', 'Familial']",8.445421245421246,"['Material_Physical/14.143304244774836', 'Society/5.925523751610708', 'Individual_Personal/5.7675213675213675']","['Material_Physical', 'Society', 'Individual_Personal']",25.836349363906912,"['Materiality/4.093040293040294', 'Space/3.355672268907563', 'Environmental/2.6754578754578757']","['Materiality', 'Space', 'Environmental']",10.124170437405732,1.0,0.6666666666666666
Saâdane Afif,"In this work, Saâdane Afif quotes André Cadere’s round wooden batons using the copy share and remix principles. Cadere’s sculptures, batons constituted with a mathematical chain of painted wood segments containing one error in the succession of colors, can be presented according to any possible configuration (on the wall, floor, hung or not). In the catalogue documenting the project, Power chords, there is a facsimile (another type of quotation) of one of Cadere’s conferences: “Présentation d’un travail, utilisation d’un travail” (presentation of a work, use of a work). The batons appear in different works by Afif like tools of an essential vocabulary: with nuances of black (Black spirit, 2004), of white (Ghost, 2005), translated into sound (Power chords, 2005) or light (Untitled 1971/2003-B 0230 1004 =30= =22×23=, 2003).  Saâdane Afif questions the generative capacity of error as the title suggests: A few more mistakes. He toys with some of the defining parameters of Cadere’s batons (nuances of grey, presentation as stalactites) in order to disrupt them. The title suggests that the work is in fact a portrait. Gilbert & George are two artists who perform and make photomontages about the concept of a couple. Afif pays homage to them via the minimal index of wooden batons as a reference to their notion of ‘living sculptures’.","Saâdane Afif practices the quote: “I belong to a generation of artists who {…} discuss art as a form of language, with which you play upon, you deform, you transform, without focusing on the object as it was before.” Such strategies of re-appropriation insert themselves inside a context of idea circulation, as a form of remixing and remaking. In the work “Pirates Who’s Who,” tactics of assemblage are recognizable on all levels. The artist makes use of an eccentric shelf by designer Ron Arad, displaying dripping paint on the wall while the shelf itself holds a collection of books on piracy, compiled together by the owner of the work. “Power chords” (2005), perhaps the most ambitious project by the artist to date, is both a work for publication and several exhibitions. The installation depicts automatic electric guitars, playing scores orchestrated by a computer program. The chords are defined by color sequences derived from André Cadere’s wooden segments. Yet with Afif’s displacement, the artist hints to the color and rhythmic sound dimensions vis-à-vis Cadere, inside a genre of synesthesia. In an age of numerical technology, Cadere’s rhythmic system echoes in a particular manner together with the processes of digitization. Afif suggests a principle of encoding the world underlying the real, or rhythmic language before the Tower of Babel. Saâdane Afif was born in 1970 in Vendome, France.

Young-Hae Chang Heavy Industries,"Pacific Limn weaves together three narratives that comment on hyper-capitalism pan-Pacific cities that San Francisco exemplifies. Each of the large works comprise of moving images overlaid with giant text, all synched to a stealthy, up-tempo jazz soundtrack. In The Secret Life of Harumi, a Japanese woman fantasizes escaping her job and living a temporary dream life in San Francisco. Young-Hae Chang Heavy Industries (YHCHI) uses locally sourced virtual products such as Adobe Flash animation and Apple’s Monaco or Menlo typeface to create a whimsical and indirect commentary on the psychology of the working class in an information society within postindustrial imperialism. For two months, YHCHI inhabited the economically polarized South of Market neighborhood, where a variety of socioeconomic realities overlap and coexist, from Facebook employees to the homeless. The Flash animation is influenced by realist cinema and depicts the tediousness in commuting by air and ground combined with the kitsch of an “Asia-town” window display. Overlaid with text-like femslash prose in a semi-coherent style of karaoke lyrics, the sensory cacophony disrupts a viewer’s thoughts and alludes to a desensitized boredom mixed with the desires of the alternative persona of a fictional Japanese woman.","Young-Hae Chang Heavy Industries is a Seoul-based Web art group consisting of Young-hae Chang and Marc Voge formed in 1999. Chang is a Korean artist and translator with a Ph.D in aesthetics from Universite de Paris I, and Marc Voge is an American poet living in Seoul. Their work tends to combine text with jazz to create Flash animation pieces. This combination is a simple technique that shuns interactivity, graphics, photos, illustrations, banners, colors, but at the same time transgresses the boundaries between digital animation, motion graphics, experimental video, i-movies, and e-poetry.",PACIFIC LIMN,Asia,"['animation.n.01', 'san_francisco.n.01', 'japanese.a.01', 'woman.n.01', 'film.n.02', 'market.n.01', 'occupation.n.01', 'fictional.a.01', 'life.n.01', 'display.n.01', 'dream.n.01', 'land.n.04', 'class.n.01', 'desire.n.01', 'south.n.01', 'society.n.01', 'manner.n.01', 'world.n.03', 'city.n.01', 'make.v.03', 'spectator.n.01', 'narrative.n.01']","['fantasy_life.n.01', 'gentrification.n.01', 'desensitization.n.01', 'line.n.05', 'animation.n.05', 'kitsch.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/japan_1_web.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/japan_1_web-300x169.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/pacific-limn/,"['Cultural/13.015452847805792', 'Individual_Personal/3.202614379084967', 'Material_Physical/2.3790849673202614']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Material_Physical']",18.59715219421102,"['Arts/6.131302521008403', 'Language/2.666666666666667', 'Fantasy/2.593954248366013']","['Arts', 'Language', 'Fantasy']",11.391923436041083,"['Cultural/30.548371236606542', 'Individual_Personal/29.90579420579422', 'Society/25.300805936409656']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Society']",85.75497137881042,"['Emotion/13.181618381618385', 'Land/11.20237017884077', 'Media/9.729268117503413']","['Emotion', 'Land', 'Media']",34.11325667796257,0.6666666666666666,0.0
Apichatpong Weerasethakul,"Haunted Houses is a video in which villagers near Weerasethakul’s hometown of Khon Kaen were re-enact scenes from the popular Thai soap opera Tong Prakaisad. By encouraging villagers to play dramatic characters whose fates they had followed intimately, the video comments on the manner in which real experience and fantasy mediate and feed back to each other. Weerasethakul calls this phenomenon ‘medium addiction,’ a term describing a continual Thai fascination with spirits that dwell in a world parallel to everyday life. Critically aware of the mediums of film and video, Weerasetahkul’s works capture the manner through which traditional ways of mediating and perceiving the world is transcoded into new forms through new media. With filmed subjects entering television fantasies as easily as the television characters’ entering the living rooms and families of the viewers, Haunted Houses reflects the multiple other-worlds haunting the contemporary Thai consciousness in light of new communication technologies brought on by modern infrastructures, urban planning, and modern medicine.","Born in Bangkok, Thailand in July 1970, Apichatpong Weerasethakul is an independent filmmaker initially trained in architecture at Khon Kaen University. After receiving a Masters degree in filmmaking from the Art Institute of Chicago in 1997, Weerasethakul commenced a prodigious career in experimental cinema that awarded him the Jury Prize and Palm d’Or at the Cannes International Film Festival for Uncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives in 2010. As evidenced in feature length works such as Blissfully Yours, Tropical Malady, and Syndrome and a Century, Weerasethakul’s films are marked by interplays between organic, natural time and measured cinematic time while drawing from Buddhist narrative structures as well as science fiction themes.",Haunted Houses,Unspecified,"['television.n.01', 'medium.n.01', 'modern.a.01', 'house.n.01', 'fictional_character.n.01', 'manner.n.01', 'video.n.01', 'everyday.s.01 life.n.01', 'phenomenon.n.01', 'life.n.02', 'consciousness.n.01', 'bring.v.01', 'fantasy.n.01', 'multiple.a.01', 'technology.n.01', 'viewing_audience.n.01', 'popular.a.01', 'traditional.a.01', 'urban.a.01', 'real.a.01', 'everyday.s.01', 'family.n.01', 'light.n.01', 'contemporary.s.01', 'experience.n.01']","['modernity.n.01', 'thai.a.01', 'act.v.03', 'soap_opera.n.01', 'spirit.n.04', 'television.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/haunted_houses_02_copy.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/haunted_houses_02_copy-300x230.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/haunted-houses/,"['Individual_Personal/4.875', 'Cultural/4.390196078431373']","['Individual_Personal', 'Cultural']",9.265196078431373,"['Media/2.723529411764706', 'Spirituality/2.475', 'Mind/1.6']","['Media', 'Spirituality', 'Mind']",6.798529411764706,"['Cultural/34.780471162824114', 'Individual_Personal/15.958949220713928', 'Material_Physical/10.2462566673093']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Material_Physical']",60.98567705084734,"['Media/10.254638009049774', 'Arts/7.623432449903038', 'Mind/7.415158371040723']","['Media', 'Arts', 'Mind']",25.293228829993538,0.8,0.6666666666666666
Araya Rasdjarmrearnsook,"The Class (2005) by Araya Rasdjarmrearnsook challenges the viewer’s personal sense of morality and tolerance by depicting a classroom from hell. In the video, a woman, dressed in black with a white over shirt, stands in front of a long blackboard. The classroom’s rear walls and floor are covered in taut white fabric, given the room the sinister appearance of a sanitarium or a crime scene. Six bodies lay across the floor on silver morgue trays, their features all but obscured by gently draped white sheets. The woman at the front of the class begins to lecture to the lifeless bodies with a clear and calm diction. As she turns to address the rear wall, she grabs the chalk and writes her topic on the blackboard: death. She then proceeds with her monologue, discussing how death is addressed and approached from various historical, cultural, and philosophical perspectives. She occasionally addresses the lifeless bodies, imploring them to share their own perspectives and experiences. She continues to speak, undeterred by the lack of response or reciprocity. Deliberately absurdist in its premise, Rasdjarmrearnsook’s video parodies pedagogical conventions, and the metaphor here of the corpse-as-student plays off humorous tropes of being literally “bored to death.” But in opening a conversation about death – which is often considered too taboo to casually discuss in many cultures (and particularly in the West) – Rasdjarmrearnsook also questions how we treat conversations around mortality in public discourse and how those dialogues, while vital, all too often fall upon deaf ears until it is too late.","Araya Rasdjarmrearnsoon began producing film and video-based work in the 1990s.

Qiu Anxiong,"A Portrait: Covering and Cleaning is an installation of six black-and-white video projections. Each video depicts a portrait with features changing continuously and quickly into different persons, animals and symbols. Driven by the evolving contents of the screen itself, this piece showcases the form and material of Qiu Anxiong’s working method, which relies on precisely planned storyboard sketches drawn in pen on A4 paper. After the narrative is fully formed, Qiu transfers each image by painting it onto a small canvas with acrylic, which can be quickly wiped away to prepare for the subsequent image or element to be painted on top. Such process distills an aesthetics of over-painting that drives narrative development through changing logical relationships between material and form rather than plot elements.","Qiu Anxiong is part of a new generation of Chinese artists synthesizing Chinese culture and history with global contemporary art through addressing new utopias produced by real conditions of globalization. After studying at the Sichuan Art Academy in Chongqing, China and graduating with emphases in contemporary international art and traditional Chinese culture from University of Kassel’s College of Art in Germany, Qiu rose to international prominence in the 2006 Shanghai Biennial with a video work titled New Book of the Mountains and Seas. New Book of the Mountains and Seas is an animated ink work that appropriates the “Book of the Mountains and Seas”, a classical text mapping out the numinous geography of ancient China, to address the relationship between contemporary Chinese subjects and their natural environment through images of paradise and apocalypse.",Portrait: Cover and Clean,Asia,"['narrative.s.01', 'portrayal.n.01', 'material.n.01', 'method.n.01', 'aesthetics.n.01', 'pull.v.01', 'form.v.01', 'component.n.01', 'form.n.01', 'development.n.01', 'animal.n.01', 'projection.n.01', 'feature.n.01', 'video.n.01', 'symbol.n.01', 'screen.n.01', 'person.n.01', 'paper.n.01', 'elements.n.01', 'image.n.01', 'relationship.n.01', 'procedure.n.01', 'piece.n.01']","['materiality.n.02', 'transmutation.n.01', 'portraiture.n.02', 'screen.n.01', 'sequence.n.01', 'narrative.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/img_7510_web.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/img_7510_web-224x300.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/portrait-cover-and-clean/,"['Cultural/5.0982047192573505', 'Material_Physical/4.507167832167832', 'Individual_Personal/3.223529411764706']","['Cultural', 'Material_Physical', 'Individual_Personal']",12.828901963189889,"['Materiality/2.832167832167832', 'Arts/2.411336032388664', 'Fantasy/1.9090909090909092']","['Materiality', 'Arts', 'Fantasy']",7.152594773647405,"['Cultural/19.462826372114307', 'Individual_Personal/18.845459708849805', 'Society/15.229517850570483']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Society']",53.53780393153459,"['Mind/7.366502228421733', 'Arts/7.300224921277552', 'Environmental/5.1992673992673994']","['Mind', 'Arts', 'Environmental']",19.865994548966682,0.6666666666666666,0.3333333333333333
Leung Chi Wo and Wong Sara,"Office Lady with a Red Umbrella restages a figure from a 1980 postcard made from a photograph from 1950’s. The retro-glamor of the 1950s style is restyled devoid of the original context of a Hong Kong street scene, where the “office lady” is walking on Queens Road of the Central district. With the “office lady” facing away from the viewer with a bare background, an introspective tone is created in Leung’s restaging while highlighting the red umbrella resonating with a red pencil skirt emblematic of the identity of the professional urban woman when Hong Kong was under British rule.","Leung Chi Wo tends to highlight in his art the boundaries between viewing and voyeurism, real and fictional, and art and the everyday. Leung is generally concerned with aspects of photography that are not strictly visual and often considers the local population and sites in his photographic installations to reflect a deeper critical engagement with globalization and global consumerism. Working often with pinhole photography and mixed media while exploring cityscapes, Leung focuses on the emotional expressions of the urban man through figural portraiture. Specifically, his photography captures the identity and politics of Hong Kong after its return to China in relation to his photographed subjects.",Office Lady With A Red Umbrella,Asia,"['red.s.01', 'rule.n.01', 'british.a.01', 'district.n.01', 'tone.n.01', 'background.n.01', 'original.s.01', 'urban.a.01', 'street.n.01', 'woman.n.01', 'identity.n.01', 'context.n.01', 'manner.n.01', 'figure.n.01', 'make.v.03', 'scene.n.01', 'spectator.n.01', 'photograph.n.01']","['identity.n.02', 'voyeurism.n.01', 'globalization.n.01', 'consumerism.n.01', 'photography.n.01', 'reenactment.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/leung_chi_wo_and_sara_wong_office_lady_with_a_red_umbrella_web.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/leung_chi_wo_and_sara_wong_office_lady_with_a_red_umbrella_web-200x300.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/office-lady-with-a-red-umbrella/,"['Cultural/9.098997493734336', 'Society/6.127272727272727', 'Individual_Personal/5.814682539682539']","['Cultural', 'Society', 'Individual_Personal']",21.040952760689603,"['Arts/6.7370927318295735', 'Economy/3.709090909090909', 'Mind/2.4527777777777775']","['Arts', 'Economy', 'Mind']",12.89896141869826,"['Individual_Personal/13.191416916416918', 'Material_Physical/12.386813186813187', 'Society/11.978998778998779']","['Individual_Personal', 'Material_Physical', 'Society']",37.557228882228884,"['Urbanization/9.463736263736264', 'Land/9.027106227106227', 'Identity/7.344988344988344']","['Urbanization', 'Land', 'Identity']",25.835830835830834,0.6666666666666666,0.0
Jess,"Untitled (Disneyland Opens) is a collage by Jess that refers back to the inauguration of Disneyland in Anaheim, California in 1955, and suggests an alternate, more sinister version of events. The inaugural celebrations themselves are remembered for being tumultuous. The great popularity of the opening—together with thousands of counterfeited invitation passes—drew enormous and unexpected crowds that the park was not prepared for. Food and drinks ran out early on and several incidents such as a gas leak, broken rides, and an overcrowded steamboat that nearly capsized were reported. Jess’ modification of iconic images from the event adds a surreal and dark tone to the already chaotic scene: in his collage, a giant bee and other giant insects menacingly hover over the castle, and a Hippopotamus in an aggressive stance launches towards what now appear to be panicked crowds running for cover. As per several of his other collage works, Untitled (Disneyland Opens) is characterised by a restrained colour palette incorporating black-and-white cut outs and sepia tones, as well as by a playful approach to scale through the use of found imagery.","Jess Collins (most commonly known as Jess), is a celebrated San Francisco artist known for his highly symbolic paintings and layered collages that combine imagery from mythology, alchemy, popular culture and the male body. He originally studied chemistry, and after being drafted into the military at a young age, he worked in a plutonium mining project for manufacturing atomic bombs, and later in a project focusing on atomic energy. His growing concern for the threat that atomic weaponry posed to our planet is said to be one of the factors that led him to abandon his work as a scientist to pursue art full-time. Jess then became a pivotal figure of the Bay Area’s artistic and literary scene, not only through his work as an artist but through his lifelong romantic partnership and artistic collaboration with postwar American poet Robert Duncan. Akin to Duncan’s idiosyncratic poems, Jess’ paintings draw on myth, occultism and religion, often expressed through the dense layering of found images sourced from book illustrations and comic strips that the artist salvaged during his frequent walks around San Francisco’s thrift stores and book shops.",Untitled (Disneyland Opens),Americas,"['collage.n.01', 'tone.n.01', 'event.n.01', 'food.n.01', 'remember.v.01', 'imagination.n.02', 'playful.a.01', 'california.n.01', 'version.n.01', 'iconic.a.01', 'approach.n.01', 'scene.n.01', 'image.n.01']","['disneyland.n.01', 'phantasmagoric.s.01', 'attack.n.05', 'monster.n.01', 'insect.n.01', 'crowd.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_Jess_Disneyland-Opens-WEB.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_Jess_Disneyland-Opens-WEB-233x300.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/untitled-disneyland-opens/,"['Society/5.051448551448551', 'Cultural/3.4763071895424837', 'Material_Physical/3.3957934050813305']","['Society', 'Cultural', 'Material_Physical']",11.923549146072364,"['Fantasy/3.4763071895424837', 'Violence/1.7705627705627704', 'Mind/1.6470588235294117']","['Fantasy', 'Violence', 'Mind']",6.893928783634665,"['Cultural/11.504737239025166', 'Material_Physical/9.768009768009769', 'Individual_Personal/5.836028986493383']","['Cultural', 'Material_Physical', 'Individual_Personal']",27.10877599352832,"['Mind/4.136780866192631', 'Land/3.8632478632478633', 'Culture/3.307692307692308']","['Mind', 'Land', 'Culture']",11.307721037132803,0.6666666666666666,0.3333333333333333

Diverging from the placid sunny landscapes and non-objective abstract painting that characterized Bay Area painting of the time, Weeks instead chose to depict aspects of American life in a different light.

Carolina Caycedo,"YUMA o la tierra de los amigos (YUMA, or the Land of Friends) is a large mural containing a series of satellite photographs mounted on acrylic. The mural contrasts and mixes multiple layers of these satellite images capturing the progressive devastation of the El Quimbo dam on the Yuma river (Magdalena), in the Department of Huila. The project was originally produced for the 8th Berlin Biennale, and developed out of the artist’s research into waterways, their political and cultural impact, and their historical development. In this work she focuses on the particular case of the El Quimbo Dam in Colombia, a dam along the Magdalena River and the first hydroelectric power project in Colombia to be constructed by a transnational, private corporation, signifying the transition of this geographically, ecologically and historically important public body of water into a privatized resource. The dam’s construction required the redirection of the Magdalena River, the main fluvial artery in the county, affecting a vast area and displacing the indigenous population of the region. Through this case, Caycedo investigates the destructive cultural and environmental consequences of erecting dams, as well as the desire to master the course of nature and the complicity of state power in quelling social unrest.","Carolina Caycedo engages with issues and contexts that affect a broad public on an everyday level: in her work, art functions as a pretext for offering up utopian models to inhabit a world in which individuals and communities are increasingly subject to com-modification, exploitation, and discrimination.","YUMA, or the Land of Friends",Americas,"['river.n.01', 'power.n.01', 'undertaking.n.01', 'population.n.01', 'region.n.01', 'private.a.01', 'passage.n.01', 'development.n.01', 'multiple.a.01', 'water.n.01', 'land.n.01', 'impact.n.01', 'desire.n.01', 'contrast.n.01', 'layer.n.01', 'produce.v.01', 'construction.n.01', 'construct.v.01', 'consequence.n.01', 'public.a.01', 'historical.a.01', 'nature.n.01', 'cultural.a.01', 'political.a.01', 'social.a.01']","['mapmaking.n.01', 'devastation.n.01', 'ecology.n.01', 'autochthonal.s.01', 'supplanting.n.01', 'exploitation.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_LOFMural-WEB.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_LOFMural-WEB-300x200.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/yuma-land-friends/,"['Politics/4.6', 'Individual_Personal/4.234920634920635', 'Cultural/3.298529411764706']","['Politics', 'Individual_Personal', 'Cultural']",12.133450046685342,"['Geopolitics/2.0', 'Familial/1.657142857142857', 'Identity/1.0']","['Geopolitics', 'Familial', 'Identity']",4.657142857142857,"['Individual_Personal/19.625030834318764', 'Society/18.442735188787825', 'Material_Physical/18.17603261032054']","['Individual_Personal', 'Society', 'Material_Physical']",56.243798633427126,"['Emotion/12.381618381618384', 'Arts/6.306435394670689', 'Economy/4.82457264957265']","['Emotion', 'Arts', 'Economy']",23.512626425861725,0.3333333333333333,0.0

Sahej Rahal,"Within the narrative of Sahej Rahal’s The rocks we will find, beings perform absurd acts in derelict corners of the city, emerging into the everyday as if from the cracks of our civilization, transforming them into liminal sites of ritual, and challenging ways in which we experience time and space.

Anna-Bella Papp,"Untitled exemplifies the format that Anna Bella-Papp most commonly works in, using her hands to create delicate tablet-like reliefs within a rectangular form made out of clay. The lack of any glazes and other finishes used in traditionally in ceramics is a deliberate decision with an aim to preserve the pale hues and natural qualities of the clay.  Papp’s decision to display the pieces resting flat on table tops, invites us to imagine them as landscapes or architectural structures seen from a bird’s-eye view.  In this piece, the lines and stark formalism of the composition—the shape of a vertically oriented oval that has been cut out inside the rectangular tablet sitting beside a second oval-shaped incision that is deeper at one end—are reminiscent of Oscar Niemeyer’s modernist buildings or the amspaces built by Mies Van der rohe.  In contrast to the monumental architecture it may suggest, the humble scale of Untitled (comparable to A4 paper size) demands a degree of proximity and intimacy with the viewer. Upon closer inspection it becomes clear: far from being models or maquettes, each permutation and trace of the artist’s hand is an object of beauty in itself.","Anna Bella-Papp recalls how intuitive it felt the first time she modelled something out of clay as a child.  As something derived from the ground under us, clay always felt simple and familiar to her, and in part it’s that sense of immediacy that led her to work exclusively with unglazed and unfired clay.    Papp’s hand-sculpted reliefs are modest in scale and consistently follow the format of a rectangle, which she then subtly modifies with unique incisions or marks, either building up or carving out parts of their surface. Working systematically within the same format allows for small changes and nuances to be imbued with meaning—each new mark becoming an experiment to gauge what range of expression can be wrought by such limited means. The result is a very palpable physicality evoked by simple and subtle forms.    Working with and preserving the natural properties of clay is also important for Papp. Grey, white and ivory hues, and traces of fingerprints are left intentionally as clues that tell the story of where the material came from and how the object was made. Unlike stone, clay is constantly evolving—moving, contracting and changing color over time. Embracing this state of flux, Papp adjusts her body in relation to the clay as it changes, oscillating between making a mark and relinquishing control.",Untitled,Europe,"['piece.n.01', 'purpose.n.01', 'architectural.a.01', 'beauty.n.01', 'hands.n.01', 'trace.n.01', 'format.n.01', 'degree.n.01', 'contrast.n.01', 'model.n.01', 'quality.n.01', 'line.n.01', 'architecture.n.01', 'scale.n.01', 'natural.a.01', 'hand.n.01', 'paper.n.01', 'structure.n.01', 'building.n.01', 'shape.n.01', 'construct.v.01', 'position.n.03', 'make.v.03', 'spectator.n.01', 'landscape.n.01']","['architectural.a.01', 'repetition.n.02', 'system.n.01', 'model.n.04', 'ceramic.n.01', 'relief.n.10']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_Anna-Bella-Papp_Untitled-42_1_WEB.png,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_Anna-Bella-Papp_Untitled-42_1_WEB-300x199.png,https://kadist.org/work/untitled-anna-bella/,"['Cultural/24.708531320760432', 'Material_Physical/4.138461538461539', 'Society/3.9162393162393165']","['Cultural', 'Material_Physical', 'Society']",32.76323217546128,"['Arts/9.114016848304775', 'Technology/5.623529411764705', 'Media/5.146148459383753']","['Arts', 'Technology', 'Media']",19.883694719453235,"['Cultural/20.58781512605043', 'Society/13.884371184371187', 'Individual_Personal/10.730244918480215']","['Cultural', 'Society', 'Individual_Personal']",45.20243122890184,"['Arts/11.095507433742728', 'Materiality/5.091452991452991', 'Economy/4.71025641025641']","['Arts', 'Materiality', 'Economy']",20.89721683545213,0.6666666666666666,0.3333333333333333
Annette Kelm,"Percent for Art is seemingly concerned with “art enrichment” by  state or city arts agencies role in it, managing the artist rosters, maintaining public art collections, commissioning artworks,  selecting installation sites, among other things for aesthetic and cultural enhancement in both public and private real estate developments. For some, it’s also an opportunity to have desperately needed revenue to counter the displacement of artists and preserve a city or state’s creative spirit. The work, with its serial repetition of percentage signs across six separate bright red panels, appears as splashy retail signage for no apparent sale. Its apparent emptiness reflects the limited documentation that we have of private developments, in which public information is missing and there’s no way to evaluate overall if percent for art programs are achieving its goals.  The photographic works of the Berlin-based artist Annette Kelm often feature a single, vaguely familiar object, which she renders using a direct and realistic style that oscillates between genres, such as documentary and advertising.

Douglas Gordon,"Douglas Gordon’s single-channel video The Left Hand Can’t See That The Right Hand is Blind, captures an unfolding scene between two hands in leather gloves—at first seemingly comfortable to be entwined, and later, engaged in a struggle. As suggested by the work’s title, each of the hands assumes a character with a distinct personality, as if we were witnessing a lovers’ quarrel and embrace, or the embodiment of opposing forces of an internal struggle.  Gordon has previously created performance-based works depicting his own body or parts of it—arms, hands, fingers, eyes—usually enacting simple, repetitive movements. Hands, in particular, have held his interest due to their ability to evoke internal emotional states and express aspects of identity, sexuality, fetishism and even our ability to communicate. These characterizations suggested by simple movements reflect his ongoing interest in notions of the ego, and internal struggles—and are illustrative of the formal techniques of doubling and mirroring, which can be seen in several of his works.","Douglas Gordon is a celebrated Scottish artist whose work revolves around the themes of memory, time and our perception of it. Spanning across film, video, installation, photography, and sculpture, his work offers a new experience of the cinematic in the space of contemporary art, creating what critic Dominique Païni described as ‘exhibition cinema.’   Interested in how we experience temporality, Gordon has often slowed down either original or appropriated footage in order to play with the viewers’ perception. An example is his celebrated work 24 Hour Psycho (1993), in which Gordon stretched the duration of Alfred Hitchcock’s iconic movie to last 24 hours. This gesture both monumentalized time and intensified the imagery, structurally reframing the film by shifting our perception away from the movie’s original narrative and directing it towards the finer details that constitute every single frame.  Several of his works incorporate that universal dichotomies: of life and death, innocence and guilt, and dual identities. Harboring the tension between opposing forces, Gordon then employs formal strategies of repetition, mirroring, and doubling to construct a deliberate ambiguity and multiplicity of meaning.",The Left Hand Can't See That the Right Hand is Blind,Europe,"['hands.n.01', 'struggle.n.01', 'hand.n.01', 'motion.n.03', 'force.n.01', 'keep.v.01', 'formal.a.01', 'aspect.n.01', 'technique.n.01', 'simple.a.01', 'impression.n.01', 'identity.n.01', 'fictional_character.n.01', 'title.n.01', 'make.v.03', 'scene.n.01', 'body.n.01', 'video.n.01']","['hands.n.01', 'glove.n.02', 'leather.n.01', 'conflict.n.01', 'struggle.n.01', 'dominance.n.02', 'couple.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_Douglas-Gordon_Left-Hand-Cant-See-Right-Hand-Blind-WEB.png,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_Douglas-Gordon_Left-Hand-Cant-See-Right-Hand-Blind-WEB-300x240.png,https://kadist.org/work/left-hand-blind/,"['Politics/9.77008547008547', 'Society/6.691452991452992', 'Individual_Personal/3.971794871794872']","['Politics', 'Society', 'Individual_Personal']",20.43333333333333,"['Power/6.48974358974359', 'Inequality/2.4803418803418804', 'Environmental/2.307692307692308']","['Power', 'Inequality', 'Environmental']",11.277777777777779,"['Individual_Personal/19.30519806990396', 'Material_Physical/14.536000257052892', 'Cultural/11.201596279537458']","['Individual_Personal', 'Material_Physical', 'Cultural']",45.04279460649431,"['Space/8.045401966454598', 'Values/5.85845004668534', 'Identity/4.797979797979798']","['Space', 'Values', 'Identity']",18.70183181111974,0.3333333333333333,0.0
Yu Honglei,"Yu Honglei’s video and mixed media works riff on familiar motifs from the Western art historical canon and reimagine them through a playful but subversive culture jamming of their original meaning. Life (2013), for example, depicts a tiled backdrop of various images and stills associated with the work of American Pop artist Andy Warhol. Digital reproductions of his silkscreens featuring public figures like Elizabeth Taylor, Chairman Mao, and Debbie Harry form an amalgamation of modern art iconography, while repeated images of Warhol himself serve as a constant reminder that even after his death, the artist is still decidedly present in our art historical consciousness. A vintage Ken doll stands in the foreground and functions as its own nod to a kind of mass-produced iconography. Clad in a shimmering purple jacket with a Mandarin collar and red and black stripe detail throughout, the Ken doll is fully market as a retrograde artifact and an object quite literally out of time. Throughout, subtitles add another layer of narrativized humor and commentary, and in one still, the Ken doll appears to declare, “This is all Andy’s fault.” The juxtaposition between various signifiers of manufacture– the reproducible art object as epitomized by Warhol’s Factory and the mass-produced consumer toy as represented by the Ken doll – suggests that contemporary art production is not entirely distant from the ethics (or lack thereof) of wide-scale production of consumer goods. While deliberately funny and even playful, Life also raises critical questions how our perception of art is inescapably mediated by the cultures of simulacra and reproducibility inherent to our post-industrial cultural context.","Yu Honglei produces video and mixed media works that frequently take everyday objects as their starting points. Through playful re-arrangement of familiar elements and motifs from the cannon of Western art history, Yu imagines new and productive possibilities for creative materials rendered all-too-familiar in books and media. His work examines the translation of imagery through art over time, but at the same time, he approaches canonical works with irreverence, acting with the impetus to “culture jam” common cultural texts and to allow viewers to see them anew.

Zai Kuning,"Justice (2014) presents viewers with a curious assemblage: a wooden gallows with slightly curved spindles protruding from the topmost plank, which in turn is covered with rudimentary netting, the threads slackly dangling like a loose spider’s web or an rib cage that’s been cracked open. A bundle of small red rattan balls hang from the front end of the plank, precariously knotted to a single thread hanging from the gallows’ edge. A book hangs from similar red threads at the plank’s rear, its surfaced wrapped multiple times over with the thread to hold it in place, the red thread resembling blood vessels or connective tissue. A strange substance covers the book’s surface: translucent manila-hued beeswax that gives it a cream-colored luster. This assemblage bears anthropological significance, as Zai notes, Justice reimagines the life worlds of the Orang Laut, an indigenous nomadic tribe from Indonesia’s Riau Archipelago that migrates through maritime travel but that has become increasingly displaced and marginalized in recent years. Each component of his installation, by extension, draws inspiration from different objects that Zai found amongst the Orang Laut during his fifteen years of researching the tribe. Zai tellingly does not allow his work to slip entirely towards ethnography, and he does not describe the use value for these objects, presenting Justice instead as a creative rendering of the Orang Laut’s “world” through a composite of their accumulated ephemera. Justice functions as both an imaginary artifact as well as an artistic statement of resistance against forms of cultural imperialism that threatens to erase non-mainstream cultures.","Zai Kuning is one of Singapore’s leading avant-garde practitioners.

Zai Kuning,"Converting is a piece about the Orang Laut, often called Sea Nomads, that inhabited the Riau archipelago. They were Christians and pagans that were often oppressed by the majority Muslims in the Riau community and were eventually forced to convert to Islam. Zai conveyed this history in Converting through the stark contrasts of red, white, black. Bound together by an island-like black earthy mass, white bubbles resembling clusters of embryonic cells or a sack of seeds marked with different religious symbols in blood red in the center, some with Christian crosses, some with Islamic crescents, with others remaining indecipherable or blank.

Andrew Grassie,"In 2008, Grassie was invited by the Whitechapel Gallery to document the transformation of some of its spaces. The artist chose to depict the space before and after, thus creating the series titled “After the Archive Collections Room.” This group of paintings displays a space locked into time with its scaffolding and broom exposed, depicted just before an exhibition on a collection of archives.","The hyper-realistic paintings of Andrew Grassie combine know-how and classic technique with a conceptual approach. “Painting as document” as the artist suggests consists of exhibition or studio views that are photographed and maintain their same scale. The question of the exhibition, the choice of works, and their hanging appears central to Andrew Grassie who like a curator creates protocols to create his series. In “Group Show” (2003), he assembles a group of works, photographs them one by one, and uses the photographic support putting as a matrix for further paintings.  The exhibition only exists through this final painting, like in his other project “Tate New Hang” (2004-05) which shows points of view of the hanging of the collection, later to be realized to be in painting. The paintings are hung in the location suggested by the terms described.  Andrew Grassie was born in 1966 in Edinburgh, UK.

Artur Zmijewski,"Zeppelintribüne (2002) was shot near the Zepelintribune in Nuremberg, designed by Albert Speer, chief architect of the Third Reich. The 360-metre-long structure is part of a larger architectural complex called the Zeppelinfeld, which the National Socialist used for their marches and rallies. The Zeppelintribune was immortalized in the Leni Reifenstahl’s film-propaganda masterpiece the Triumph of the Will, a record of a 1934 Nazi Party rally. The Zeppeltribune was destroyed by degrees, beginning as early as 1945, when the Americans, who held a victory parade there, blew up a large swastika on the roof. In the 60s, the columns and side-reinforcement were removed, further stripping the ruin of embarrassing architectural allusions to the past. Zmijewski thought of it as a place of pilgrimage for tourists, also as a neglected and dirty place in Germany. In this work, he alludes to how the nation inadvertently works in solidarity to destroy the past. The film features fragments of fascist newsreels from the 1930s, mixed with Zmijewski’s own footage of a pair of Turkish artists in residence in Germany, dubbed the Arbeitsmänner (“workmen”).  Shovel in hand, the artists parade around with spades in front of the tribune, parodying the military drill ritual leaving us with a film about impersonation and memory, memory so perverse that it persuades tourists to raise their hand in the gesture of the Nazi salute.","In most of his work Artur Zmijewski uses the same tested method: he devises a scenario, sets up a situation, and introduces a group of individuals to participate and experiment with how they react. He films them and rarely takes part in the act himself. The other half of his work consists in editing the material. Through editing, Zmijewski sets up his argument, emphasizes important moments, and conjures, more than often, a highly emotive plot, which leaves the films looking like self-directed documentaries. An inseparable part of this strategy is exposing the project’s participants to the experience of emotion, where more than often he is personally involved. The nature of his work, an inseparable connection to documentation and the truth of human emotions, betrays the syndrome of disbelief in representation, depiction, and mediated expression. The artist belongs to a generation of Polish artists who in the 1990s experienced the transformation of their world, a transformation that language failed to keep pace with. The exhaustion of language, the wearing away of public discourse, is doubtless a measure of the crisis of social communication. The strangeness of the seemingly familiar body is also one of Zmijewski’s major themes. It can be literal and occur in prosaic circumstances stripped of any surrealist marvel. And yet it has explosive force and political effects.

Pascal Grandmaison,"Solo (2003) is a video exhibited as a video/sound installation depicting shots of drum, voice, guitar, clavier/synthesizer, and a melodica player cut into segmented fragments from the perspective of a studio recording set. Rather than deploying a narrative strategy, Grandmaison focuses on the gestures of the musicians and the repetitions they carry out when recording their individual tracks. The musicians are portrayed nodding, dancing, improvising, strumming, creating resonance that is repeated over and over– however, Grandmaison is sure not to document their entire faces or expressions while they perform, just details. Similar to that of a “jam,” close attention is granted to the exertion of the camera and how it portrays the framing of sequences. What one can pick up from the segments, especially those of voice recording, is a modified reworking of Anne Clark’s 1980’s track “Sleeper in the Metropolis.”","Marked by an apparent austerity and meticulousness, Pascal Grandmaison’s works display a disconcerting aloofness from the world, a clearly asserted detachment from reality. The subjects that interest the artist primarily deal with the means by which humans try to grasp their world, both visually and intellectually. The artist employs photography, video, and sculpture in order to compose a vision of what some have termed “troubling strangeness.” Overturning conventional codes of visual analysis, Grandmaison focuses on inanimate subjects that, once disassociated from their familiar environment, are re-contextualized through his cold gaze. His depictions do not exist as stories instead he reverses viewpoints and inverts color codes. His photographs and video works are generally black and white, giving them a monotone feel. A constant visual repetition in his work is his rigorously impersonal gaze. As a keen observer, he meticulously scrutinizes the world around him, analyzing it through the lens of a camera. Grandmaison is interested in the appearance of things and non-beings and, more rarely, of beings themselves. When human figures do appear in his work, they are presented in an inexpressive, impassive, distant way, equated to the role of an object.Pascal Grandmaison was born in Montreal, Canada, in 1975.",Solo,Americas,"['voice.n.01', 'scheme.n.01', 'repeat.n.01', 'fragment.n.01', 'sequence.n.01', 'expression.n.01', 'details.n.01', 'studio.n.01', 'attention.n.01', 'set.n.01', 'shooting.n.01', 'individual.a.01', 'narrative.s.01', 'gesture.n.01', 'position.n.03', 'camera.n.01', 'city.n.01', 'video.n.01']","['recording_studio.n.01', 'division.n.12', 'repetition.n.02', 'musicianship.n.01', 'detachment.n.02', 'scrutiny.n.02']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Grandmaison-Solo-stillsite.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Grandmaison-Solo-stillsite-300x169.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/solo/,"['Cultural/4.061988304093568', 'Individual_Personal/4.012698412698413', 'Material_Physical/3.504201680672269']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Material_Physical']",11.57888839746425,"['Time/3.504201680672269', 'Politics/2.4363636363636365', 'Body/2.4126984126984126']","['Time', 'Politics', 'Body']",8.353263729734318,"['Material_Physical/9.11897040867629', 'Politics/8.05452356381149', 'Society/7.6126432219311475']","['Material_Physical', 'Politics', 'Society']",24.786137194418927,"['Politics/4.0', 'Urbanization/3.623529411764706', 'Time/3.5013736263736264']","['Politics', 'Urbanization', 'Time']",11.124903038138331,0.3333333333333333,0.6666666666666666
Allan McCollum,"In the work titled The Glossies (1980), an affinity for photography manifested itself before McCollum actually began to use photography as a medium. The Glossies are drawings, rectangular forms applied with blank ink and watercolors, which fill up the sheets parallel to the edges except for a small margin. Finally, the whole paper is covered with an adhesive plastic laminate, which gives it the shiny surface of a photograph. The drawing as original artistic expression is employed as a sign for photography. In this respect, The Glossies marks a decisive transition to the “Plaster Surrogates”, a multi-phase work, which McCollum began to create in 1982.  Discussing the Plaster Surrogates in a 1985 interview, McCollum described his practice as “a sort of ‘working to rule’”: a job action in which workers do precisely and only what is required contractually, both refusing excess work and excessively observing rules and regulations. “In a sense, I’m doing just the minimum that is required of an artist and no more.” Each and every Surrogate is signed dated and numbered. Although McCollum works with assistants, he insists on painting the outer edge of every black center and the inner edge of every border. No two surrogates are identical; all those of the same dimensions have slightly different colored borders and vice versa. There is nothing false about the objects themselves. McCollum doesn’t employ illusionism or trompe l’oeil. His Surrogates aren’t forgeries of paintings. They’re not even paintings – only plaster objects, which may, at a distance, resemble framed images. The artist proceeded to hang his Surrogate Paintings in larger groups and in a relatively order less way, side by side and one beneath the other. By his increase of quantity and the effect of repetition, he intended likewise to interpret this exaggerated idea of an installation as a sign and to exclude any kind of view, which emphasizes the importance of the single picture. The surrogates, via their reduced attributes and their relentless sameness, started working to render the gallery into a quasi-theatrical space which seemed to “stand for” a gallery; and by extension, this rendered the artist into a caricature of the artist, the viewers performers.","Allan McCollum neither superimposes the conditions of industrial production as artistic practice nor attempts to raise them, in a heroic gesture, to the status of high art. The starting point of his art generally surrounds the idea of a sign. He frames the sign inside of realm of the significant characteristics of the total quantity of all pictures in general. These considerations are the result of an inconsistency of art production in relation to culture at large and the function it fulfills.

Szabolcs Kisspál,"Lifesize Draft is the second of two sculptures on a similar theme, the first one being Utopia Battery, (2008). The latter is also in an edition of 3, one of which is in the collection of the Ludwig Muzeum, Budapest. Although Lifesize Draft was made after Utopia Battery, Kisspal conceived it more or less at the same time and sees the two works as closely related. Both take as their central motifs the red flag. Whereas in Utopia Battery the flag unravels and the thread is coiled into spools as a direct result of the intervention of people in the room (the unravelling is activated by a motion sensor), in Lifesize Draft the flag is in a fixed almost completely unravelled state, the wool being in a giant ball. It is unclear therefore whether the flag is being unravelled – the communist régime deconstructed – or remade – a new utopia under construction. Within the installation there is a DVD of found footage of American citizens knitting, predominantly during the Second World War, although some footage is from the First World War, to help the war effort by making socks for the troops. Among those shown knitting are President Roosevelt and his wife. There is a sense of community that ought to be the fundamental basis of any model state but which was lacking in former Communist regimes. Kisspal thus appears tentatively to propose the possible reformulation of a social model which may or may not be Marxian. He refers to a recent revival of interest in Marx in Germany during the recent Financial crisis and state intervention in the banking industry as examples of a return to or interest in state control.","Kisspal is an Hungarian artist based in Budapest. His work engages with the social and political circumstances in which he lives and the rôle of the artist in society, particularly in the post-communist world. Kisspal’s recent works question not only the legacy of Communism but also the legacy of the recent failures of capitalism. Like many artists in former eastern Europe his work displays some ambivalence about the current situation as well as hope for a more structured and controlled continuing emancipation. Kisspal works with photography, moving image and sculpture.  Kisspal was born in Marosvásárhely, Hungary, in 1967.

Vidya Gastaldon,"Gastaldon has made a number of soft sculptures using materials associated with knitting and sewing that have alternately fetishistic, nightmarish or contemplative qualities. “Floating Mountain” is one of a group of works made from wool that overtly depict mountain forms. Suspended from the ceiling, the sculpture floats just above the floor. In the form of a mountain with a colored top, the sculpture recalls images of Mount Fuji, normally shrouded in snow, and memorialized in countless Japanese woodcuts. Mount Hemo, however, after which the work is named, was famously climbed by King Philip V of Macedonia, a feat that was alluded to by Petrarch in his own ascent of Mont Ventoux. Philip was a warrior king who fought the Romans and allied himself with Hannibal. The obvious link with the form of a mountain is complemented by the visual affinity of the work with a costume, possibly a bridal gown with its delicate filigree. The softness of the form and texture recalls the body. The presence of blood red suggests a carnal reading, the passage from innocence and virginity to knowledge and experience. The work thus unites landscape, sexuality and femininity within a single form whose delicacy and lightness suggests something dreamlike and ephemeral. The work is made via knitted yarn; has a makeshift feel in the sense of improvisation, although Gastaldon is an artist for whom craftsmanship is of great importance. Its craft also suggests the flow of liquid as one color bleeds into another. The linear construction of the object links it to the drawings that the artist makes of fantastical landscapes.","Vidya Gastaldon creates microcosms of hallucinatory, saccharine symbols with her sculptures, drawings, video animations, and prints. Working with mediums traditionally associated with feminine labor, such as knitting, sewing, and crocheting, Gastaldon continues the tradition of feminist trailblazers like Judy Chicago, Mary Kelly, and Rosemarie Trockel, but consciously avoids overt political statements. Eastern religion and new-age spirituality are dominant themes in Gastaldon’s work — especially the idea of transformation. In her sculptures, yarn and thread form mountainous cones and internal organs, while her drawings depict mystical creatures with exaggerated smiley faces that morph into fantastical landscapes. Gastaldon’s embrace of spirituality and psychedelia is genuine, but she also explores mankind’s darker side through her allusions to nuclear destruction and the pervasive imagery of mass marketing.Born in Besancon, Gastaldon lives and works in Geneva.",Floating Mountain (Mt Hemo),Europe,"['mountain.n.01', 'form.n.01', 'sculpture.n.01', 'landscape.n.01', 'ephemeral.s.01', 'reading.n.01', 'brooding.s.01', 'passage.n.01', 'japanese.a.01', 'floor.n.01', 'red.s.01', 'quality.n.01', 'name.v.01', 'construction.n.01', 'individual.a.01', 'presence.n.01', 'color.n.01', 'sense.n.01', 'drawing.n.01', 'ocular.a.02', 'material.n.01', 'body.n.01']","['bodily.s.02', 'mountain.n.01', 'textile.a.01', 'gender_identity.n.01', 'blood.n.01', 'fabric.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Gastaldon.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Gastaldon-200x300.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/floating-mountain/,"['Cultural/6.384615384615384', 'Individual_Personal/4.36060606060606', 'Society/3.91025641025641']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Society']",14.655477855477855,"['Identity/4.36060606060606', 'Arts/2.5384615384615383', 'Economy/2.371794871794872']","['Identity', 'Arts', 'Economy']",9.27086247086247,"['Material_Physical/21.773393419446055', 'Cultural/11.410947712418302', 'Individual_Personal/8.43720462543992']","['Material_Physical', 'Cultural', 'Individual_Personal']",41.621545757304276,"['Arts/9.077614379084967', 'Materiality/6.781929181929182', 'Space/6.346153846153846']","['Arts', 'Materiality', 'Space']",22.205697407167996,0.6666666666666666,0.3333333333333333
Hank Willis Thomas,"Shot in black and white and printed on a glittery carborundum surface, Black Hands, White Cotton both confronts and abstracts the subject of its title. As with many of his works, the artist has taken a found image and manipulated it to draw out and dramatize the formal contrast between the black hands holding white cotton. Cotton, of course is one of the most familiar fabric sources to us, and becomes incredibly soft once processed. But at the time that it was being planted and picked by slaves in the United States, was severely abrasive and would lacerate the hands of the slaves dramatically. Not to mention the physical labor involved in picking cotton out in the sweltering hot fields for inhumane periods of time, and the frequent physical abuse endured by slaves in the process. This image, culled from the archives of Jive magazine in San Francisco, and blown up to a pixelated scale therefore demands not only that we confront the history of slavery and racism in the US, but does so by presenting a formal contradiction of a material that appears seductive, glamorous, and ornamental, but of a subject that represents extreme violence and oppression.","Employing the visual language and terminology of mass media, and appropriating symbols and images from popular culture, Hank Willis Thomas’ work seeks to question and subvert established definitions and positions with regards to personal identity and the narrative of race. Working across installation, photography, video, and media work, Thomas maintains his photo conceptualist roots, primarily taking source material from found photographs and archives. These images form the basis from which the artist seeks to uncover the fallacies that history claims as truth. His work illustrates how the way history is represented and consumed reinforces generalizations surrounding identity, gender, race and ethnicity, and that as an artist he has an opportunity to expose or to revise those histories from the points of view of the oppressed.","Black Hands, White Cotton",Americas,"['hands.n.01', 'formal.a.01', 'physical.a.01', 'black.a.01', 'white.a.01', 'subject.n.01', 'white.n.01', 'san_francisco.n.01', 'magazine.n.01', 'pull.v.01', 'black.a.01 white.a.01', 'print.v.01', 'familiar.a.01', 'black.n.01', 'time.n.01', 'fabric.n.01', 'contrast.n.01', 'scale.n.01', 'time_period.n.01', 'shooting.n.01', 'violence.n.01', 'beginning.n.04', 'surface.n.01', 'image.n.01', 'procedure.n.01']","['bondage.n.02', 'history.n.01', 'racism.n.01', 'confrontation.n.01', 'violence.n.01', 'oppression.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/image_hank_willis_thomas_black_hands_white_cotton.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/image_hank_willis_thomas_black_hands_white_cotton-217x300.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/black-hands-white-cotton/,"['Politics/9.659024635495225', 'Society/7.938545767957533', 'Material_Physical/2.509090909090909']","['Politics', 'Society', 'Material_Physical']",20.106661312543665,"['Inequality/6.317848164906988', 'Violence/3.698319327731092', 'Time/2.509090909090909']","['Inequality', 'Violence', 'Time']",12.52525840172899,"['Cultural/36.149546237552705', 'Society/24.55416173094192', 'Material_Physical/13.493151293151294']","['Cultural', 'Society', 'Material_Physical']",74.19685926164593,"['Media/11.683596245515753', 'Arts/8.065811965811966', 'Economy/7.169963369963369']","['Media', 'Arts', 'Economy']",26.919371581291088,0.6666666666666666,0.0

Javier Castro,"In the video Blanco sobre Blanco (White on White), we see a white man appearing in a white screen embedded into a white wall— alluding to Malevich’s White on White series. Analogously, in Castro’s related work Negro sobre Negro (Black on Black) all we see is a completely black screen on a monitor that is recessed into a wall, also painted black. Gradually, the face of a man becomes visible as he steps out of the darkness and closer to the camera. As suggested by Castro, the color of this man’s skin allows him to pass unnoticed perhaps literally, but also metaphorically as he alludes with certain humor to the iconic work Black Square by Suprematist artist Kazimir Malevich, often referred to as the “zero point of painting” in Western art-historical discourses. Together, these works have a conversation: both of them appropriating Malevich’s monochromatic compositions, and conflating formalist discourses with racial and identity politics. Adding to the complexity of these works is the preference that art schools across Cuba and Latin America have given to Western discourses, inferiorizing artistic production from outside the West. Seen through this prism, Castro’s pieces are a poetic and provocative take on resolving formalism from within a body of colour.","Javier Castro was born in the in the neighbourhood of San Isidro in the heart of Habana Vieja, Cuba, where he lives and works. Influenced by the unique historical and present idiosyncrasies that define his neighbourhood—which is famous both as the site of José Martí’s (poet and martyr of the war for independence from Spain) childhood home, and the birthplace and murder of Alberto Yarini, a Cuban pimp, racketeer, and heroic symbol of Cuban identity—he films daily scenes from this area of the city, studying its tensions with an anthropological eye. Although he has previously worked in several media including installation and photography, he grew interested in video because of its ability portray the vitality of the present moment in the most immediate way possible. For Castro, it’s essential to capture reality in its most raw and unadulterated form, and hence he uses as little equipment as possible—no lights, sets or scripts—in order to preserve the natural dynamics of an environment. As a consequence, the people we see in his videos are never subject to artificial conditions. As described by Castro, the neighbourhood is his studio and his role as an artist is not to produce work, but rather to find and capture it without touching it. The social dimension of his practice is also important for Castro. At its very core, his work is about the people that he depicts and his own interrelations with them as another inhabitant of Habana Vieja. It’s this closeness and familiarity that allows him to earn his subjects’ trust, which ultimately leads to their honest portrayal. From his interactions with people emerge questions that speak of the human condition: the economy, language, sexuality, and violence all entangled in the stories of sociality and survival in Havana.",Blanco sobre Blanco (White on White),Americas,"['white.n.01', 'discourse.n.01', 'black.n.01', 'western.a.01', 'white.a.01', 'screen.n.01', 'black.a.01', 'west.n.01', 'square.n.01', 'dark.n.01', 'complexity.n.01', 'school.n.01', 'conversation.n.01', 'united_states.n.01', 'politics.n.01', 'iconic.a.01', 'visible.a.01', 'production.n.01', 'poetic.a.01', 'color.n.01', 'composition.n.01', 'identity.n.01', 'wall.n.01', 'camera.n.01', 'piece.n.01']","['formalism.n.01', 'suprematism.n.01', 'postmodernist.a.01', 'identity.n.01', 'race.n.03', 'square.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/img1_javier_castro_white_on_white.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/img1_javier_castro_white_on_white-300x169.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/blanco-sobre-blanco-white-on-white/,"['Individual_Personal/11.496509209744508', 'Cultural/1.6470588235294117', 'Politics/0.875']","['Individual_Personal', 'Cultural', 'Politics']",14.018568033273919,"['Identity/5.7979797979797985', 'Mind/2.423529411764706', 'Spirituality/1.6']","['Identity', 'Mind', 'Spirituality']",9.821509209744503,"['Material_Physical/14.176745786033715', 'Individual_Personal/11.139005439005443', 'Society/10.364957264957267']","['Material_Physical', 'Individual_Personal', 'Society']",35.68070848999643,"['Land/6.658344579397211', 'Identity/6.43131313131313', 'Language/3.91025641025641']","['Land', 'Identity', 'Language']",16.99991412096675,0.3333333333333333,0.3333333333333333

Jonn Herschend,"Jonn Herschend’s short film Discussion Questions subverts the familiar motifs of contemporary media-based pedagogy through a playful intervention that invites more engaged and active viewership. Commissioned for the 2014 Whitney Biennial, the film is a text-based PowerPoint presentation that becomes a cathartic dance party. Originally screened as part of an extended program with other video works at the Biennial, Discussion Questions is initially presented as a set of questions designed to inspire audience conversation around these films. The rudimentary black and white text breaks down familiar narrative devices such as plot and setting, providing all-too-banal “instruction” on the rudiments of film analysis. The presentation, however, begins to drift off topic, morphing into its own film as the unreliable “narrator” of the presentation works through his delusional romantic issues with a co-worker at the university where he works. Suddenly, a disco beat soundtrack by Silas Hite begins to play, the screen flashing as if it were a strobe light. Hypnotized by the beat and turning of each new sentence, the viewer finds themselves in a dance party, as this sonnet spirals out of the narrator’s control. In reimaging the space of the museum/screening room/lecture hall as a makeshift dance party, Herschend not only satirizes the dry lecture style of academia: he also stakes out a place for a mode of artistic production that actively engages viewers by encouraging them to get out of their seats and onto their feet.","Jonn Herschend is an interdisciplinary artist, filmmaker and experimental publisher whose work explores fiction, reality and the narrative structures that we employ as a way to explain the chaos and clutter of our everyday lives. His videos, performances, installations, and photos all incorporate sterile and formally recognizable structures such as PowerPoint presentations, academic lectures, photographic evidence, infomercials, gallery exhibitions, or educational videos. He uses these structures as a means to investigate the issues of truth and confusion, and allows the messiness of reality to eventually collapse the whole piece. His work has been exhibited nationally and internationally including the Whitney Museum of American Art; the Telluride Film Festival; SITE Santa Fe; and the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art.

Josh Faught,"Some of Faught’s works have been inspired by the ad hoc monuments created at gravesites in San Francisco’s Neptune Society Columbarium, where many victims of the AIDS epidemic were laid to rest. The personal objects, mementos, and offerings left in the cemetery have become something of an archive of a particular moment in queer history and the gay community in the city.  His 2014 sculpture, Edward, is part of a larger series of works that Faught has made to memorialize (or simply recall) his past lovers. Each of the sculptures in the series includes objects relating to a particular person: in Edward, a VHS copy of the 1983 film Silkwood is joined by a abalone ash tray and an overturned mug. Combined with “hand woven gold lame and hemp, hand dyed in shades of Daffodil, Cardinal Red, Raspberry, Indigo, and Teas Leaves to match the color fashion forecast of 2014-2015,” the objects of Edward form a tiny shard of memory, pinpointed in time though not in space, concrete and yet so elusive.","American artist Josh Faught uses weaving, knitting, and crochet as means to making in his textured and evocative sculptures.

Meiro Koizumi,"Words by Meiro Koizumi: “The video installation work In the State of Amnesia is made with Mr. Nobuhiro Tanaka, who damaged his brain when he had an accident when he was 21. Since then he has been living with a memory disorder. I asked Mr. Tanaka to memorize a testimony of a Japanese soldier who served in the war in China during WWII. Unlike in Germany, those testimonies of Japanese as aggressors in the Asian countries have been hidden, repressed, and untold in the Japanese society. Today, 70 years after the end of the war, people almost completely forgot what we did in the continent, and how aggressive we were. During the 2 days of shooting, Mr. Tanaka had to memorize a testimony of a Japanese man who confessed his trauma of killing a small boy while on a secret mission. But because of his memory disorder, the camera captured the situation where the more he tried to remember the words, the less he can remember the lines. And in the end, no words came out of his mouth, and all the words escaped from his memory. This footage was used to create the 2 channel video and sound installation.”","Meiro Koizumi is a Japanese video and performing artist, born in 1976. He has built a compelling body of work that deals with power dynamics on scales from the familial to the national, and examines questions of political and psychological control. Implicating himself, his performers, and the viewer through choreographed emotional manipulations, Koizumi creates works that straddle the uncomfortable and indefinable line between cruelty and comedy.

Che Onejoon,"For the last few years, Che Onejoon has been focusing on the relationships between African countries and North Korea. He has attempted to interpret the ongoing Cold War in the Korean peninsula from a new geopolitical perspective. His resulting body of work focuses on the memorial monuments, statues and architectures that were built in 13 different African countries by North Korean government. Not often talked about, these “gifts” represent North Korea’s strategies using art as propaganda tool to gain support of African dictators in worldwide instances such as the United Nations. Though presumed to blend native African art, the monuments actually display more of North Korean socialist realism. The project is named after North Korea’s massive creative agency called Mansudae Art Studio established in 1959 by the order of Kim Il-sung to build monuments and statues for free, in Africa but not only.  Che’s Mansudae Master Class project is a culminated study on cultural diplomacy, military alliance, translated forms of socialist realism, and images of utopia. Che’s photographs are frontal views of the monuments built by North Korea in the different African countries. Yet, the artist detaches the monuments from their original contexts so it becomes difficult to know where these architectures are located: in Senegal, in North Korea, or elsewhere.  For example, the African Renaissance Monument (2014) features the monument built in 2010 in Dakar, capital of the Senegal, a gigantic bronze statue to herald a new era of the continent.","Che Onejoon started working with photography in mandatory military service as an evidence photographer for the South Korean Combat Police recording different incidents for proof. Working with film, photographs, installations, and archives, Che’s research-based works deals with specific places of Korean society that connote the social and political changes that penetrate modern to contemporary history of the Korean peninsula. Studying the ruins of militarized modernity, Che presents the traces of erasures as sites of negation, disorder, and desertion.",Mansudae Master Class,Asia,"['memorial.n.03', 'african.a.01', 'construct.v.01', 'state.n.04', 'architecture.n.01', 'position.n.03', 'undertaking.n.01', 'ongoing.s.01', 'scheme.n.01', 'native.a.01', 'locate.v.01', 'military.a.01', 'tool.n.01', 'africa.n.01', 'survey.n.01', 'class.n.01', 'era.n.01', 'studio.n.01', 'government.n.01', 'name.v.01', 'original.s.01', 'war.n.01', 'relationship.n.01', 'context.n.01', 'cultural.a.01']","['diplomacy.n.01', 'influence.n.01', 'geopolitics.n.01', 'memorial.n.03', 'memorial.n.03', 'propaganda.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_Independence-Hall-Under-construction-Windhoek-NamibiaWEB.png,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_Independence-Hall-Under-construction-Windhoek-NamibiaWEB-300x204.png,https://kadist.org/work/mansudae-master-class/,"['Cultural/7.999614420667052', 'Society/7.658341658341659', 'Politics/3.6025641025641026']","['Cultural', 'Society', 'Politics']",19.26052018157281,"['Arts/4.7384615384615385', 'History/4.405594405594406', 'Urbanization/1.7142857142857142']","['Arts', 'History', 'Urbanization']",10.858341658341658,"['Society/17.644530632765928', 'Cultural/11.660520361990953', 'Individual_Personal/11.121592442645076']","['Society', 'Cultural', 'Individual_Personal']",40.42664343740196,"['Politics/8.377777777777778', 'Arts/5.867760180995475', 'History/4.347619047619047']","['Politics', 'Arts', 'History']",18.5931570063923,0.6666666666666666,0.6666666666666666
Shimon Minamikawa,"The painting Index (Tokyo) includes an image of a protest march in Japan. There is some humor in this image and also cultural contextual confusion and displacement, embodied in the painting. The protest we can see on the clipping is against two things : 1)recently the Japanese government revised the constitution (some say illegally) so that the right to collective self-defense is possible; this basically re-militarizes Japan ending decades of pacifism and this sparked the largest public protests in recent years and 2) the protestors are also marching against re-starting nuclear power plants in Japan post-Fukushima.","Since the beginning of his career, Minamikawa Shimon has made work that deviates from conventional painting and other formats. From portraits made with pale tones to abstract paintings using brilliant fluorescent colors, and a series called Sign Boards, in which he applies paint directly to an easel, Minamikawa’s works assume a variety of forms. And by showing a number of works with different qualities alongside each other, the artist rearranges the meaning of each individual piece, and turns the space into a work of art. In recent years, Minamikawa has collaborated with performance artists as Ei Arakawa and others, and produced works that traverse artistic genres.",Index (Tokyo),Asia,"['protest.n.01', 'japan.n.01', 'plant.n.01', 'japanese.a.01', 'government.n.01', 'public.a.01', 'image.n.01', 'power.n.01', 'cultural.a.01']","['protest.n.01', 'wit.n.01', 'supplanting.n.01', 'meaning.n.01', 'dislocation.n.01', 'japan.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_MS-PA-15-07-WEB.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_MS-PA-15-07-WEB-199x300.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/index-tokyo/,"['Politics/3.675', 'Individual_Personal/2.577777777777778', 'Material_Physical/2.3619909502262444']","['Politics', 'Individual_Personal', 'Material_Physical']",8.614768728004023,"['Activism/1.875', 'Emotion/1.8', 'Fantasy/1.6']","['Activism', 'Emotion', 'Fantasy']",5.275,"['Politics/6.186655011655011', 'Cultural/5.030769230769231', 'Individual_Personal/4.852747252747252']","['Politics', 'Cultural', 'Individual_Personal']",16.070171495171493,"['Power/3.3116550116550116', 'Culture/3.3076923076923075', 'Mind/2.3956043956043955']","['Power', 'Culture', 'Mind']",9.014951714951716,0.6666666666666666,0.0
Yuki Kimura,"Kastura (2012) is an installation consisting of 24 black-and-white photographs of the Katsura Imperial Villa in Kyoto bequeathed by Kimura’s grandfather; free-standing structures on which they are hung; and ornamental plants. The photographs appear to have been taken in late 1950s soon after tours of the villa were first offered to the public. Then, as today, visitors were led by a guide and could only follow a designated route. Cross-referencing the numbers inscribed on the back of the 24 photos and the locations where they were shot, Kimura found that sequence of photos elegantly encapsulates the entire tour route. This prompted her to create an installation employing the complete set of photos. Since German architect Bruno Taut lauded the Katsura Imperial Villa in the early 20th century as the apotheosis of the Japanese aesthetic, its building have frequently appeared in discussions of modernist architecture. Noting that the centuries-old villa and works of modernist architecture share the structural concept of the module, Kimura devised a group of spare steel modular units, on which the photographs are hung to create seamlessly integrated objects. In this work, Kimura replicates a time and place captured on film around half a century earlier.","Focusing on the temporal and spatial layers inherent in the medium of photography, Yuki Kimura constructs relationships between photographs and exhibition spaces that imbue the act of viewing with new dynamism.",Kastura,Asia,"['photograph.n.01', 'architecture.n.01', 'century.n.01', 'make.v.03', 'populace.n.01', 'visitor.n.01', 'shoot.v.01', 'late.a.01', 'plant.n.01', 'aesthetic.a.01', 'sequence.n.01', 'japanese.a.01', 'location.n.01', 'concept.n.01', 'set.n.01', 'structure.n.01', 'building.n.01', 'object.n.01', 'movie.n.01', 'time.n.01']","['replica.n.01', 'temporal_role.n.01', 'past.n.01', 'animate.v.04', 'memory.n.01', 'time.n.01', 'topographic_point.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_YK_IN_1209_016_72dpi_1200px.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_YK_IN_1209_016_72dpi_1200px-300x196.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/kastura/,"['Material_Physical/7.684493284493285', 'Cultural/7.2848541980894925', 'Individual_Personal/3.3956043956043955']","['Material_Physical', 'Cultural', 'Individual_Personal']",18.36495187818717,"['Time/5.258119658119658', 'Mind/2.5384615384615383', 'Culture/2.307692307692308']","['Time', 'Mind', 'Culture']",10.104273504273504,"['Cultural/30.682426560367748', 'Material_Physical/14.042612942612948', 'Society/13.104029304029305']","['Cultural', 'Material_Physical', 'Society']",57.829068807009996,"['Arts/15.427650290885587', 'Media/6.568803418803419', 'Design/5.578280542986425']","['Arts', 'Media', 'Design']",27.574734252675434,0.6666666666666666,0.0
Nguyen Trinh Thi,"Landscape Series no. 1 presents landscape as a “quiet witness of history.” It began with searches of online archives of Vietnamese news-media, for images of figures in landscapes “pointing, to indicate a past event, the location of something gone, something lost or missing.” The uniformity is striking but the sequence is subtly structured: the typology hints at narrative progression, though of an uninformative narrative, lacking details.","Nguyen Trinh Thi is a Vietnamese artist, filmmaker and founder of a documentary video organisation in Hanoi.

Diana Fonseca Quiñones,"In Los amantes (The lovers) Diana Fonseca Quiñones uses simple, commonplace objects and experiences that she derives from daily life to develop narratives that mix reality and fiction.

Elad Lassry,"The black-and-white photograph Men (055, 065) (2012) depicts two similarly built young men – young and slim, with dark tousled hair and a square jaw line – seated aside one another in identical outfits. It is unclear if these subjects are related, despite the obvious doubling of visual cues, and Lassry offers few hints to suggest that these men have any association beyond their sitting for the same picture. By extension, Lassry subverts conventions in portrait photography by identifying his subjects with numbers, erasing the familiarity inherent in the act of naming, Men (055, 065) functions as an anti-portrait in which anonymity supplants intimacy. In establishing a deliberate distance between viewer and subject, Lassry raises questions about representation itself and how all portraits are, in effect, fully constructed objects that only gain meaning once we ascribe them with our own personal associations and emotions.","Elad Lassry explores how visual languages are constructed across multiple disciplines and media. His larger body of work responds to the relationship between artistic mediums and their forms, and his prints question familiar modes of viewership and our continuous desire to find and identify clear narratives in photographs. Lassry utilizes both found photographs and original compositions in his work, a juxtaposition that challenges notions of authorship and attribution. By emphasizing how photographic images are deliberately staged and constructed, Lassry destabilizes notions that photographs depict and document “the real.” In foregrounding the image as object, he also suggest that the photograph only provides a referent for a presence that “has-been” but that no longer exists in the current moment. Born in Israel, Lassry earned his BFA in film from the California Institute of Arts in 2003 and his MFA from the University of Southern California in 2007.","Men (055, 065)",Americas,"['association.n.01', 'construct.v.01', 'portrayal.n.01', 'hair.n.01', 'dark.n.01', 'capable.s.02', 'distance.n.01', 'function.n.01', 'picture.n.01', 'personal.a.01', 'photography.n.01', 'representation.n.01', 'ocular.a.02', 'question.n.01', 'spectator.n.01', 'object.n.01', 'photograph.n.01']","['portrayal.n.01', 'association.n.01', 'representation.n.01', 'anonymous.a.01', 'familiarity.n.03', 'equivocal.a.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_Elad-Lassry_Men_WEB.png,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_Elad-Lassry_Men_WEB-238x300.png,https://kadist.org/work/men-055-065/,"['Individual_Personal/12.774358974358979', 'Cultural/5.895604395604395', 'Society/3.3956043956043955']","['Individual_Personal', 'Cultural', 'Society']",22.065567765567767,"['Mind/4.9282051282051285', 'Culture/3.269230769230769', 'Spirituality/3.076923076923077']","['Mind', 'Culture', 'Spirituality']",11.274358974358975,"['Cultural/16.353757130382515', 'Individual_Personal/14.441025641025647', 'Material_Physical/3.8461538461538467']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Material_Physical']",34.640936617562005,"['Arts/5.2973684210526315', 'Mind/4.9282051282051285', 'Media/3.635897435897436']","['Arts', 'Mind', 'Media']",13.861470985155195,0.6666666666666666,0.3333333333333333

Hong-Kai Wang,"The video Music While We Work (2011) is the first part/work of a long-term research project started in 2010. The project revolves around and beyond the history of sugar in the small town Huwei in central Taiwan (the artist’s hometown). The town was nicknamed as the “Capital of Sugar” during the Japanese colonial ruling (1895-1945) of Taiwan. Yet, the history of this small town and its pivotal role in the deadly Taiwanese anti-colonial resistance movement is not known or talked about. In 1925, a gathering of sugar planters led up to the historical yet today largely unknown revolt, even unknown among the workers’ generations after the revolt. For this work she assembled a group of retired workers from a Taiwanese sugar refinery in the small industrial town of her childhood (first or second generations of workers after the 1925 revolt). She and her collaborator, the political activist and composer Chen Bo-Wei (Taiwanese, born 1971), led a series of recording workshops for the retirees and their spouses. They then returned to the factory, where Wang asked them to “paint a world composed by their listening.” The video installation is both an account of their collective learning process and the resulting compositions.","Wang is an artist working primarily with sound. Her work investigates ‘listening’ as a conceptual tool to explore social relations and the (re)construction of cultural memory in marginal spaces.

Aaron Young,"The artist describes the work as “very performative video-pieces but they take on a more sculptural feel. The action is simple: I kick a video camera through a site that is embedded with sociological elements, which I try to question through my practice. I chose Red Square as the site to work in Moscow. The square is interesting as a kind of high/low, new/old dichotomy of a new capitalist regime, with the most expensive World-brands of fashion, design and architecture creeping in like a drug that everyone is forced to take but hasn’t been tested long enough to know the effects. All of this is in direct opposition to an almost outdated value system represented by Lenin’s tomb across the road. After summing up this pyramid of power and history, having it laid out in a square where there can be a final point… me as an American here performing a very minimal, radical action of kicking a camera over time within those parameters. The camera breaks down within three to four minutes, creating a time-based situation: the image that is being recorded disappears kick after kick and visually erases all the embedded history, the politics… the finished work lends itself to a social/cultural amnesia that I find exists in this place.”","Aaron Young’s artworks rely on the aftereffects of dynamic, energetic, and sometimes even dangerous performances. He hires participants stereotyped as marginalized rebels, such as skateboarders and motorcycle riders, to perform various stunts in exhibition spaces on specially prepared platforms—such as the performance Arc Light for the exhibition, for what you are about to receive. Like Steven Parrino, Young uses destructive actions as generative force; the traces of his ephemeral acts are recorded as videos, drawings, sculptures, and photographs to constitute artistic artifacts.",Never Leave Home Without It,Americas,"['square.n.01', 'camera.n.01', 'action.n.01', 'american.n.01', 'history.n.01', 'represent.v.01', 'direct.a.01', 'concluding.s.01', 'effects.n.01', 'resistance.n.01', 'sculptural.a.01', 'design.n.01', 'architecture.n.01', 'government.n.01', 'simple.a.01', 'situation.n.01', 'elements.n.01', 'power.n.01', 'manner.n.01', 'practice.n.01', 'time.n.01', 'video.n.01']","['capitalism.n.01', 'amnesia.n.01', 'russia.n.04', 'history.n.01', 'sociology.n.01', 'value.n.06', 'political_orientation.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_Aaron-Young_Never-Leave-Home-Without-It-WEB.png,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_Aaron-Young_Never-Leave-Home-Without-It-WEB-300x230.png,https://kadist.org/work/never-leave-home-without-it/,"['Individual_Personal/9.54331908201877', 'Material_Physical/9.166047024870554', 'Society/8.526704014939309']","['Individual_Personal', 'Material_Physical', 'Society']",27.236070121828636,"['Values/4.563398692810458', 'Land/4.333146591970122', 'Mind/3.3799203892083147']","['Values', 'Land', 'Mind']",12.276465673988895,"['Cultural/23.776301802772398', 'Politics/20.909487734487737', 'Society/20.659085685556278']","['Cultural', 'Politics', 'Society']",65.34487522281641,"['Arts/9.002400703871293', 'Power/8.3995670995671', 'Time/5.858541458541458']","['Arts', 'Power', 'Time']",23.260509261979855,0.3333333333333333,0.0
Sergio De La Torre,"Nuevo Dragon City is a reenactment of a historical event from 1927 in which six Chinese were either trapped or voluntarily hid themselves inside a building in northern Mexico.

Alexandre Arrechea,"White Corner (2006) is a video installation, projected on two protruding perpendicular walls. On one level the work constitutes a self-portrait of the artist, whose image is projected on both walls, separated by the corner. Yet while facing, they don’t quite confront each other. The projection on the left hand presents Arrechea wielding a machete, while on the right he holds a baseball bat. Together, the artist appears to be unwittingly attacking himself, a poignant comment on blind fear and the failure to recognize the similarity in the “otherness.”","Alexandre Arrechea was born in 1970 in Trinidad, Cuba, and graduated from the Instituto Superior de Arte in Havana in 1994. In the early 1990s he was known as a member of the art collective Los Carpinteros, which he left in 2003 in order to pursue his career as a solo artist.  Since then, his works have often explored the growing prominence of surveillance systems in contemporary society and the fragility, loss of privacy, and disempowerment that result from this obsession with control. Recently, Arrechea’s interest in the limits of the artwork itself has led to his creation of interdisciplinary works in public spaces.",White Corner,Unspecified,"['wall.n.01', 'white.n.01', 'fear.n.01', 'projection.n.01', 'degree.n.01', 'hand.n.01', 'video.n.01', 'image.n.01']","['otherness.n.01', 'self.n.01', 'attack.n.05', 'self-portrait.n.01', 'weapon.n.01', 'fear.v.02']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/alexandre_arrechea_white_corner.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/alexandre_arrechea_white_corner-224x300.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/white-corner/,"['Cultural/4.758169934640523', 'Society/2.7705627705627704', 'Politics/2.611111111111111']","['Cultural', 'Society', 'Politics']",10.139843816314404,"['Technology/3.980392156862745', 'Inequality/2.611111111111111', 'Violence/1.7705627705627704']","['Technology', 'Inequality', 'Violence']",8.362066038536627,"['Individual_Personal/17.019500107735407', 'Society/4.2263736263736265', 'Material_Physical/4.083516483516483']","['Individual_Personal', 'Society', 'Material_Physical']",25.329390217625516,"['Emotion/10.543223443223445', 'Mind/3.2191338073691016', 'Violence/2.6263736263736264']","['Emotion', 'Mind', 'Violence']",16.388730876966175,0.3333333333333333,0.3333333333333333
Tomoko Yoneda,"Yoneda’s Japanese House (2010) series of photographs depicts buildings constructed in Taiwan during the period of Japanese occupation, between 1895 and 1945. Yoneda focuses both on the original Japanese features of the houses and on details that have been altered since the end of the occupation. The yet-to-be acknowledged history of the occupation of Taiwan and other East Asian countries by Japan during World War II is subtly disclosed in these pictures. Instead of presenting monuments, the artist chooses to depict houses where the domestic lives of local Taiwanese are still unfolding today. The complexity of history is thus foregrounded by the overlapping of the everyday, the memory mixing with the remains. Former Residence of the Daughter of the Japanese Prime Minister, Kentaro Suzuki, Who Accepted the Potsdam Declaration and Full Surrender to the Allied Powers, Ending the Second World War, Qingtian Street, I depicts a dusty room with Japanese window frames but no views. Its title offers a biography of the original inhabitants and their historical role before the postwar Chinese Nationalist takeover. The wall behind the counter in Former House of General Wang Shu-ming, the Chief of Staff Under Chiang Kai-Shek, Cidong Street, I has been painted a deep red. The detailed title subtly suggests how local residents may have subsequently altered the home’s original paint colors to be more “Chinese.”","Photography is Tomoko Yoneda’s primary medium. Influenced by both journalism and archaeology, the London-based artist tries to minimize subjectivity in her work and keep her subjects as real and open as possible, leaving space for interpretation by the viewer. Often the sites she documents appears insignificant and nondescript, lacking any visual references that might trigger direct associations with historical events. Their lengthy titles, however, reveal the identities of the places by providing historical and political context. The haunted feeling generated by the emptiness of the locations evokes unsettled spirits of the past, and seems to invite a moment’s reflection.",Japanese House Series,Asia,"['japanese.a.01', 'occupation.n.01', 'house.n.01', 'original.s.01', 'change.v.01', 'local.a.01', 'street.n.01', 'war.n.01', 'title.n.01', 'east.n.01', 'japan.n.01', 'complexity.n.01', 'chinese.a.01', 'history.n.01', 'memorial.n.03', 'picture.v.02', 'feature.n.01', 'details.n.01', 'paint.n.01', 'picture.n.01', 'colors.n.01', 'time_period.n.01', 'frame.n.01', 'building.n.01', 'state.n.04']","['occupation.n.02', 'claustrophobia.n.01', 'memory.n.01', 'architecture.n.01', 'war.n.01', 'haunted.s.03']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/tomoko_yoneda_former_house_of_general_wang_shu-ming.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/tomoko_yoneda_former_house_of_general_wang_shu-ming-300x234.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/japanese-house-series/,"['Society/8.616711229946524', 'Cultural/6.729298642533936', 'Individual_Personal/3.3956043956043955']","['Society', 'Cultural', 'Individual_Personal']",18.741614268084856,"['War/3.625', 'Arts/2.6985294117647056', 'Mind/2.5384615384615383']","['War', 'Arts', 'Mind']",8.861990950226243,"['Cultural/25.168496372908145', 'Society/23.597821786057086', 'Individual_Personal/16.610304727951792']","['Cultural', 'Society', 'Individual_Personal']",65.37662288691703,"['Arts/12.736990950226245', 'History/8.473926073926075', 'Familial/6.664985994397758']","['Arts', 'History', 'Familial']",27.875903018550076,1.0,0.3333333333333333

Sun Xun,"Sun’s animated film 21 Ke (21 Grams) is based on the 1907 research by the American physician Dr. Duncan MacDougall who claimed the measured weight of the human soul to be twenty-one grams. Sun used this episode—which was not fully recognized by the scientific community—as a point of departure for his depiction of a dystopian world in which the narration of history and notion of time are interrupted. Because each frame was drawn by hand with crayon, it took Sun and his animation studio team a few years to complete this thirty-minute film of a surreal journey through mysterious cities, plagues of mosquitoes, broken statues, cawing ravens, waving flags, and flooded graveyards. Here, an ever-present man in a top hat makes obscure, cryptic references in scenarios that include the national anthem, factories belching soot into the threatening sky, and soaring planes dropping leaflets to earth. Rather than encouraging specific interpretations, 21 Ke is a visual commentary that asks essential questions of human existence: Who we are? What have we done? Where are we heading?","Sun Xun creates videos and animation films from his meticulous, highly detailed, and often monochromatic, hand drawings executed in ink, oil, and crayon. Drawing on the ideas of thinkers like Karl Marx, Theodor Adorno, and Max Horkheimer, Sun investigates revolution, existence, mythologies of society, the notion of time, and the construction and narration of history. Often in a style of magical realism, Sun’s works are full of metaphors and indirect visual associations that beg to be deciphered. He graduated from the print making department of the China Academy of Fine Art in 2005, and, a year later, established ? Animation Studio.

Kan Xuan,"In four-channel video Island, a series of objects such as nail clippers, hairbrush, toothpaste, and house decorations are displayed with close-up shoots. Images are rendered in a highly polished and aesthetic manner, creating poetic visual ?ows. In front of each object, however, lies a coin, ranging from 2 Yuan, to 1 Pound, to 1 Euro or 1 Dollar, silently revealing the material value of these household supplies. Underneath elegant surface there is a deep sense of critical irony, elaborating by the contradictory nature of the cheap plastic items and their sophistic visual interpretation. Kan poignantly and metaphorically comments on the economic and production structure of today’s global market. The most in?uential visual spectacles can be generated by the most basic elements in the everyday.","Experimenting with painting, photography, performance, and video installation, Kan Xuan explores the everyday from a very personal perspective. Though she graduated from the China Academy of Fine Art with rigorous training in oil painting, Kan quickly adopted video as her primary medium. From often ignored daily life experiences as points of departure, Kan creates a visual diary. Here, the camera amplifies mundane activities to reveal absurd and eerie details. For example, in Kan Xuan, Ai!, she calls and answers her own name among the crowd in subway station; in Eggs, she squeezes and breaks eggs with her hands, and in A Sunny Day two middle-aged men laugh and tickle each other in a public plaza.

Gabriel Orozco,"Darth Vader (2014) makes overt references to pop cultural antecedents, specifically George Lucas’ blockbuster film Star Wars (1977). The image depicted however seems to have little in common with Lucas’s space epic: the photograph, instead, shows an umbrella laid upside down on the ground, filled almost to the brim with a tear-drop shaped pool of water. The highly reflective surface of the water reflects the umbrella’s handle and armature as well as the trees and cloud-streaked sky overhead. It is not entirely clear why Orzoco chooses to gesture towards Star Wars here – possibly because the water’s reflective surface echoes the shape and high-polish helmet of Star Wars’ primary antagonist, Darth Vader. But in documenting a seemingly amusing and interesting “everyday” phenomena, Orzoco again gestures towards how everyday objects and environments can function as readymade art works. In this context, the water’s mirrored surface can also be read as a metonym for infinity and the amorphous possibilities that exist in our every day world. Floating elegantly in the upturned umbrella, the pool of water becomes a literal site for reflection, turning our perceptions back unto ourselves.","Gabriel Orozco could be described as a traveler-artist, without a fixed studio. He works following contexts and produces work that flows. “Special Service” (1997) is a collage on a plane ticket, and indicates nomadism, between territories. The artist, who is the son of muralist Mario Orozco Riviera, questions the boundaries of his artistic identity in Mexico. In “Crazy tourist” (1991), Orozco creates a situation with oranges in the Brazilian market tables in a desert. The artist uses objects or “poor” situations, found in the everyday landscape, natural or urban. By their division, their juxtaposition, or collage, inventing semantic or sensitive scenarios, always surprising, sometimes humorous and sometimes lyrical … The sculptural practice of the artist, inseparable from his drawings, photographs, or films, invents relationships of space, and disrupts our perception of objects.

Shahab Fotouhi,"Shahab Fotouhi’s photographic series Establishing Shot; Interior, Night – Exterior, Day; without Antagonist and Extra consists of four C-prints that at first glance would appear to be travel posters for Iran, in that each features a beautifully shot image of an Iranian waterfall. Upon closer inspection, one will find the superimposition over the photographs of a script that looks like code. The text is actually a transcription of a political debate that occurred between two 2009 Iranian presidential campaign candidates, but with all the words removed, leaving only the punctuation. Fotouhi satirizes the debate itself, pointing out the words exchanged to be essentially meaningless, and potentially revealing a “watershed” moment in Iranian history.","Shahab Fotouhi uses sculpture, video and photography to present moments of suspension, merging the playful and the serious.

Elad Lassry,"In establishing a deliberate distance between viewer and subject, Lassry raises questions about representation itself and how all portraits are, in effect, fully constructed objects that only gain meaning once we ascribe them with our own personal associations and emotions. An example of this is Floor, Legs (2013), a gelatin silver print in which a large black rectangle obscures the upper half of a candid photograph with two figures that are ultimately only identifiable by their legs and feet, which are even then indiscernibly crossed and posed beyond easy recognition. Even though its unclear if Lassry’s source image is a found photograph or an original composition, the underlying themes – of the photograph’s function as an object, and the impossibility of discerning “the real” through its representation – continue to resonate.","Elad Lassry explores how visual languages are constructed across multiple disciplines and media. His larger body of work responds to the relationship between artistic mediums and their forms, and his prints question familiar modes of viewership and our continuous desire to find and identify clear narratives in photographs. Lassry utilizes both found photographs and original compositions in his work, a juxtaposition that challenges notions of authorship and attribution. By emphasizing how photographic images are deliberately staged and constructed, Lassry destabilizes notions that photographs depict and document “the real.” In foregrounding the image as object, he also suggest that the photograph only provides a referent for a presence that “has-been” but that no longer exists in the current moment. Born in Israel, Lassry earned his BFA in film from the California Institute of Arts in 2003 and his MFA from the University of Southern California in 2007.","Floor, Legs",Americas,"['representation.n.01', 'photograph.n.01', 'object.n.01', 'capable.s.02', 'distance.n.01', 'association.n.01', 'function.n.01', 'floor.n.01', 'original.s.01', 'personal.a.01', 'beginning.n.04', 'real.a.01', 'composition.n.01', 'construct.v.01', 'portrayal.n.01', 'black.a.01', 'subject.n.01', 'figure.n.01', 'question.n.01', 'spectator.n.01', 'image.n.01']","['representation.n.02', 'portrayal.n.01', 'fiction.n.01', 'stage.v.01', 'world.n.03', 'photography.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_Elad-Lassry_Floor-Legs.png,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_Elad-Lassry_Floor-Legs-300x237.png,https://kadist.org/work/floor-legs/,"['Cultural/21.333357432041648', 'Individual_Personal/4.094133807369101', 'Society/0.7692307692307693']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Society']",26.19672200864152,"['Arts/7.64553691922113', 'Fantasy/5.491666666666667', 'Media/3.369230769230769']","['Arts', 'Fantasy', 'Media']",16.506434355118564,"['Individual_Personal/17.604884004884013', 'Cultural/15.750996552467145', 'Material_Physical/6.250915750915751']","['Individual_Personal', 'Cultural', 'Material_Physical']",39.60679630826691,"['Mind/7.323809523809524', 'Culture/5.5769230769230775', 'Materiality/3.6373626373626373']","['Mind', 'Culture', 'Materiality']",16.53809523809524,0.6666666666666666,0.0
Li Binyuan,"Freedom Farming presents how, after being given the right of farming, Li Binyuan began to re-dig his land. He attempted to physically open a space for conversation with the generation of his parents. On the second day, villagers that were gathering in the field, including his mother, started to watch a strange event: Li Binyuan’ s 2-hour long jumping and falling in his land until he finally stopped, exhausted. He jumped up to escape from the earth (his hometown), but being unable to overcome the gravity (his birth), heavily fell back onto the ground. This repetitive attempt to leave, and the invariant result of falling back every time, somehow gave him a kind of cardiac injury. And he suffered a physically heart-aching pain for some time. At this juncture, only by acting directly and painfully, he had finally accomplished his process of mourning of his father death, his hometown, and his farming situation.","Beijing-based artist Li Binyuan explores physicality, chance, play and social values through actions, film works and performances that intervene in the social fabric of everyday Chinese society. His experiments occupy urban spaces, from the very public arena of the street, to remote post-industrial sites. Using his body as a sculptural material to enact creative investigation, he uses ruptures and repetition to manifest how sculpture and performance can intertwine. Rearticulating social conduct while interrogating our experiences of the everyday, Li is sometimes running naked through the streets, crashing into trees and using hammers to destroy other hammers.

Akira Takayama,"In Akira Takayama’s work Happy Island – The Messianic Banquet of the Righteous, five video screens perpendicular to the floor feature footage of cows grazing and resting in the rolling hills of a farmland. Renamed ‘The Farm of Hope’ by owner Masami Yoshizawa, the property is located 14 kilometers away from the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant, and is part of a now restricted area that became highly contaminated with radiation after an earthquake and tsunami caused leaks from the plant in 2011.  Most of the livestock in the restricted areas have either starved to death after being abandoned by their owners or have suffered from the effects of radiation. The remaining neglected cows in Fuku (happy) Shima (island) are no longer cows, but rather radioactive waste. In an act of defiance towards authorities and generosity towards the affected animals, Yoshizawa moved back to his home inside a now desolate landscape to continue caring for his cattle despite the fact that he can no longer benefit from selling the cows. Although Yoshizawa’s cows are safe from slaughter and free from the burden of labor, they are also doomed by radiation. Caught in this bind, Takayama’s work captures these cows in a permanent limbo—left behind like the thousands of evacuees that continue to reside in temporary housing in northeast Japan after the nuclear disaster.","Akira Takayama is a Japanese theater director known for creating projects that challenge the conventional framework of theater. In 2002 he founded Port B, a network of artists, intellectuals, performers and activists working collaboratively with the aim to reimagine the discipline of theatre and its relationship to society. Far from performing to a passive audience from the safety of the stage, the collective engages directly with the public and urban spaces through site-specific installations, performances, sightseeing tours and other experimental projects, which require the audience’s participation. Whether through video interviews with residents, oral history audio recordings or Mp3 guided walking tours of specific areas, Takayama’s productions often use digital and social media as means to raise awareness and foster empathy towards various histories and marginalized groups: either the thousands displaced by a nuclear disaster in Fukushima, the Muslim communities discriminated against in Japan, or the rising number of refugees and homeless struggling in Tokyo. At the core of his practice is a desire to expand on the ‘architecture of theater’ and to establish it as a new platform in society—which he calls Theater 2.0—that is able to respond to pressing social issues.",Happy Island - The Messianic Banquet of the Righteous,Asia,"['island.n.01', 'plant.n.01', 'japan.n.01', 'locate.v.01', 'animal.n.01', 'feature.n.01', 'footage.n.01', 'effects.n.01', 'floor.n.01', 'screen.n.01', 'government.n.01', 'death.n.01', 'power.n.01', 'landscape.n.01', 'video.n.01']","['abandon.v.01', 'radiation.n.01', 'doomed.n.01', 'defiance.n.01', 'nuclear.a.01', 'farmland.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_cow_1-WEB.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_cow_1-WEB-300x169.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/happy-island-the-messianic-banquet-of-the-righteous/,"['Material_Physical/5.917105263157895', 'Politics/1.6', 'Society/0.8']","['Material_Physical', 'Politics', 'Society']",8.317105263157895,"['Land/4.275', 'Immaterial/0.8421052631578947', 'Politics/0.8']","['Land', 'Immaterial', 'Politics']",5.917105263157895,"['Material_Physical/9.573382173382173', 'Individual_Personal/5.792760180995474', 'Society/5.658119658119658']","['Material_Physical', 'Individual_Personal', 'Society']",21.024262012497303,"['Power/4.111655011655012', 'Materiality/3.3802197802197798', 'Land/1.9230769230769231']","['Power', 'Materiality', 'Land']",9.414951714951714,0.6666666666666666,0.3333333333333333
Aki Kondo,"Hikari (Light) (2015) depicts a fantastical and wrenching story about Juneko, a terminally ill young woman who communicates with her lover, a painter, through a portrait of her produced shortly after her death. As Juneko becomes sicker, her hair begins to fall out, a symptom of her unnamed illness. As her condition deteriorates, the film toggles back and forth with the animated story of Mogeji, a white strand of hair inhabiting Juneko’s body who becomes anthropomorphized through Kondo’s animation and recounts his own story of mortality and loss. Although its love story is unabashedly sentimental, Hikari (Light) also responds to the aftermath of the 2011 Tohoku earthquake in Japan and the national trauma it subsequently triggered. Reframed in this context, Juneko’s illness draws more unsettling allusions to the radiation poisoning experience by citizens living near nuclear reactors damaged during the earthquake and subsequent tsunami. Throughout, the animated interludes function as their own counter narrative depicting that, despite its elements of the fantastic, metaphorically depicts a body in crisis. Hauntingly complex, Hiraki (Light) offers a powerful meditation on loss, disease, and the inexorable necessity for hope amidst trauma.","Aki Kondo utilizes animation, video, and mixed media to explore such varied topics as intimacy, loss, and the human body. Her work crosses multiple practices and frequently investigates the creative process as an object of study in and of itself, exploring how artistic mediums can communicate emotionally complicated narrative through expressive and resonant images.

Hank Willis Thomas,"The image is borrowed from protests during Civil Rights where African Americans in the south would carry signs with the same message to assert their rights against segregation and racism. Historically, in countries such as the US and South Africa, the term “boy” was used as a pejorative and racist insult towards men of color, slaves in particular, signifying their alleged subservient status as being less than men. In response, Am I Not A Man And A Brother? became a catchphrase used by British and American abolitionists. The question “Am I Not A Man?” was brought up again during the Dred Scott decision of the U.S. Supreme Court in 1857. More recently, “I Am a Man” and also “I Am Not a Man” has been used as a title for books, plays and in film to assert the rights of all people to be treated with dignity, from African Americans to Feminists. Signs were even used in Arabic language translated to Ana Rajul during the Arab Spring.  For this painting, the artist was specifically inspired by a particular photograph from the 1968 Memphis Sanitation Strike, where a large group of black men assembled with protest posters bearing the same message and nearly identical typeface. The artist has also created many other version of this painting that play with the orientation and wording of the text (ie: A Man I Am, I Be a Man, I Am Many, I Am The Man, etc.), reflecting historically on the variations that have been used before, and speculating on how they may continue in the future. Of this series the artist recalls:“I was born in 1976, and I was amazed that just eight years before I was born it was necessary for people to hold up signs affirming their humanity. The phrase that I grew up with was “I am the man,” which is also influenced by African-American culture but takes a very different starting point. What I was interested in was, how many other ways could I read that phrase?… In the U.S. Constitution, blacks were considered three-fifths of a man. Then there was the slogan adopted by the Quakers, “Am I not a man and a brother?” There are a lot of other references, like “Ain’t I a Woman?” is a reference to Sojourner Truth’s famous speech, but also the Women’s Liberation movement. The final painting in the group says “I am. Amen.” The greatest revelation should be that we are.”","Employing the visual language and terminology of mass media, and appropriating symbols and images from popular culture, Hank Willis Thomas’ work seeks to question and subvert established definitions and positions with regards to personal identity and the narrative of race. Working across installation, photography, video, and media work, Thomas maintains his photo conceptualist roots, primarily taking source material from found photographs and archives. These images form the basis from which the artist seeks to uncover the fallacies that history claims as truth.

Engel Leonardo,"As with so many other colonized geographies, the ways in which violence has become a natural and expected component of Santo Domingo reflects the forced friendship between the beneficiaries and residues of Modernism. What distinguishes these two communities? What separates them? Bars, naturally. In this untitled work, Engel cages everyday household items in steel bars as a metaphor for this condition. Only those who have something valuable to protect can afford such restrictive barring systems, which are viewed almost as status symbols. Even when they are unnecessary, their ubiquity creates a sinister picture of success. Not only does the proliferation of these bars negate their own visibility, but it also points to a paranoid future where everything one owns becomes “embellished” as something to be seen but not used.","Working with various mediums, from sculpture to installation, site-specific interventions, and readymades, Leonardo Engel addresses issues related to the climate, nature, traditional crafts, architecture, and popular culture of the Caribbean.

Enrique Ramirez,"In Un Hombre que Camina (A Man Walking) (2011-2014), the sense of rhythm and timing is overpowered by the colossal sense of timelessness of this peculiar place. Shot in Uyuni, Bolivia, the film depcits world’s largest salt flat, a site that sits in a mountainous region at over twelve thousand feet above sea level. Ramirez’s work is deeply invested in the loss of regional identity, and the anachronistic dress of his “modern-day shaman” in the film is meant to reconcile the historical and cultural gaps between tribal traditions of a specific time and place and the all-too-prevalent homogeneity brought on by advanced capitalism. His festive yet ominous ceremonial mask, by extension, functions as a relic of colonial resistance: made by native coal miners to ward off Spanish invaders, the mask signals a need both past and present to preserve rituals passed down through future generations and across cultural genealogies.","Enrique Ramirez produces media and photography-based work that explores the interrelationship between landscape and “subjective imaginary.” Born in Santiago, Chile, during dictator Augusto Pinochet’s violent rule, Ramirez’s highly politicized practice questions notions of exile, displacement, loss of memory and a changing sense of place. Growing up with a sail-maker father, his process often returns to the sea as a backdrop for his investigations of geo-politics. Open spaces and vast landscapes prevalent in his seductive films and installations serve as breathing room for contemplation and imagination. A sense of longing and nostalgia often haunts his works as Ramirez engages both personal recollections and gathered stories of loss and deracination. He has exhibited his work at international venues such as the Palais de Tokyo, Paris; Loop Fair, Spain; and Museo Amparo, Mexico. He received his BA in Film Studies from Instituto de Artes y Communicacion ARCOS, Chile and a Master in Contemporary Art from the Studio National des Arts Contemporains in France.",Un hombre que camina (A Man Walking),Americas,"['mask.n.01', 'sense.n.01', 'cultural.a.01', 'sea.n.01', 'rhythm.n.01', 'loss.n.01', 'region.n.01', 'native.a.01', 'bring.v.01', 'movie.n.01', 'coevals.n.01', 'specific.a.01', 'resistance.n.01', 'function.n.01', 'degree.n.01', 'shooting.n.01', 'tradition.n.01', 'historical.a.01', 'identity.n.01', 'contemporary.s.01', 'time.n.01']","['homogeneity.n.02', 'colonialism.n.01', 'decolonize.v.01', 'identity.n.01', 'ritual.n.01', 'culture.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/enrique_ramirez_un_hombre_que_camina_1.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/enrique_ramirez_un_hombre_que_camina_1-300x168.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/hombre-camina/,"['Society/9.293493091016312', 'Individual_Personal/4.797979797979798', 'Cultural/2.6013071895424837']","['Society', 'Individual_Personal', 'Cultural']",16.692780078538593,"['Identity/4.797979797979798', 'Culture/2.6013071895424837', 'History/2.6013071895424837']","['Identity', 'Culture', 'History']",10.000594177064764,"['Individual_Personal/17.41409701409702', 'Cultural/16.53620268620269', 'Material_Physical/10.381618381618383']","['Individual_Personal', 'Cultural', 'Material_Physical']",44.33191808191809,"['Culture/5.102564102564103', 'Media/4.930341880341881', 'Identity/4.797979797979798']","['Culture', 'Media', 'Identity']",14.830885780885781,0.6666666666666666,0.6666666666666666
Fang Lu,"In the work Cinema, Fang Lu explores in a meticulous yet un-dramatic — almost casual — way of how “the self” in our today’s life is a controlled and staged construction of oneself. What appears at first sight to be a not unusual performance of self-choreography, becomes at a second glance a disturbing portrait of a – female – persona brought to life under contemporary conditions of attractiveness, anxiety and narcissism. Unlike her previous works, which duel more on the internal, surrealistic human conditions, this seven-channel work elevates the individual relationship with its socio-political environment to a more recognizable and appealing set of behavioral actions of self-awareness and self-inflicted anguish. Cinema, as a “portrait”, is staged in the fashion of creating a self-image in the politically guarded societal arena of surveillance and social networks. In this media oriented process of constructing a self-image, one experiences over time the loss of one’s, authentic, identity. In that sense Cinema is a “melancholic” portrait.","Lu Fang grew up in a family of Chinese ink painters. Reacting to her upbringing upon exposure to video art, Lu decided to pursue art education in the United States in graphic design and new genres. Fang’s practice consists of video works that explore the way media and performance impact love and human relationships in desolate, insular environments such as deserts or abandoned museums. She often creates site-specific situations where she directs her actors to perform certain tasks or speak on a given theme, paying particular attention to female voice and subjectivity. Furthermore, the staging of her camera work zooms in on the way contemporary media dictate narrative creation that shifts incessantly between the domestic and the exotic, quotidian and supernatural.",Cinema,Asia,"['film.n.02', 'portrayal.n.01', 'social.a.01', 'surveillance.n.01', 'female.a.01', 'loss.n.01', 'glance.n.01', 'network.n.01', 'life.n.01', 'set.n.01', 'construction.n.01', 'individual.a.01', 'environment.n.01', 'action.n.01', 'relationship.n.01', 'identity.n.01', 'contemporary.s.01', 'sense.n.01', 'medium.n.01', 'performance.n.01', 'manner.n.01', 'human.a.01', 'procedure.n.01', 'time.n.01']","['self.n.01', 'portrayal.n.01', 'anxiety.n.01', 'self-love.n.02', 'surveillance.n.01', 'melancholy.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/fang_lu_cinema_2013_7_channels_video_installation_sound_color_16to9_1.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/fang_lu_cinema_2013_7_channels_video_installation_sound_color_16to9_1-300x200.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/cinema/,"['Individual_Personal/12.512454212454214', 'Politics/3.3076923076923075', 'Society/3.173382173382173']","['Individual_Personal', 'Politics', 'Society']",18.993528693528695,"['Emotion/10.743223443223444', 'Power/2.307692307692308', 'Violence/1.6263736263736264']","['Emotion', 'Power', 'Violence']",14.677289377289378,"['Cultural/39.5723371399842', 'Individual_Personal/17.27783327783328', 'Society/17.08766788766789']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Society']",73.93783830548537,"['Media/14.064772319184083', 'Arts/12.520721108956407', 'Technology/5.810897435897436']","['Media', 'Arts', 'Technology']",32.396390864037926,0.6666666666666666,0.0

Hank Willis Thomas,"Thomas’ lenticular text-based works require viewers to shift positions as they view them in order to fully absorb their content. Meaning, therefore, changes depending on one’s perspective—and in the case of Thomas’ installation, only emerges when one knows that there is always something hidden, always more to one of his works than immediately meets the eye. This lenticular print with text shifts as you walk in front of it from its title, “Black Imitates White” to the inverse, “White Imitates Black”(and some other possibilities in between) emphasizing that there are always at least two perspectives to the same scenario, and thereby encouraging us as viewers to consider them all together rather than trying to identify with any one subjectivity.","Employing the visual language and terminology of mass media, and appropriating symbols and images from popular culture, Hank Willis Thomas’ work seeks to question and subvert established definitions and positions with regards to personal identity and the narrative of race. Working across installation, photography, video, and media work, Thomas maintains his photo conceptualist roots, primarily taking source material from found photographs and archives.

Jean-Luc Moulène,,"After training in literature and working in advertising, Jean-Luc Moulène became known in the 1990s for his ‘documentary’ photographic practice. His images could be considered as studies of natural and cultural phenomena; the Objets de grève ( Strike objects) series (1999) documents objects made in factories during social protests. Moulène uses the codes of media images and diverts them to liberate the gaze and produce a new imaginary. This poetic tactic is manifest in the series called Disjonctions, in which Moulène photographs still lives, portraits, daily urban scenes. The notion of disjunction, which can be interpreted in the grammatical sense (‘or’, ‘either… either…’) or in terms of logic (an alternative in a dilemma), is manifest in the image by the disunity of the elements in the composition. The artist is not just a photographer, he increasingly creates relations with drawing, sculpture, objects, texts and newspapers. As a counterpoint, when asked what unites his work, the artist responds that: “An absurd evidence, a horrible revelation,a burst of laughter…” (Interview with Briony Fer, « Chaque quelconque », ibidem.)

Joachim Koester,"Physical and mental exploration have been founding elements in Joachim Koester’s research for several years. While exploration was mainly a matter of geography during the 19th century, the 20th century brought the mental exploration of our unconscious, triggered by the discovery of psychoanalysis. Koester is interested in documenting minor events, forgotten by History, in order to reintroduce them into collective memory. Using 16mm documentary films, photographic series or books, his work transforms stories into images and vice versa, appearing as a quest for the invisible and the vanishing.","With a keen interest in the stranger corners of the long human story, and a persistent interest in the supernatural, the transcendent, and the psychedelic, Joachim Koester’s work follows the artists own undying interest in physical and psychological limits. While exploration was  a matter of crossing geographies before the 19th century, the 20th century brought the mental exploration of our unconscious, hastened by the discovery of psychoanalysis. Koester is interested in visualizing specific events—those forgotten, overlooked, or suppressed by the official historical record—in order to reintroduce them into collective memory.

Maaike Schoorel,,"Based on photographs and domestic environments, Maaike Schoorel’s paintings are charged with an atmosphere of melancholy and loss. In her paintings images emerge slowly. Her figurative paintings appear faded or bleached with brush strokes that suggest outlines and restrained marks that imply areas of colour or shadow. The viewer must participate in the paintings, employing a particular way of looking that allows the images to unravel slowly over time. The spaces they provide are not only physical, but also conceptual – the freedom to find pleasure in their beauty, or to find consolation in the way in which they transform memory from an image of yesterday into a fresh, present-day experience.",Maaike and John,Europe,[],"['memory.n.01', 'melancholy.n.01', 'loss.n.01', 'aeriform.s.02', 'dreamlike.s.01', 'percept.n.01', 'emotion.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_Maaike-Schoorel_Maaike-and-John_01_WEB.png,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_Maaike-Schoorel_Maaike-and-John_01_WEB-223x300.png,https://kadist.org/work/maaike-and-john/,"['Individual_Personal/16.67728937728938', 'Cultural/9.061538461538463', 'Material_Physical/5.571428571428571']","['Individual_Personal', 'Cultural', 'Material_Physical']",31.310256410256414,"['Emotion/8.886080586080586', 'Mind/5.934065934065934', 'Culture/4.615384615384616']","['Emotion', 'Mind', 'Culture']",19.435531135531136,[],[],0.0,[],[],0.0,,

AES+F,"The Last Riot was originally created for Venice Biennale in 2007. In reference to Baroque Painting tradition and Chiaroscuro, this video installation imagines a dystopian virtual world where bodies removed from conscience and emotion exist weightlessly in a cyber paradigm. Light, shadow and digital manipulation slate a post-apocalyptic world where young teens enact conflict as ritual. Both heroes and villains here are automatons here, mechanically carrying out unseen commands within this dreamlike simulation.  The letters AES+F of the Russian Collective are for its four members, Tatiana Arzamasova, Lev Evzovich, Evgeny Svyatsky and Vladimir Fridkes. Originally the collective was founded in 1987 with Fridkes joining in 1995, adding his experience as fashion photographer to the mix. Bringing together their individual extensive expertise ranging from conceptual architecture, set design, puppetry, film, photography, graphic design and image making, the group has held over one hundred solo exhibitions, and has showcased their works in Biennials ranging from Venice in 2007 to Gwangju, Helsinki, Istanbul, Lyon & others.

Himali Singh Soin,"Developed especially for the KADIST-KHOJ collaborative exhibition, Frozen World of the Familiar Stranger, Radar Level is set in the world’s last geological minutes, in two ancient landscapes. One in the northern hemisphere in Mongolia at the site of the first dinosaur egg excavation and the other beneath the southern constellation of Nambia, on its old waters. Embedded within the work are a series of dualities and codes. For example, the title and duration of the work are palindromes, indicating a play and blurring between notions of past and future, forward and backward. The split projection reverses between desert and water, as one channel moves back in time, the other moves forward, until they meet and change directions. Dissolving in these images are found photographs of humans in spacesuits before the space age, gearing up for the end of life, for a distant voyage, for protection or for colonial imitation. Just as the title itself is a palindrome, here, the extinction of the past looks like the extinction of the future. The sound is a combination of dinosaur sounds and outer space vibrations, both anterior to human existence, yet only known through anthropocentric, technological re-imaginings. The text, recited by the artist, is a poetic reflection on the experience of human discovery and isolation.","Himali Singh Soin is an artist and writer whose work is inspired by poetry and  planetariness. Her performances reflect on deep outer space as a place of inferences,  entanglements, accelerating voids, debris, delays, irrational law, alienation and infinite  mystery.

Adrian Villar Rojas,"Adrián Villar Rojas is known for his large-scale, site-specific sculptural installations that transform their environs into a vision of a new potential future. Much of his work imagines the end of human civilization and of his own life, and he constructs his monuments in anticipation of that inevitability.

His works combine the daunting scale of conventional public sculptures with a precarious fragility, keeping viewers mindful of the ephemerality of even the most imposing monoliths, both resisting decay and celebrating it.","Adrian Villar Rojas’s sculptures and drawings envision the end of human civilization.

Gregory Crewdson,"Gregory Crewdson works within a photographic tradition that combines the documentary style of William Eggleston and Walker Evans with the dream-like vision of filmmakers such as Stephen Spielberg and David Lynch. Crewdson’s method is equally filmic, building elaborate sets to take pictures of extraordinary detail and narrative portent. When he was ten, Crewdson’s father, a psychoanalyst, took him to see a Diane Arbus exhibition at MoMA, an early aesthetic experience that informed his decision to become a photographer. Crewdson’s everyday scenes with charged, surreal moods hint at the longings and malaise of suburban America. The artist uses “the limitations of a photograph in terms of narrative capacity to have an image that is frozen in time, where there’s no before or after” and has turned that restriction into a unique strength.","Gregory Crewdson works within a photographic tradition that combines the documentary style of William Eggleston and Walker Evans with the dream-like vision of filmmakers such as Stephen Spielberg and David Lynch.

Jordan Kantor,"Lens Flare and the series Untitled Basel Lens Flare (6168, 5950, 7497) were part of a solo project by the artist presented at ArtBasel in 2009. Included in the Kadist Collection, these works continue to explore the ontology of the image to investigate the relationship between painting, photography, and a new time-based variable: film. Reduced here to the essential function of recording the exposure of light through the apparatus of a lens, Kantor then translated these film stills into painted colored canvases that retain the 3:4 aspect ratio of the 16mm film as well as the exact size of the projected image. The resulting paintings depict the “lens flares” in the film—the fleeting reflective glare inside the camera apparatus that results from when its lens is pointed directly at a bright light source.",Jordan Kantor’s artworks explore relationships between painting and photographic mediums.

William E. Jones,"In Restaurant, Canton, Ohio (2011), a convenience store offers food, liquor, and Coca Cola to an empty street. A series of boarded-up storefronts marred by peeling paint conveys a sense of the pre- or post-apocalyptic—the hush just before or after a disaster. The reds, pinks, and oranges of the buildings give off warmth, but the absence of human activity makes the glow eerie and strange. Once a booming steel town, Canton is now struggling, and many of its buildings have been neglected for decades.

William E. Jones,"In the early 20th century, the Hercules Engine Company was doing a brisk business producing customized, heavy-duty engines. Seventy years later, when the United States military started opting for Humvees and stock parts, the company began to fail, and it entirely ceased production in 1999. Hercules Engines, Abandoned, Canton, Ohio (2011) depicts the manufacturer’s former productive core, gone fallow. A sapling has grown up in the loading dock, and a view straight through the industrial interior shows a field on the other side.

Jones appropriated and edited, in a rapid sequence, a selection from the more than 68,000 censored or discarded films produced by the Farm Security Administration’s photographers between 1935 and 1943. Roy Emerson Stryker, the then director of the program, was in charge of what he called “killing” negatives by punching holes in them to render them unusable. Killed continues Jones’s use of discarded film footage seen in his video created from vintage 1970s and 1980s gay porn that was included in the 2008 Whitney Biennial.

Abraham Cruzvillegas,"Wright Imperial Hotel (2004) is a sort of bow and arrow made out of feathers, a São Paulo phone book, and other materials. The title is a reference to a building Frank Lloyd Wright designed for Tokyo, which was completed in 1923. In its heyday, which lasted until after World War II, the hotel was reserved for elite personnel, many of them foreigners. With the passage of time it came to be seen as outdated and dingy, and it was demolished in the 1960s. Cruzvillegas’s work ironically and humorously symbolizes the hotel imposing presence. He presents us with the ultimate symbol of democracy—a phonebook—pierced with arrows. The sculpture is a symbol of solidarity imperiled by imperialism.","Abraham Cruzvillegas is known for his intricate and elaborate sculptures and installations made from found and scavenged materials.

Daniel Joseph Martinez,,"For more than three decades, the Los Angeles–based artist Daniel Joseph Martinez has used every art medium at his disposal to investigate raw aspects of American culture, dipping adeptly into derangements of body and brain, individual and society. In one well-known piece that he produced for the 1993 Whitney Biennial, he replaced the text on the museum’s admission ticket with the phrase “I Can’t Ever Imagine Wanting to Be White.” Visitors held the sentiment in their hands and kept it in their pockets. In The House America Built (2004), he re-created in exacting detail the cabin in which the Unabomber penned his manifesto. While Martinez’s concepts are tight and concise, they leave ample space to implicate the viewer. His work prompts more than finger pointing; it catalyzes introspection, signaling the necessity of taking stock of one’s own role in perpetuating difficult yet ubiquitous images.","If Only God Had Invented Coca Cola Sooner!

Wadada Leo Smith,"Kosmic Music is a musical score comprised of two parts: a single mixed media drawing titled Colors and Satellites, and a pair of mixed media drawings titled Koral Reef. Conceived of together as a single musical score, the three drawings exemplify a specific stage in the evolution of Wadada Leo Smith’s Ankhrasmation Language, which he has been developing since 1967.  Although at first glance the works in Kosmic Music might appear abstract compositions drawn on paper, as with other scores produced by Smith, suggestions of musical structures are revealed upon closer inspection: an entanglement of musical sheets and bright geometric forms.  The artist activates these works by performing the scores live, sometimes accompanied by other musicians who are familiar with his Ankhrasmation Language and can follow the cues from the formal and musical components of the works. As described by Smith: “the scores are constructed in a way that can be used to produce music, but the music itself is not on the score. The score is this doorway where you become aware of elements like structure, shapes, color and [the] connection of those shapes and colors and lines and dots. You have to transform that into some kind of reference, [and] then you’re able to actually get to the music.”","Wadada Leo Smith is an avant-garde jazz musician, composer, educator and visual artist, celebrated for his creative and unconventional approach to music.  Over the past 50 years, a focal point of his practice has involved the ongoing research and development of his own musical language, which he calls Ankhrasmation: a neologism formed from the terms ‘Ankh,’ the Egyptian symbol for life, ‘Ras,’ the Ethiopian word for leader, and ‘Ma,’ a universal term for mother. This language is characterized by musical scores that avoid (and at times, incorporate) traditional notationsin favor of symbolic compositions of color, line, and shape. Improvisational elements of jazz are woven into Smith’s colorful pieces, some of the scores taking up to several days to perform. These vibrant constructions are filled with energy and mystery, providing creative guidance for the seasoned improviser while allowing musicians to bring their own expertise and strengths to their performance.",Kosmic Music,Americas,"['mark.n.01', 'music.n.01', 'colors.n.01', 'produce.v.01', 'individual.a.01', 'language.n.01', 'structure.n.01', 'shape.n.01', 'medium.n.01', 'drawing.n.01', 'transform.v.01', 'glance.n.01', 'sheet.n.01', 'pull.v.01', 'pair.n.01', 'component.n.01', 'uncover.v.01', 'familiar.a.01', 'phase.n.01', 'specific.a.01', 'connection.n.01', 'formal.a.01', 'line.n.01', 'abstract.a.01', 'color.n.01']","['music.n.01', 'language.n.01', 'drawing.n.01', 'geometric.s.01', 'performance.n.01', 'structure.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_21432-01-WEB.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_21432-01-WEB-233x300.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/kosmic-music/,"['Cultural/15.247496947496952', 'Society/5.051282051282051', 'Individual_Personal/0.8571428571428571']","['Cultural', 'Society', 'Individual_Personal']",21.15592185592186,"['Arts/8.743223443223442', 'Economy/2.371794871794872', 'Design/2.307692307692308']","['Arts', 'Economy', 'Design']",13.422710622710623,"['Cultural/27.899570853982627', 'Society/8.31196581196581', 'Individual_Personal/8.04807153630683']","['Cultural', 'Society', 'Individual_Personal']",44.259608202255265,"['Arts/9.445787545787546', 'Media/7.531108597285066', 'Design/4.931221719457014']","['Arts', 'Media', 'Design']",21.908117862529625,1.0,0.6666666666666666
Laura Huertas Millán,"La libertad is a “greca” film, a meander film, with no beginning nor end, weaving together fragments of daily life at the Navarro´s, counting threads and time, wondering and wandering around words as emancipation, labor, and freedom (la libertad), the word that most appeared in our conversations. The “greca”, the meander, is the main symbol weaved in the textiles made by the Navarro sisters, from Santo Tomás Jalieza, México. A geometrical form of an endless braid of diamonds, the “greca” represents corn, an entity worshiped by the pre-hispanic civilisations of Mesoamerica. La greca stands for sustenance, but materialises as well the feminine power of producing abundance and fertility – the textiles displaying this ongoing motives could be read as invocations for life and growth.  In the Navarro’s textiles, animals, objects and spaces are represented. Their fabrics are made in the backstrap loom, a prehispanic technique preserved by indigenous women for centuries. Through textiles, women have built the archives of a parallel history of Mexico’s crosscultural relationships, “mestizaje”, colonialism and modernity. Echoing the politics and ethics represented in the objects they weave, the Navarro have built an ecological and familiar micro society, longing for independence.","Laura Huertas Millán was born in Bogota, Colombia, and has been living in France since 2001. Her films and expanded cinema works consider aesthetics and politics through a range of narratives and formats. In 2009 she started a series of works around the notion of exoticism, shot between European tropical gardens and the Colombian Amazon, inspired by the poignant documents tracing the human zoos in France in the early XXth century, cultural anthropophagy (as expressed by Oswald de Andrade in 1928) and explorer´s journeys accounts in America. The films of this exoticism series built dialectics between ethnography and colonialism, proposing hybrid narratives with no hierarchy between genres as science-fiction, surrealism, fantasy and documentary. Since 2012, Huertas Millán has been engaged in a practise-based PhD film research on “ethnographic fictions”, developing this paradoxical and ambiguous idea in a new series.",La libertad,Americas,"['fabric.n.01', 'represent.v.01', 'construct.v.01', 'woman.n.01', 'object.n.01', 'ongoing.s.01', 'read.v.01', 'mexico.n.01', 'movie.n.01', 'life.n.01', 'fragment.n.01', 'familiar.a.01', 'conversation.n.01', 'animal.n.01', 'politics.n.01', 'technique.n.01', 'daily.s.01', 'symbol.n.01', 'century.n.01', 'society.n.01', 'relationship.n.01', 'power.n.01', 'history.n.01', 'space.n.01', 'form.n.01']","['fabric.n.01', 'labor.n.02', 'feminine.n.01', 'everyday.s.01', 'domestic.a.02', 'feminism.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_lalibertad-WEB.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_lalibertad-WEB-300x169.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/la-libertad/,"['Cultural/9.631674208144798', 'Individual_Personal/8.298529411764704', 'Society/6.51025641025641']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Society']",24.440460030165912,"['Economy/4.171794871794872', 'Design/3.1312217194570136', 'Arts/2.5384615384615383']","['Economy', 'Design', 'Arts']",9.841478129713424,"['Cultural/16.22423687423688', 'Material_Physical/14.531538052590687', 'Society/10.813675213675216']","['Cultural', 'Material_Physical', 'Society']",41.56945014050278,"['Arts/5.195604395604396', 'Materiality/5.069230769230769', 'Media/4.866239316239316']","['Arts', 'Materiality', 'Media']",15.131074481074481,0.6666666666666666,0.3333333333333333
Richard T. Walker,"let this be us is a single-channel video by Richard T. Walker featuring the artist himself roaming around the wilderness of a deserted landscape, sporadically humming a melody, strumming a guitar, or playing a few notes on a keyboard. As he traverses between striking locations we see him carrying large photographic prints of the same landscape that he is treading, which he then rests onto tripods so that the horizon in the photograph seamlessly matches that of the real landscape. As we hear the music, Walker comes in and out of view, dissipating into the landscape as his body becomes invisible, hidden behind the photographic prints. The sublime mountain peaks, as the artist explains, only exist in the distance, and our experience of them is different when we are up-close. In that sense they are unattainable, and always in the distance… a beautiful analogy of human longing and desire.","Richard T. Walker seeks out sublime landscapes, devoid of human intervention—often with vast skies punctuated by mountains—and transforms them into intimate settings to compose performative videos, with layered soundtracks. The videos are often presented with sculptures, instruments and images, that collectively speak (or sing) of the relationship between a single human life and the limitless expanse of the natural world. Originally from the U.K., Walker moved to California in 2007, drawn by the striking landscape of American West. Akin to 18th century Romantic figures such as Caspar David Friedrich, for Walker the sublime landscape is an arena in which he can explore strong human emotions and existential ideas: from the perception of the self and others, through to human solitude and our relationship to nature.",let this be us,Americas,"['print.n.01', 'landscape.n.01', 'photographic.a.01', 'mountain.n.01', 'note.n.01', 'invisible.a.01', 'distance.n.01', 'music.n.01', 'location.n.01', 'desire.n.01', 'real.a.01', 'sense.n.01', 'position.n.03', 'human.a.01', 'experience.n.01', 'body.n.01', 'photograph.n.01', 'video.n.01']","['solitude.n.02', 'romanticism.n.02', 'empyreal.s.02', 'music.n.01', 'landscape.n.01', 'percept.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_Richard-T-Walker_1-carrying-crator-on-rock-WEB.jpeg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_Richard-T-Walker_1-carrying-crator-on-rock-WEB-300x169.jpeg,https://kadist.org/work/let-this-be-us/,"['Cultural/14.265428276573793', 'Individual_Personal/5.904376325428957', 'Material_Physical/3.5142857142857142']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Material_Physical']",23.68409031628846,"['Arts/6.1984864121087035', 'Mind/4.062271062271062', 'Culture/3.076923076923077']","['Arts', 'Mind', 'Culture']",13.337680551302842,"['Material_Physical/17.194536019536024', 'Individual_Personal/15.697857697857703', 'Cultural/10.899622926093516']","['Material_Physical', 'Individual_Personal', 'Cultural']",43.792016643487244,"['Emotion/12.381618381618384', 'Space/8.923931623931624', 'Land/4.2']","['Emotion', 'Space', 'Land']",25.50555000555001,1.0,0.0
Liu Chuang,"Categorized as low-level literature, a “Love Stories” book is a romantic popular fiction of proletariat China, read mainly by teenagers, students, and young workers. These novels were mostly written by Taiwanese and Hong Kong writers in the 1980s to the 1990s to meet the cultural needs of the new social classes before being imported into China after the Chinese economic reform in the late 1980s. As contemporary China industry developed, a large number of workers became readers of this new pulp fiction. Artist Liu Chuan purchased about 20,000 Love Stories books from a run-down book rental shop in the booming industrial Dongguan, a factory city located in the Pearl River Delta where he used to live and where most of the working population were migrating to from around the country. Here Love Story only presents about 3,000 used pulp fiction novels rented or borrowed by migrant workers, and the anonymous handwritten notes accumulated within them. Some notes look like letter drafts or rather internal monologues while other appear as diaries or poems. Love Story can be seen as a portrait of a generation of migrant workers in China, from 1990 to 2010, an important transitional period in China both economically and politically.","Known for engaging socio-economic matters as they relate to urban realities, Liu Chuang proposes different understandings of social systems underlying the everyday. Through grim humor and often poetic approach, Liu Chuang often works with ready-mades and interventions across various mediums from video, installation, architecture to performance. Liu Chuang works have integrated social intervention with institutional critique to examine China’s immediate realities, particularly the Shanzhai phenomenon of piracy and plagiarism in mass manufacturing and culture.",Love Story,Asia,"['love.n.01', 'china.n.01', 'worker.n.01', 'fiction.n.01', 'note.n.01', 'book.n.01', 'narrative.n.01', 'factory.n.01', 'shop.n.01', 'population.n.01', 'river.n.01', 'chinese.a.01', 'anonymous.a.01', 'late.a.01', 'locate.v.01', 'coevals.n.01', 'writer.n.01', 'class.n.01', 'write.v.01', 'popular.a.01', 'economic.a.01', 'time_period.n.01', 'state.n.04', 'portrayal.n.01', 'contemporary.s.01']","['migrant.n.01', 'labor.n.01', 'proletarian.n.01', 'love.n.01', 'society.n.01', 'literature.n.03']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_LIU-CHUANG_LOVESTORY_SALON94NYC-WEB.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_LIU-CHUANG_LOVESTORY_SALON94NYC-WEB-300x200.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/love-story/,"['Individual_Personal/12.552747252747254', 'Society/6.264218237902448', 'Cultural/5.743589743589744']","['Individual_Personal', 'Society', 'Cultural']",24.560555234239445,"['Emotion/10.686080586080587', 'Violence/2.4835164835164836', 'Language/2.307692307692308']","['Emotion', 'Violence', 'Language']",15.47728937728938,"['Individual_Personal/20.0701714951715', 'Cultural/17.18924698489916', 'Material_Physical/12.082295628348259']","['Individual_Personal', 'Cultural', 'Material_Physical']",49.34171410841893,"['Emotion/11.486080586080588', 'Fantasy/7.400757575757576', 'Land/6.219883040935673']","['Emotion', 'Fantasy', 'Land']",25.106721202773837,0.6666666666666666,0.3333333333333333
Jiri Kovanda,"Untitled (1992) responds to the same principles of an economy of means as the artist’s actions and installations: three empty cardboard boxes which have contained photographic film are piled one on top of the other. Nevertheless there is a harmony in the assembly of forms, writing, colors, proportions; an aesthetic construction is carried by this contemporary still life. This work charts the passing of time: the cardboard yellows, the film becomes obsolete in the digital age. In a meta-artistic dimension, this sculpture could be a manifesto for Kovanda’s work.

Danh Vo,"The work “Les Fleurs d’intérieur” (which gives its name to the exhibiton presented at Kadist Art Foundation from May 30 to July 13, 2009) is a brass plate engraved with the inventory list of the works included in the show. From this moment, Dahn Vo will use this brass plates as a systematic element for all his exhibitions.","Danh Vo’s personal history of migration and adjustment is an important reference point for his artistic practice. In his work, he explores themes ranging from identity, authorship, sexuality, and ownership to origin. He uses intimate, personal material to show that identity is a construction of projections, assumptions and attributed values. Vo embarks upon a subtle investigation of the Western fascination for the exotic and unknown with an exquisite conceptual style. For Vo, appropriating the history of others is a way of unraveling monolithic ideas about identity. And he does so with great verve, generally initiating the journey with himself. In addition to his classifiable works, a certain mystified aura lingers around his actions: the artist has married, and subsequently divorced numerous people simply to add their names to his list, he has committed “crimes” later displaying their documentation as show, for example. In his installations he uses objects, photos and documentation that connects his family history to real memories intertwined with a complex imaginary. His refugee status has led him to attempt to reconstruct various derivations of identities, origins, and stories. This requires the questioning of social structures, the endorsement of different identities, the questioning of values, and the undermining of conventions in order set forth a groundwork for his personal depiction in the world of society at large.  Born in 1975, Danh Vo is a Danish artist with Vietnamese origins.

Keren Cytter,"“Untitled” is inspired by the movie “Opening Night” by John Cassavetes with Gena Rowlands playing the role of a fallen woman, anguished by her distressed life. In the film, we witness the drama of a blended family, heightened by adultery and finally murder. For the film’s decor, Cytter, instead of filming a domestic interior, uses a theater stage, a place of representation by excellence. Dialogues, accessories and camera movements disrupt the boundary between the stage and the “behind the scenes” acts which are in fact staged. While its difficult to distinguish the stage’s front and back, also it is difficult to determine the improvised and real. Like her other films, reality is constructed and artificial, but the theatrical element complicates our relationship to her characters. Are the actors in a scene or subjects of their own life? In “Untitled,” the artist merges theatricality on stage and in life finally offering a permanent performance.","Keren Cytter makes films who appropriate and transform different registers, from film noir, melodrama, documentary and television series.  Although visually close to amateur filmmaking, the film’s dialogues adopt complex structures of multiple degrees as well as non-linear narratives. Keren Cytter is interested in human behavior and modes of communication. Often shot in modest interiors, her films depict dysfunctional families and friendships on the verge of breakdown. In the words of her former teacher, Marlene Dumas, when commenting on Cytter’s dark humor,”it is not a funny hahaha humor, nor a sour humor. It is humor as an insult. It comes from a cruelty, a keen intelligence mixed with extreme emotional vulnerability and an acute awareness of one’s own stupidity and inability to understand one another. “Keren Cytter was born in 1977 in Tel Aviv.

Kitty Kraus,"This work emphasises Kitty Kraus’s involvement with process, with alchemical transformations associated with Post-Minimalist aesthetics, Arte Povera, Joseph Beuys and Robert Smithson. The loss of form or its dissolution is at the heart of the series of lamps encapsulated in blocs of ice with liquid progressively spreading on the floor. The bulb is embedded in the ice. The cubic form is compact, minimal and resembles an explosive device. Once the lamp is switched on, the ice melts inevitably. The color black spreads on the floor to form an abstract landscape. It is as if we are confronted with a common mechanical accident but the realization has a very precise protocol. She makes wooden boxes with silicone which are filled with water that enables the moulding of the form. Electric lights are often present in works of the second half of the 20th century to refer to daily objects (Rauschenberg, the Nouveaux Réalistes) or to transcendental aspirations (Dan Flavin, Mario Merz). Here we are faced with a sombre beauty that destroys the object, the form and metaphysical aspirations while creating a changing form that is close to black dripping covering the ground.","Kitty Krauss has a very particular outlook on Minimal and Constructivist Art. She reinterprets certain historical forms by highlighting their sensitive dimension. She uses glass, ice, light, mirrors in works that toy with the tension between formal perfection and extreme fragility. References can be found to sculptures by Richard Serra but also by Joseph Beuys or Dan Flavin. She questions the Modernist myths, the aesthetic preconceptions of the art of the 1960s. The materials she uses are intentionally chosen to evoke the fragility and impermanence of things. Kitty Krauss was born in Heidelberg, Germany in 1976.

Kitty Kraus,"Composed of two rectilinear pieces of glass, this work is part of a series of sculptures started in 2006. These transparent assemblages are in contact with the walls and floor of the exhibition space. The sculptures of this series are the same dimensions with different combinations. A large glass plaque associated with a smaller one recur to suggest the proportions of a human body. The glass plaques are joined simply with adhesive tape. The gaze must distinguish these in space, bodies need to work around them. The work plays on the tension between elements that are controlled (dimensions, balance) and those that are uncontrollable. These minimalist, transparent and perfect forms are nevertheless sharp enough to endanger the skin surface. The works in this series recall the large steel plaques by Richard Serra if only because they entirely integrate the possible collapse of the form.","Kitty Krauss has a very particular outlook on Minimal and Constructivist Art.

Tracey Rose,"“Maqe II” is at first glance a romantic image of three diaphanous angels hovering in the luminous sky over a South African township. A closer inspection reveals that the apparition is the appropriated figure of Marie Antoinette from the artist’s Ciao Bella series (2001) with the addition of a butchered cake. The figure is Rose herself dressed in costumed made of trash bags holding a haunting paper mâché mask. The figure floating above a crossing of two sharp metal traffic barriers and the triple-exposed view of tract houses piled upon one another in a Reconstruction and Development Programme (RDP) settlement evokes an eerie sense of both past and forthcoming catastrophes. The photograph, in conversation to the women referenced in the Ciao Bella Series, adroitly confronts the audience with the legacies of sexual, racial and political oppression. Rose successfully achieves this without tending towards self-conscious sentimentality. Whether the appropriated Marie Antoinette acts as a monarch of the RDP settlement or a symbol of a social system responsible for massive poverty and displacement, “Maqe II” is a significant contribution to the canon in its sophisticated reflection of contemporaneous identity.","Tracey Rose, (b. Durban, South Africa, 1974) is a multimodal performance artist employing photography and video in her subversive oeuvre that traverses post-colonial theory, gender, race and contemporary identity. The artist is known internationally for her interpretations of masterpieces of the western tradition—most notably for her appropriation of Leonardo da Vinci in Ciao Bella (2001) at the 49th Venice Biennale. While the artist has often been touted as offensive in her political directness, Rose’s work contributes to the creation of a contemporary canon of art history, one that is significantly perceptive in the acuteness of identity in the decolonizing process.",Maqe II,Middle East & Africa,"['figure.n.01', 'mask.n.01', 'african.a.01', 'sky.n.01', 'glance.n.01', 'conversation.n.01', 'development.n.01', 'audience.n.01', 'symbol.n.01', 'contemplation.n.02', 'house.n.01', 'series.n.01', 'paper.n.01', 'woman.n.01', 'identity.n.01', 'sense.n.01', 'position.n.03', 'political.a.01', 'social.a.01', 'photograph.n.01', 'image.n.01']","['race.n.03', 'stereotype.n.01', 'racism.n.01', 'colonialism.n.01', 'inequality.n.01', 'identity.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/fiche-Tracey-Rose.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/fiche-Tracey-Rose-300x296.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/maqe/,"['Individual_Personal/9.050727050727053', 'Politics/7.137377758120792', 'Society/4.959565580618212']","['Individual_Personal', 'Politics', 'Society']",21.147670389466057,"['Inequality/7.137377758120792', 'Identity/5.7979797979797985', 'Culture/3.0854700854700856']","['Inequality', 'Identity', 'Culture']",16.020827641570676,"['Cultural/17.191674605064705', 'Individual_Personal/13.226970355066332', 'Society/10.588786213786214']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Society']",41.007431173917254,"['Arts/5.786990950226245', 'Identity/5.575757575757575', 'Mind/4.217972816657027']","['Arts', 'Identity', 'Mind']",15.580721342640846,0.6666666666666666,0.3333333333333333
Ei Arakawa and Sergei Tcherepnin,"Part of a series entitled “Looking at Listening”, 2011, the piece invited the spectator to experiment and consider sound as a kinetic and synesthetic process, where multiple experiences and senses can cross. The presented photographs were selected from the New York Public Library and found in an archive called ‘Listening,’ with the sub-genres ‘town meetings,’ ‘investigation,’ ‘audiences 1960–1970’ and ‘conversation.’ Taking the photographs from the city’s archive of frozen moments of audio exchange, Arakawa and Tcherepnin give sound and movement back to past moments. In each of the photographs, people are listening in different situations—public, and private. Transposed from recorded events to archival status, then from facsimile inks to copper and reflective aluminum, these moments are then connected to a sound device playing Tcherepnin’s compositions that have been recorded in previous performances in New York and Tokyo. The artist’s replace the original auditory fundamentals of each of these images and create a new meaning to the images. The work is activated by the public and thus transformed into a sound sculpture. Invited to manipulate the metal plates as instruments, deafening the metal with fabric or whirling them around, the visitors create sound ripples, dissolving the visible aspects of the work to give form to listening.","Ei Arakawa (b. 1977, Fukushima, Japan) and Sergei Tcherepnin (b. 1981, Boston, Massachusetts), both currently based in New York, began their audio-visual and performative collaboration in 2007. The two artist’s kinetic and synesthetic performance, composition and installation works explore the materiality of sound. Ei Arakawa has initiated and participated in numerous performances and collective experiences. Most of his projects give rise to new collaborations with artists, musicians and poets. Whatever form takes of the installation, whether a festival or event, in appearing as an improvised performance, Arakawa and Tcherepnin’s work is always participative and joyfully chaotic.",Looking at Listening: Insights from the Forest,Americas,"['new_york.n.01', 'york.n.01', 'moment.n.01', 'sound.n.01', 'photograph.n.01', 'populace.n.01', 'brooding.s.01', 'transform.v.01', 'status.n.01', 'probe.n.01', 'visitor.n.01', 'town.n.01', 'private.a.01', 'conversation.n.01', 'exchange.n.01', 'multiple.a.01', 'aspect.n.01', 'fabric.n.01', 'audience.n.01', 'visible.a.01', 'name.v.01', 'original.s.01', 'composition.n.01', 'event.n.01', 'public.a.01']","['sense.n.03', 'memory.n.01', 'memory.n.02', 'percept.n.01', 'sound.n.01', 'sight.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/ea_sc_1112_001_72dpi_1200px.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/ea_sc_1112_001_72dpi_1200px-248x300.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/looking-at-listening/,"['Cultural/9.661538461538463', 'Individual_Personal/8.666208791208792', 'Material_Physical/4.571428571428571']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Material_Physical']",22.899175824175828,"['Mind/5.934065934065934', 'Culture/5.415384615384616', 'Time/2.857142857142857']","['Mind', 'Culture', 'Time']",14.206593406593408,"['Cultural/16.916930618401214', 'Society/16.444761980365698', 'Material_Physical/8.813725490196079']","['Cultural', 'Society', 'Material_Physical']",42.175418088962985,"['Urbanization/8.381514117117831', 'Land/5.580392156862745', 'Arts/4.213461538461539']","['Urbanization', 'Land', 'Arts']",18.175367812442115,0.6666666666666666,0.0
Gabriel Pericas,"“Weight & velocity (cat on router)” is a duo of two humorous photographs of a cat lying on a computer router. The weight of the cat that voluptuously outspreads on the router contrasts with the speed of the information circulating in the object—the two subjects are opposing in their essential existence. In a pragmatic way, the cat stretches on the router for the heat that emerges. The heat produced by the material allows the circulation of immaterial information. “Weight & velocity (cat on router)” is not just an image of a cat–– it is a visual encompassment of domesticity and warmth in contrast with the coldness of networks and technology.","Gabriel Pericàs (b. 1988, Palma de Mallorca, Spain) is interested in developing an ironic view of modernity and its many forms through manipulating design processes. Referencing the work of Duchamp, Richter and Baldessari, Pericàs writes texts that are staged into performances, in which certain of his already existing art pieces are actors. The artist is interested in situating the viewer in a space that is built between narration and formalism employing a variety of digressions and slips to question methods of communication.

Zanele Muholi,"As a visual activist for the rights of Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer and intersex (LBGTQI), Muholi’s photographs radically transgress the conventional perception of lesbian and transgender communities in South Africa. Members of the LBGTQI community who suffer from continuous attacks — “corrective” and “curative rapes”, physical and psychological assaults, and hate crimes — Muholi works from her own community to create strong and positive images of empowered individuals. As visual statements, her photographs seek to dignify the members of an often hidden, voiceless and marginalized community. The verticality and scale of the prints accentuate the resilience of the figures, confronting the viewers with their scrutinizing and empowered gaze. The photographs support and promote self-expression, pride and autonomy in the face of an oppressive social system to reshape and reclaim an authoritative black lesbian and transgender presence in the global landscape. Presenting the black and white photographs as first-person testimonies of homophobia, discrimination and violence of LBGTQI black women, the “Brave Beauties” series thus acts as a conscription to autonomy and a visual activation of equal recognition.","Zanele Muholi (b.

Elham Rokni,"“The Wedding” is the centerpiece of a series of works centered on a film of the artist’s parents’ wedding in 1978, the year before the Iranian revolution that gave power to a religious fundamentalist regime. Struggling to remember the details and the date of the event, Rokni’s relatives inadvertently embellish and recreate the excitement, confusion, and eventual disappointment of those historic months in Iran. The uncertainty about the wedding date seems to mirror the confusion of the historic turmoil about to sweep Iran. The video appropriates segments of the 2012 Hollywood film Argo—in which a CIA agent attempts to rescue six Americans held hostage in Tehran—to visualize parts of the story recounted by her relatives. Rokni voice-over narrates the video where she describes the confusion around the wedding date, which remains unresolved at the end of the piece by her family members. Through the misremembering of the family induced by the chaotic moment, Rokni achieves a powerful portrait of the construction of political and intimate histories.","Born just after the Islamic Revolution, Elham Rokni (b. 1980, Tehran, Iran) grew up in the politically unstable Tehran. Rokni immigrated to Israel at the age of 9 and today she is living and working in Tel Aviv. In her drawings and video installations, she repeatedly constructs and deconstructs imagery related to her childhood memories and her family photo album from her family’s time in Tehran.

Nina Könnemann,"For many years, Nina Könnemann has placed a camera before a billboard situated in the suburb Neukoln in Berlin. The silent film that exposes the both banal and paradoxical passages of time and space of the passers by highlights the transformation of public space. The surface of exhibition—the billboard—becomes a wall behind which the fascination of the artwork concentrates. The video shows individuals going behind the billboard to urinate, take drugs, meet—masked behaviors behind the object intended for observation, the billboard. The audience does not explicitly see what is happening behind the billboard, only the before and after. The public space is transformed into an intimate place that the artist does not try to reveal, thus increasing the fantasy about the possible: simple urinal, place of dealings, and places of exchanges, meetings. The apparent neutrality of the objective makes it possible to relate different spheres: those of the visible and the invisible, the real and the fantasies, the intimate and the public, the objective object and its subjective representation. By a mirror parallel to the presentation of “What’s New”, the projection screen in the exhibition space doubles as a figure of the billboard in the public space.","Nina Könnemann (b. 1971, Bonn, Germany) is a contemporary video artist. Since the 2000s, she has developed her video practice alongside installations and sculpture. The camera of Nina Könnemann borrows from realistic cinema and structural materialism. Located at the crossroads of Vertov’s “Cinema-Eye”—which records a reality that the habit would prevent from seeing—and Anglo-Saxon experimental cinema, such that of Hollis Frampton and Michael Snow, where the consciousness of the medium is omnipresent, Könnemann closely examines marginal spaces, human behavior and subcultures. As an observer of public spaces, Könnemann documents in detail how social relations produced by social conditioning are manifested in the form of micro-interactions.",What’s new,Europe,"['public.a.01', 'fantasy.n.01', 'space.n.01', 'populace.n.01', 'mirror.n.01', 'object.n.01', 'transform.v.01', 'presentation.n.01', 'transformation.n.01', 'invisible.a.01', 'uncover.v.01', 'passage.n.01', 'exchange.n.01', 'projection.n.01', 'audience.n.01', 'visible.a.01', 'screen.n.01', 'simple.a.01', 'person.n.01', 'artwork.n.01', 'real.a.01', 'surface.n.01', 'representation.n.01', 'wall.n.01', 'camera.n.01']","['public.a.01', 'private.s.02', 'space.n.03', 'confidant.n.01', 'everyday.s.01', 'world.n.03']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/nina-konnemann-kadist-6.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/nina-konnemann-kadist-6-300x169.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/whats-new/,"['Material_Physical/5.107692307692307', 'Cultural/3.076923076923077', 'Society/2.426373626373626']","['Material_Physical', 'Cultural', 'Society']",10.61098901098901,"['Culture/2.307692307692308', 'Land/2.307692307692308', 'Urbanization/1.5692307692307694']","['Culture', 'Land', 'Urbanization']",6.184615384615386,"['Cultural/22.906907471613366', 'Society/18.972752393805028', 'Individual_Personal/18.737157940099124']","['Cultural', 'Society', 'Individual_Personal']",60.61681780551751,"['Mind/7.501734539969834', 'Economy/4.718803418803419', 'Body/4.142210730446025']","['Mind', 'Economy', 'Body']",16.362748689219277,0.6666666666666666,0.0
Martha Araújo,"In Habito/Habitante, the suspended material renders the wall a prison and the participant a prisoner. The liberating impulsion releases the participant. The act of freeing oneself, of flying, and escaping from constraints is an action that is both extremely symbolically and physically significant. The sound produced by the Velcro upon the detachment of the material from the wall enhances this sense of release. The repetition of the same gesture during a performance gives the act a status of ritual, giving awareness to the power of the action. The work has a political and social meaning lies in the epoch within which it was created—the transitional period when Brazil became a democracy in the 1985 elections. The individual dimension of the liberating experience is thought as a moment of collective construction of a new political context. This work is a testimony and a witness to the emotions and the spirit of the state in this moment of profound political change that is inscribed in the physical and psychological body of an entire generation. Martha Araujo states: “For me these gests are the means to find ourselves with ourselves, the others and the environment within which we live while liberating ourselves”.","Since the 1980s, Martha Araujo, (b. 1943 Maceio, Brazil) has explored the physical and psychology limits of the body. She has explored space, the body and mind by asking spectators to use objects and clothing that she produces and exhibits in exhibition spaces. Many of her works are related to her performing installations between 1982 and 1987 entitled “Habito / Habitante”. From a historical perspective, her approach relates to Helio Oïticica and Lygia Clark. Her work is now being reconsidered, like those of other artists from South America, thought to be an alternative to performative gestures in the United States and Europe. The use of the body is linked to African-Brazilian rituals, carnivals and especially to specific political contexts where the body is a means of resistance.",Habito/Habitante,Unspecified,"['political.a.01', 'action.n.01', 'moment.n.01', 'wall.n.01', 'material.n.01', 'prison.n.01', 'witness.n.01', 'status.n.01', 'spirit.n.01', 'psychological.s.01', 'change.n.01', 'repeat.n.01', 'dimension.n.01', 'coevals.n.01', 'era.n.01', 'corporate.s.03', 'produce.v.01', 'time_period.n.01', 'physical.a.01', 'construction.n.01', 'individual.a.01', 'gesture.n.01', 'sound.n.01', 'environment.n.01', 'meaning.n.01']","['captivity.n.01', 'control.n.02', 'freedom.n.01', 'politics.n.01', 'body.n.01', 'performance.n.03', 'democracy.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/martha_araujo_01-media_res.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/martha_araujo_01-media_res-300x168.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/habito-habitante/,"['Material_Physical/9.541758241758242', 'Individual_Personal/5.457142857142856', 'Politics/4.371428571428571']","['Material_Physical', 'Individual_Personal', 'Politics']",19.370329670329667,"['Space/6.346153846153846', 'Body/2.8', 'Values/1.8571428571428572']","['Space', 'Body', 'Values']",11.003296703296703,"['Individual_Personal/19.170347299759065', 'Society/18.547288968341604', 'Material_Physical/15.527247752247753']","['Individual_Personal', 'Society', 'Material_Physical']",53.24488402034842,"['Time/8.821386946386946', 'Body/6.06638459579636', 'History/5.795171495171495']","['Time', 'Body', 'History']",20.6829430373548,0.6666666666666666,0.3333333333333333
Julieta Aranda,"The video Swimming in rivers of Glue is composed of various images of nature, exploring the themes of exploration of space and its colonization. The images show the diversity of forms of life on earth. These forms are associated with texts that relay a form of propaganda. Interviews are conducted, and often refer to the most urgent issues concerning humanity. The interviews are the revealers of fear and anxiety that contaminate the entire film. The video has the effectiveness of a propaganda film while opening us to irrational and poetic images, as can still be the theme of the conquest of space. Like all Aranda’s works, the purpose of this video is related to our experience of space that has been diverted to be thought of as a means of subjugation and control.","Julieta Aranda is a contemporary artist whose explorations traverse installation, video, and print media. Aranda has a special interest in the creation and manipulation of artistic exchange and the subversion of traditional notions of commerce through art making. She is currently based in Berlin and New York City. She holds a degree from Columbia University and is the Editor of e-Flux. For many years, Aranda has been interested in design and architecture. She observes the ways through which planning of public space; architecture and design are often thought of and employed as a way to control the body. These city-planning devices establish physical frontiers that respond to the fences of information and knowledge in our age of hyper-connectivity. These themes have lead the artist to take an interest in the notions of time, circulation and imagination by examining social interactions and the role that the circulation of objects plays in the cycle of production and consumption. She seeks, by highlighting its arbitrary dimension, alternatives to the experience of time.",Swimming in Rivers of Glue,Americas,"['interview.n.01', 'subject.n.01', 'space.n.01', 'form.n.01', 'video.n.01', 'exploration.n.01', 'river.n.01', 'control.n.01', 'fear.n.01', 'purpose.n.01', 'movie.n.01', 'image.n.01', 'earth.n.01', 'poetic.a.01', 'compose.v.01', 'issue.n.01', 'nature.n.01', 'experience.n.01', 'life.n.01']","['life.n.02', 'picture.n.01', 'world.n.08', 'space.n.03', 'propaganda.n.01', 'environment.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Swimming-in-Rivers-of-Glue_1.png,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Swimming-in-Rivers-of-Glue_1-300x169.png,https://kadist.org/work/swimming-in-rivers-of-glue/,"['Cultural/7.332315233785822', 'Material_Physical/5.887912087912087', 'Individual_Personal/4.35042735042735']","['Cultural', 'Material_Physical', 'Individual_Personal']",17.570654672125258,"['Land/3.1648351648351647', 'Culture/2.307692307692308', 'Media/1.7025641025641027']","['Land', 'Culture', 'Media']",7.175091575091575,"['Individual_Personal/34.401098901098905', 'Cultural/21.99517704517705', 'Material_Physical/9.852533577533578']","['Individual_Personal', 'Cultural', 'Material_Physical']",66.24880952380954,"['Emotion/11.343223443223446', 'Mind/11.180219780219781', 'Culture/10.346153846153847']","['Emotion', 'Mind', 'Culture']",32.86959706959708,1.0,0.3333333333333333
Thu Van Tran,"From Green to Orange is a series of silver films immersed in a bath of dye and rust. While the perception of the subject is made difficult by the chemical reaction, vegetation becomes discernible at a closer look. Thu Van Tran interferes in the depths of a mystery, in the density of a hallucinated dream. The impression that this jungle is burning is underscored by the title that refers to the color names of defoliants dropped in Vietnam by the US military during the war. “Dust trail” is the name chosen by the US military to designate the toxic dependence operation conducted from 1961 in South Vietnam. The most used defoliants were Agent Orange, a stable, non-soluble product that contaminates the interior for a long time. The chemical has insinuated itself into the food chain and the populations genetics. The leaves visible in the photograph are those of the rubber tree that was brought from Amazonia by a French sailor. It quickly became a natural wealth of Vietnam but led to the occupation of a very large part of the fertile land by French settlers. This work crystallizes physically and symbolically different references that are war, colonialism, and economic exchanges, but also the mysterious and romantic aspect of the jungle conveyed in Western culture.","Currently based in Paris, Thu Van Tran, whose work is been characterized by literature, architecture and history, has lived a paradox of the dismantlement of the French colonial empire. Her grandfather was Algerian and was enrolled in the colonial wars; he met her grandmother, who was French, in Indo-China. She was born between two cultures, languages and national identities.

Gabriel Borba Filho,"Gabriel Borba Filho was aware of what was happening on the other side of the Atlantic, and Untitled (Nos) is linked to both the social and political climates in Brazil and Spain during the Franco period. The title Nos (Us) echoes this sharing of a situation of misfortune. He was particularly touched by the execution of Salvador Puig Antich, to whom this work pays homage, and also by the political assassination of one of his best friends. Salvador Puig Antich was a Catalan anarchist executed in 1974. After being tortured, he was put on his feet to suffer. He was the last political prisoner garroté of Franco’s rule. As by obsession it so is that the images remain in memory throughout the series; the same subject and the same photo is represented several times. What is especially interesting in Untitled (Nos) is that the subject is face to face with himself, with his own situation, in full consciousness despite the ordeal. Self-awareness is a way to affirm the strength of life and to free oneself from the adversities of the totalitarian state. The presence of this young body places us in a position between violence and sensuality. This work responds in the collection to the series of photographs of Pazos and the installation of Marta Araujo.","Gabriel Borba Filho is an important actor in the Brazilian art scene during the 1960s and ‘70s. Educated as an architect, he has been recognized as a pioneer in Brazilian video art for his role in the creation of an experimental space in the Museu de Arte Contemporana at the University of São Paulo. This experimental laboratory was the place where artists could develop new artistic practices in the context of a totalitarian regime. All of the artists’ works are to be thought of in the context of lack of freedom and lack of democracy. Borba Filho’s stance against violence and silence against dictatorship never faltered, and his practice as a visual poet continues to play the role of a significant commentary in today’s age.",Untitled (Nos),Americas,"['situation.n.01', 'political.a.01', 'subject.n.01', 'rule.n.01', 'consciousness.n.01', 'times.n.01', 'represent.v.01', 'photograph.n.01', 'position.n.01', 'time_period.n.01', 'presence.n.01', 'violence.n.01', 'series.n.01', 'memory.n.01', 'title.n.01', 'social.a.01', 'body.n.01', 'life.n.01', 'image.n.01']","['politics.n.01', 'execution.n.01', 'anguish.n.01', 'violence.n.01', 'anarchy.n.01', 'dictator.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Untitled-Nos-G.-Borba-Filho-.jpeg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Untitled-Nos-G.-Borba-Filho--300x212.jpeg,https://kadist.org/work/untitled-nos/,"['Politics/5.98562091503268', 'Society/4.3538748832866485', 'Individual_Personal/1.5692307692307694']","['Politics', 'Society', 'Individual_Personal']",11.908726567550097,"['Activism/3.4078431372549023', 'Violence/2.7983193277310923', 'Politics/1.0']","['Activism', 'Violence', 'Politics']",7.2061624649859946,"['Individual_Personal/30.6759389303507', 'Material_Physical/24.815251415251417', 'Cultural/17.1417672197084']","['Individual_Personal', 'Material_Physical', 'Cultural']",72.63295756531052,"['Body/7.725940725940726', 'Mind/7.589528118939883', 'Materiality/7.5527472527472534']","['Body', 'Mind', 'Materiality']",22.86821609762786,0.3333333333333333,0.0
Yael Bartana,"Yael Bartana received great international attention for the trilogy series And Europe Will be Stunned (2007 – 2011). The series, which includes the films Mary Koszmary (Nightmare) (2007), Mur i wieza (Wall and Tower) (2009), and Zamach (Assassination) (2011), centers on a young Polish politician’s call for the return of 3.3 million Jewish people who emigrated to Palestine. The films employ the same techniques of Leni Riefenstahl’s Nazi propaganda films, combining fact and fiction with the past and the present. Opening film Mary Koszmary (Nightmares) is set in the ruins of Warsaw’s Stadion Dziesieciolecia (Decennial Stadium) where the politician Slawomir Sierakowski is identified and summons the return of the Jewish people from today’s Israel. The second film Mur I Wieza (Wall and Tower) we see the establishment of loyal and idealistic followers of Sierakowski and the Jewish Renaissance Movement. They build a barbed wire wrapped tower-and-stockade-style kibbutz that was a settlement method established and developed by Zionists in Palestine from 1936–39. The final film Zamach (Assassination) sees the assassination of Sierakowski by an unknown assailant, which solidifies the Jewish Renaissance Movement. The three films bring together images of past and present Israeli and Polish identities and imagines a dangerous future.","The work of Yael Bartana investigates the imagination and imagery of identity and the politics of national memory and identity. Her interest in understanding and examining national statehood stems from being born in Israel, and being surrounded by the perpetual production of collective national identity. After completing her studies, Bartana undertook what she called ‘amateur anthropological’ research into ritual and myth making to take a critical perspective towards her own history and nationality. As a result of her politically charged practice that often deals with Jewish identity in Israel and abroad, she has garnered significant criticism, notably being labeled as anti-Zionist and a self-hating Jew. Despite this criticism, Bartana believes that, through her work as an artist, exploring both political statehood and religious and political diaspora, she is responsible for addressing these issues. Bartana believes that growing up in such a politically charged state requires artists to become either political artists, or escapists.",And Europe Will Be Stunned,Europe,"['movie.n.01', 'wall.n.01', 'motion.n.03', 'people.n.01', 'method.n.01', 'unknown.a.01', 'europe.n.01', 'concluding.s.01', 'put.v.01', 'technique.n.01', 'future.n.01', 'fiction.n.01', 'attention.n.01', 'series.n.01', 'center.n.01', 'identity.n.01', 'image.n.01']","['identity.n.01', 'zionism.n.01', 'palestine.n.01', 'propaganda.n.01', 'occupation.n.02', 'political.a.02']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Figure6.png,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Figure6-300x174.png,https://kadist.org/work/and-europe-will-be-stunned/,"['Individual_Personal/5.575757575757575', 'Society/5.04593884376493', 'Politics/2.6985294117647056']","['Individual_Personal', 'Society', 'Politics']",13.32022583128721,"['Identity/4.797979797979798', 'Inequality/1.6985294117647058', 'Urbanization/1.657142857142857']","['Identity', 'Inequality', 'Urbanization']",8.15365206688736,"['Cultural/21.039885441356034', 'Material_Physical/13.425152625152627', 'Individual_Personal/13.281399319634618']","['Cultural', 'Material_Physical', 'Individual_Personal']",47.74643738614328,"['Fantasy/6.291666666666667', 'Time/6.136507936507937', 'Identity/4.797979797979798']","['Fantasy', 'Time', 'Identity']",17.226154401154403,0.3333333333333333,0.3333333333333333
Malick Sidibé,"Au bord du Fleuve Niger (1976) offers a unique insight into the lives of the 1970s in Bamako. The photograph provides a glimpse into the notoriously active and exciting life alongside the Niger River, where parties would often last until the early hours of the morning. The gaze of the teenage boys who pose for Sidibé bears witness to an intimate space between the lens of the camera, the artist, subjects and the viewer. This work is testament to Sidibé’s skill for capturing and sharing a moment. During the hot seasons, Sidibé would often go down to the Niger River to drink tea, dance and bathe –– it was here that he would take many spontaneous pictures of the others, although many young people posed and asked for pictures themselves. It is presumable thus that the boys in Au bord du Fleuve Niger (1976) approached Sidibé for the photo.","Malick Sidibé was a witness and participant in the changing of African youth culture, divided between tradition and the emergence of fashion, music and lifestyle influenced by the Western world. A celebrated photographer, Sidibé worked primarily in black and white and captured moments of celebration, burgeoning pop culture, and the nightlife of Bamako from the mid-20th century onwards. His photographs that documented the exciting and dynamic crossroad of culture also included portraits of young people elegantly dressed in posed studio shoots. Sidibé was selected to attend the School of Sudanese Craftsmen and later worked as an apprentice at the Gérard Guillat-Guignard’s Photo Service Boutique — it was here that he developed his skill and interest in photography. In all of his photographs emerge spontaneity, an atmosphere of celebration, laughter, dynamism and life, providing an important and unique insight into Bamako.

Moké,"Moké’s Sans Titre (1994) depicts the everyday life of the suburbs from a distant and elevated perspective. Looking down on a residential area we see groups of children playing in the street, we see cars and trucks loaded with produce backed up on the road that runs through the center of the tableau. We see two Skol adverting billboards that line the road; Skol being the fifth biggest beer brand by volume in the world that was established in the Democratic Republic of Congo in 1965. An outward flying plane glides closely over the scene. Sans Titre (1994) is, above all, a scene of the various structures and functions of society seemingly peacefully co-existing.","Moké (the acronym of Monsengwo Kejwamfi) was a pivotal figure in establishing the style of ‘Popular Painting’ in Kinshasa following Congo’s independence in 1960. Moké had no formal training and his early works were often executed on found materials, such as discarded cardboard. Soon, his lively and dynamic paintings of Kinshasa garnered the attention of the public and in 1965 he painted a portrait of General Mobutu (president of the DRC, 1965–1997). Moké became a reporter of urbanity through his painting, and installed his workshop at the crossroads of Kasa-vubu and Bolobo, in the heart of the city. His realistic and exuberant painting testifies to his meticulous observation of everyday life in Kinshasa: street scenes, bar scenes, sappers, nocturnal feasts, and neighbourhood disputes.

Jumana Manna,"Blue Elbow (Coude bleu) is made from plaster, burlap, lacquer, pigments and plastics. The materials related to the techniques of the sculpture or the painting but also others, which refer to commerce, to objects of consumption. The chair refers directly to the body as does the title of the work, Blue Elbow. The amphora itself becomes organic and opposes the rigidity of the chair. The chair becomes elbow and the evocation of the blue brings back to the body, to a wound, to an injury. She calls the vases of this series “Muscle Vases”. The work is part of the Menace of the Origins project which begun at the Sculpture Center in New York in 2014. The project highlights the potential violence of archaeological excavations and the instrumentalization of remains. Manna often refers to a predominantly masculine and western violence that comes from the experience of the power here represented by penetration. For Manna, sculptures are a privileged space for exploring materiality, the physical relation that the body has with objects, space and materials; she states: “I am interested in the way objects are vehicles or agents like our bodies are ships of subjectivity”.","Jumana Manna is a Berlin-based artist whose work revolves around the body, national identity, and historical narratives. She produces films and installations that employ methodologies sometimes attributed to the historian or the anthropologist. She immerses herself in her projects to define a practice that questions the limits of the body in relation to historical and national narratives. She creates sculptures that are both deconstructions and aggregations of many elements. She uses resin but also bones, wood, or ready-made objects. The objects are reused in ways other than the ones that have been assigned to them, allowing for new stories to be told, and affirming their material dimension.",Blue Elbow (Coude Bleu),Unspecified,"['body.n.01', 'violence.n.01', 'sculpture.n.01', 'object.n.01', 'undertaking.n.01', 'material.n.01', 'plastic.n.01', 'potential.a.01', 'new_york.n.01', 'york.n.01', 'injury.n.01', 'represent.v.01', 'western.a.01', 'space.n.01', 'technique.n.01', 'relation.n.01', 'physical.a.01', 'center.n.01', 'beginning.n.04', 'power.n.01', 'experience.n.01', 'title.n.01']","['consumption.n.03', 'body.n.01', 'archeology.n.01', 'violence.n.01', 'power.n.01', 'materiality.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/JM9266-a-1.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/JM9266-a-1-203x300.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/blue-elbow-coude-bleu/,"['Material_Physical/11.80842490842491', 'Politics/5.871013300425065', 'Individual_Personal/4.2']","['Material_Physical', 'Politics', 'Individual_Personal']",21.879438208849976,"['Space/6.346153846153846', 'Power/3.311655011655012', 'Physics/2.293040293040293']","['Space', 'Power', 'Physics']",11.950849150849152,"['Material_Physical/21.08522588522589', 'Society/13.118239320019507', 'Cultural/12.176357466063353']","['Material_Physical', 'Society', 'Cultural']",46.379822671308744,"['Space/8.092185592185592', 'Land/5.4743589743589745', 'Power/4.968797868797869']","['Space', 'Land', 'Power']",18.535342435342436,0.3333333333333333,0.6666666666666666
Joscelyn Gardner,"Creole Portraits III alludes to the 18th century practice by slave women on Caribbean plantations of using tropical plants as natural abortifacients. As an act of political resistance against their exploitation as “breeders” of new slaves and to protest the inhumanity of slavery, some slave women chose to either abort or kill their offspring. Armed with practical knowledge passed on orally from their African ancestors and/or Amerindian counterparts, enslaved Creole women collected the seeds, bark, flowers, sap, and roots from various plants which allowed them to secretly put an end to their pregnancies. The lithographic portraits reveal intricately braided Afro-centric hairstyles viewed from behind entwined within the iron slave collars which were used to punish female slaves accused of inducing abortion. Each portrait also displays one of the botanical specimens used for this purpose.","Joscelyn Gardner is a Caribbean / Canadian visual artist working primarily with printmaking and multimedia installation. Her contemporary practice probes colonial material culture found in British / Caribbean archives in order to explore her identity from a postcolonial feminist perspective.

Markus Amm,"A combination of planning and improvisation, control and lack of control, this painting is typical of Amm’s work. With its intimations of the sublime and reference to the works of Ad Reinhardt and Mark Rothko this painting extends the Romantic and modernist traditions in a perceptive way. These are subtle, slow, delicate paintings that evolve over a period of time—the product of long periods of contemplation. Subtle gradations of tone, small eclipses and traces of underlayers give the work a secretive atmosphere that seems at once to refer to nature and to nothing at all, challenging what we are capable of seeing. “It’s like a game of ping pong,” he says of his creative working process. “For instance a speck of dust could fly into the paint and I may have to wipe it out. It’s a constant reaction to what’s going on. I’m playing my part, and then seeing how the material is reacting.

Fran Herndon,"Working independently, Herndon experimented at the forefront of a now-canonical method—appropriation—by painting additions into found images from magazines such as Life and Sports Illustrated in a way that imbues the resulting works with mythical significance. Associated with the Beat movement, her work is integral to that part of the history of San Francisco. White Angel (1962), painted in the year of Marilyn Monroe’s death, portrays the actress in a process of devolution. Pictured upright in Vogue at the top-right of the frame, she sinks in stages to its lower left, increasingly engulfed by encroaching layers of paint and paper. Beneath fiery, scribbled, gestural marks and surrounded by foreboding, masked figures, her famous, partially obscured smile looks like a grimace.","Fran Herndon was born in Oklahoma in 1929, then moved to San Francisco in 1957, where she came into contact with Jack Spicer, who encouraged her painting practice by motivating her to study at the California School of Fine Arts (now the San Francisco Art Institute).  They collaborated on a few important poetry works including Homage to Creeley Heads of the Town Up to the Aether and J magazine.

Unlike the traditional vanishing point, the rays here emanate from the surface’s middle and hover around an indefinite and impossible convergence.

Many of his works use his “butterfly model” of skewed perspectival lines. These images conjure both infinite transcendence and the graphic design of book covers or psychedelic posters.

Here, Garaicoa’s interest in vernacular Cuban architecture shifts towards the European context: a series of twelve nineteenth-century French engravings have been reworked into delicate paper models. Here, the two-dimensional old-school architectural renderings have become the foundation for new hollow three-dimensional structures. Reminiscent of pop-up storybooks, the small-scale paper forms have also been augmented with black paper shapes, which both resemble the images in a shadow theater and recall abstract modernist forms.","Like many other Latin American artists in the Kadist Collection, Cuban-born Carlos Garaicoa’s conceptual works look at architecture as a palpable indicator of the region’s socio-political and cultural histories. Working since the early 1990s in a wide range of media that includes sculpture, drawing, video, and photography, Garaicoa explores architectural forms and urban landscape aiming to reveal the multiple facets of the modern project’s failure in the Latin American context.

Rodney Graham,"Basement Camera Shop circa 1937 (2011) is part of a series of photographic self-portraits in which Rodney Graham plays a host of characters. In the series as a whole, Graham makes the case that identity is performed. Here, we see the artist behind a shop desk lined with early cameras and boxes of Kodak film. As the buttoned-up clerk scrawls a note, the ragged upper edge of the stage set is clearly visible above him. The scene’s self-referential, transparent artifice insists that photography itself is also about performance, and that the medium’s potential to generate vivid fictions might be more interesting than its historical role as a supposed conveyor of objective reality.","Conceptual artist Rodney Graham’s oeuvre is highly versatile and intellectual. By incorporating fictional narratives and alternative interpretations into an existing context, Graham creates visual puns that layer historical reference to examine social and philosophical systems.

This change in gesture redirects the image’s focal point to the cards; in gambling such a subtle and involuntary shift in body language is known as a “tell,” and could give the game away.","Conceptual artist Rodney Graham’s oeuvre is highly versatile and intellectual.

Tina Modotti,"The Italian photographer Tina Modotti is known for her documentation of the mural movement in Mexico. She had a keen eye for architectural composition, and captured eloquent details using a delicate platinum print process. In 1929 she was deported from Mexico because of her involvement in the Communist party and went to Europe. Soon thereafter her work began to blend her eye for space and shape with a more critical social angle, often engaging in an overtly anti-Fascist discourses. Untitled (Cathedral) (ca. 1930), taken after her arrival in Europe, is an excellent example of her skillfully composed architectural pictures. It evokes ideas about how the composition of public spaces can influence both politics and cultural life.","Tina Modotti was an Italian film actress and photographer. As a photographer, she collaborated with Edward Weston and extensively documented the Mexican mural movement. In addition to her photography of Diego Rivera’s murals, she is also depicted in five of them. Modotti was involved in both the artistic and political avant-gardes of Mexico City, befriending members of and eventually joining the Mexican Communist party. Political repression forced her to move back to Europe, and she eventually lived in Moscow before moving to Spain when the Civil war began in 1936. In 1939, she returned to Mexico, where she died in 1942.",Untitled (Cathedral),Unspecified,"['eye.n.01', 'europe.n.01', 'architectural.a.01', 'mexico.n.01', 'composition.n.01', 'party.n.01', 'discourse.n.01', 'critical.a.01', 'documentation.n.01', 'space.n.01', 'photographer.n.01', 'politics.n.01', 'details.n.01', 'picture.n.01', 'shape.n.01', 'public.a.01', 'idea.n.01', 'motion.n.03', 'cultural.a.01', 'procedure.n.01', 'social.a.01', 'life.n.01']","['architecture.n.01', 'urbanity.n.02', 'public.s.02', 'photographic_print.n.01', 'cathedral.n.02', 'civic.a.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/tina_modotti_untitled_cathedral_1930.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/tina_modotti_untitled_cathedral_1930-200x300.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/untitled-cathedral/,"['Cultural/7.508169934640522', 'Society/1.6', 'Individual_Personal/1.6']","['Cultural', 'Society', 'Individual_Personal']",10.708169934640521,"['Arts/5.077614379084967', 'Design/1.5555555555555556', 'Media/0.875']","['Arts', 'Design', 'Media']",7.508169934640522,"['Individual_Personal/24.925152625152638', 'Cultural/19.26060655031244', 'Society/14.013028801264099']","['Individual_Personal', 'Cultural', 'Society']",58.19878797672918,"['Spirituality/7.167399267399268', 'Values/5.92967032967033', 'Culture/5.926373626373627']","['Spirituality', 'Values', 'Culture']",19.023443223443223,1.0,0.0
Rodney Graham,"Ponderosa Pine IV belongs to a series of large-scale photographs of trees taken by Graham and depicts a particular species that live in Northern California. The photograph is framed upside down; these “inverted trees” follow Graham’s early experiments with the camera lucida, a room-sized pinhole camera that dates back to ancient times and which he has used to photograph trees from various regions. Through these works Graham looks back at the history of photography while making the viewers aware of their own retinal experience. In the case of the Ponderosa Pine series, the artist’s use of a pinewood frame gives the elephantine inverted tree both a physical presence and a rather morbid veil.","Conceptual artist Rodney Graham’s oeuvre is highly versatile and intellectual.

Chulayarnnon Siriphol,"The single-channel video Myth of Modernity opens on historical representations of the universe in Thai Buddhist places of worship –pagodas, palaces and spirit houses. Denoting three cosmological worlds, the colored religious illustrations and ornate monuments are slowly replaced by images of anti-Yingluck protesters during the 2013-2014 Thai political crisis. Over the masses, a flying neon pyramid –the light sculpture Myth of Modernity– echoes the popular simplification of worship architecture into geometrical shapes. Such associations between the political state and religious realms of worship imply an idealistic reverie among politicians and masses. The gradual oversimplification of the worship structures and its connection with political instances remind us of the risk for religious or political instrumentalization, recalling the polarization of society on political matters and the nationalisms’ influences.","Closely associated with the film scene in Thailand, Chulayarnnon Siriphol has also developed a singular approach to film and image making as a visual artist. In-between personal and social memories, documentary and fiction, reality and supernatural, his experimental films, videos, and video installations often explore the relations between history and memory through the lens of Thailand’s context.

Yoshua Okón,"Fridge-Freezer is a 2-channel video installation where Yoshua Okón explores the darker side of suburbia, described by the artist as “the ideal environment for a numb existence of passive consumerism and social and environmental disengagement.” Filmed at display homes in the suburbs of Manchester in the United Kingdom, the video features real-estate agents clad in bright-red blazers enthusiastically describing features of the ‘dream home’ as they walk through different rooms. A couple of additional elements, a couch and neutral soft carpet, recreate the domestic setting and immerse the viewer in the unfolding scenes. As the video progresses, the real-estate agents are seen between showings in moments of crisis and panic, breathing heavily or completely melting down. Fridge-Freezer portrays the illusion of safety and prosperity that suburbia provides, and most importantly, the alienation and its side effects, which remain hidden underneath the pristine surfaces of the perfect home.","Working primarily in video, Okón combines the genre of documentary with performativeelements that together blur the boundary between reality and fiction. His video installations capture improvisational narratives created by the artist and his collaborators—performers willing to participate in a game of social chance that may easily spiral out of control. In them, the camera acts as a catalyst that unleashes his subjects, empowering them to act out an assumed character and in the process revealing their own awareness and perceptions.  Characterized by their uncomfortable, somber nature these works deliberately provoke viewers through confrontational humor as a way to achieve catharsis. His videos are used as a device to implicate audiences and also activate them as a participant, pressuring them to consider questions of social conduct and personal behavior within the context of the authoritative nation-state, and to question their own attitudes towards power, ethics, and prejudice vis-á-vis class, status, and marginality.  Described by Okón as near-sociological experiments, his works give the audience a unique insight into the subjects he portrays. Most importantly, they also evoke a sense of interconnectivity: deeply implicating us in issues that we may normally consider foreign or removed from our everyday lives.",Fridge-Freezer,Americas,"['video.n.01', 'illusion.n.01', 'film.v.01', 'being.n.01', 'setting.n.01', 'display.n.01', 'dream.n.01', 'feature.n.01', 'effects.n.01', 'environment.n.01', 'surface.n.01', 'elements.n.01', 'moment.n.01', 'scene.n.01', 'spectator.n.01', 'social.a.01']","['suburb.n.01', 'consumerism.n.01', 'passive_voice.n.01', 'devastation.n.01', 'isolation.n.01', 'alienation.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/IMG_fridge_freezer_video-still-WEB.png,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/IMG_fridge_freezer_video-still-WEB-300x83.png,https://kadist.org/work/fridge-freezer/,"['Individual_Personal/7.995726495726496', 'Society/4.335464535464536', 'Material_Physical/1.6753246753246753']","['Individual_Personal', 'Society', 'Material_Physical']",14.006515706515708,"['Emotion/6.217948717948718', 'Economy/1.9090909090909092', 'Urbanization/1.657142857142857']","['Emotion', 'Economy', 'Urbanization']",9.784182484182484,"['Material_Physical/14.452980352980354', 'Individual_Personal/10.253677041912336', 'Cultural/9.675091575091576']","['Material_Physical', 'Individual_Personal', 'Cultural']",34.381748969984265,"['Land/5.687912087912088', 'Materiality/4.451515151515151', 'Mind/3.4000000000000004']","['Land', 'Materiality', 'Mind']",13.539427239427239,0.6666666666666666,0.0
Edgardo Aragón,"Mesoamericana (Economic activities) is part of a larger project titled Mesoamerica: The Hurricane Effect, which includes a video as well as series of hand drawn maps -based on historical cartography- that examine the effects of foreign power in Mexico today. Mesoamerica was home to a rich civilization that emerged around 10,000 years BC and out of which grew the rich Maya, Aztec and Zapotec cultures, among many others. These cultures were destroyed by the Spanish, who arrived in the 15th and 16th centuries. Today, “Mesoamerica” is also the short name for a multi-million dollar development project that is officially called the Mesoamerican Integration and Development Project and is financed and run by the United States. However, due to rampant corruption at all levels, the project doesn’t benefit the poor communities and instead helps foreign companies that operate in the region.  Mesoamericana (Economic activities) speaks about how drugs are representing a large part of the global economic system. Maps depict various countries in Latin America via historical maps onto which the artists draw fantastical and menacing creatures as well as as pointing towards economic and political dependencies and realities as the result of colonial rule and contemporary political corruption.  Edgardo Aragón’s works employ reenactment to reflect the everyday reality of rural Mexico. Using narratives inspired by the particularities of their respective local contexts, Aragón evokes events—some with very violent undertones—and shapes them into scenes molded by landscapes. His work also addresses points of familial and social inheritance that are conditioned by the local environment, creating a personal body of work recounted through poetic narratives. Each piece is a story slowly told—a description of a memory or a reconstruction of a personal experience—that shows some of the darker sides of Mexico’s social and economic realities.","Edgardo Aragón’s works employ reenactment to reflect the everyday reality of rural Mexico.

Matthieu Saladin,"L’effeuillage des effacements (The Stripping of Erasures) 2016, presents a piles of posters gathered in decreasing chronological order from 2015 to 2400 B.C. of 150 historical episodes of debt cancellation (one event per poster).

As the public takes the posters, the artwork developed into a verified history of cancellation that emerges, a kind of counter-history of indebtedness. The erasure of the pages appears to be motivated by a multiplicity of political ambitions, in which the emancipation of decolonization goes hand in hand with the populist measure, which guarantees the success of a coup d’état, and passing by the neo-liberal strategy imposing privatization of the public sector.","Through a conceptual approach, Matthieu Saladin (born in 1978 in France) develops his practice around an exploration of how contemporary economic mechanisms shape social relations and subjectivities. Using sound, print, performance, object and information technologies, Saladin proceeds by accumulation, displacement, diversion and tautology, pushing logic to the limit and interfering with the functioning of devices and structures to whose solicit it.  His exhibition The Promise of Debt (Salle Principale gallery, Paris, 2016) was developed around a reflection on the issue of debt taking place in a significant economic context: the post subprime crisis in the United States, and the threat in Europe of defaulting on sovereign debt. However, rather than dwelling on these situations, the artist prefers to probe the philosophical underpinnings of debt, a moral contract that conditions our social relations since the dawn of time. Who gives? Who takes it? Who is lending? Who’s right? Following the Italian sociologist and philosopher Maurizio Lazzarato in his analysis of neoliberalism as a ‘mankind of indebtedness,’ the artist insists on this unbalanced form of social relation, a tool of power of a creditor over a debtor, which acts on the subjectivity of the latter by imposing on him a morality and by mortgaging his future.",L’effeuillage des effacements (The Stripping of Erasures),Europe,"['poster.n.01', 'hand.n.01', 'public.a.01', 'episode.n.01', 'scheme.n.01', 'design.n.01', 'studio.n.01', 'artwork.n.01', 'event.n.01', 'historical.a.01', 'political.a.01', 'history.n.01']","['indebtedness.n.01', 'liberation.n.01', 'emancipation.n.01', 'counter.r.01', ""coup_d'etat.n.01"", 'erasure.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/saladin_l_effeuillage_des_effacements_salle_principale_large.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/saladin_l_effeuillage_des_effacements_salle_principale_large-300x278.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/leffeuillage-des-effacements-the-stripping-of-erasures-2016/,"['Politics/1.6', 'Cultural/1.5384615384615385', 'Society/1.0']","['Politics', 'Cultural', 'Society']",4.138461538461539,"['War/1.0', 'Values/0.8', 'Power/0.8']","['War', 'Values', 'Power']",2.6,"['Cultural/8.267260843731432', 'Material_Physical/5.744988344988345', 'Society/4.1692307692307695']","['Cultural', 'Material_Physical', 'Society']",18.181479957950547,"['Arts/4.8437314319667255', 'Time/4.111655011655012', 'Activism/2.442105263157895']","['Arts', 'Time', 'Activism']",11.397491706779633,0.6666666666666666,0.0
Suzanne Treister,"HFT The Gardener/Diagrams exemplifies the artist’s interest in esoterica, cybernetic awareness and hallucinatory aesthetics as an emanation and contrast to the real world through the exploring circulations of power. Her fictional character Hillel Fischer Traumberg — a banker turned ‘outsider artist’ — is a HFT, a High Frequency Trader. The character is also a contemporary vision of HCE, the hero of James Joyce in Finnegans Wake, who struggles to wake up in the tumult of dissolving boundaries between art, nature, language, money, mathematics and the trauma of history.     The series HFT The Gardener is a collection of multiple explorations. In one work, the artist uses gematria, Hebrew numerology, to discover numerological equivalents of the botanical names of the psychoactive plants and cross-references them with companies in the Financial Times Global 500 Financial Index. The Diagrams work illustrates the various investigations into the representation of data circulating in the world of High Frequency Trading, concerning companies and the stock market alongside psychoactive drugs and shamanic cultures. Algorithms and diagrams describe Traumberg’s theories about the holographic nature of reality, art and consciousness. Traumberg, techno-shaman, transmutes the spiritual dimension of the universe and the hallucinogenic nature of capital into artistic forms.","Suzanne Treister (born in 1958 in London) studied at St Martin’s School of Art, London (1978–1981) and Chelsea College of Art and Design, London (1981–1982) and is based in London. In the 1980s, Treister’s practice was concerned primarily with painting. Since the 1990s, Suzanne Treister has been a pioneer in the practice of digital art and new media since. Her work explores new technologies and develops fictional worlds to create obscure collaborative international organizations. Her projects often require research and development over several years and can take different forms, including the internet as a medium and platform.

Luis Pazos,"La Cultura de la Felicidad (The Culture of Happiness) is a series of five photographs addressing everyday life—a couple in a bed, lovers on a bench and a family reunion. The subjects wear masks made of white cardboard. The series suggests the idea of a reality hidden under the appearances of the power in place that denies violence to citizens.  Pazos believes that art must respond to the condition of the country by questioning authority and violence in order to give individuals the possibility of constructing a critical discourse. As in Eastern Europe countries, performance has been a means of acting aesthetically and politically in places that are not marked by power with an a priori invisible art form.","Argentinian artist, born in 1940, Luis Pazos transitioned from an experimental poetry and editing practice to the creation of actions and happenings in the 1970s. Pazos uses the human body with the intention of questioning evolving political ideologies. The artist reports and examines the history of Argentina, a country that has suffered years of instability and dictatorship from the late 1960s. In his work Tranformaciones de masas en vivo (1973), he gives instructions to the audience who thus become living sculptures, transforming bodies into geometric shapes, evoking military enlistments as well as resistance forces.

Apostolos Georgiou,"Untitled (2016) is characteristic of the artist’s practice. Apostolos Georgiou invites us into a scene of cinematic tension. In the foreground, a man is kneeling with his hands on his head. One can feel the man in the painting tremble. We see neither the face nor the weapon of the second man. The proof of the crime is absent, as if the threat is psychological and moral, rather than physical. This painting imagines a representation of a balance of power. We see the consequences of a world in crisis, a failing system on several levels: human relationships, between a Greek government and its citizens and the demands of Brussels vis-à-vis Greece.","The oeuvre of Greek artist Apostolos Georgiou is realized by bold and mastered brush strokes. The figurative work does not dwell on details, his characters have modestly composed faces but their expressions are vividly present, offering multiple interpretations of each painting. The scenes depicted are both timeless and contemporary. There are many men, Westerners in costume who seem to be searching. Situations are never explicit and are often absurd. These men are embarrassed. One is almost in scenes of drama of a tragi-comic genre. The compositions of his paintings are large, inviting the viewer to plunge into the scene.  This work is an oeuvre of modern man, one who tries to escape the feeling of anxiety and solitude caused by the incomprehension of the surrounding environment. The maelstrom of the financial and climatic crisis, wars, and population displacements is continuously and aggressively pushed by mass media, and it is through this that we can witness a man lost, submissive or fleeing his fate. The work of Apostolos Georgiou is unescapably political. He states: “The way we read art makes it political or not […] A painting must have the tension to provoke us to look at it; to wake us up from a state of indifference. Then the rest will come” (Frieze magazine, 2014).",Untitled,Europe,"['psychological.s.01', 'hands.n.01', 'head.n.01', 'degree.n.01', 'tension.n.01', 'physical.a.01', 'government.n.01', 'consequence.n.01', 'representation.n.01', 'relationship.n.01', 'power.n.01', 'practice.n.01', 'human.a.01', 'scene.n.01']","['power.n.01', 'oppression.n.01', 'inequality.n.01', 'control.n.01', 'exploitation.n.01', 'agony.n.02']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/AG_170x170cm_2016.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/AG_170x170cm_2016-300x298.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/untitled-2/,"['Politics/11.525208125208126', 'Society/5.969314998726763', 'Individual_Personal/4.141176470588235']","['Politics', 'Society', 'Individual_Personal']",21.635699594523125,"['Power/6.091874791874792', 'Inequality/4.633333333333333', 'Violence/2.6983193277310926']","['Power', 'Inequality', 'Violence']",13.423527452939219,"['Individual_Personal/16.980952380952388', 'Society/14.937718164188757', 'Cultural/13.356684981684985']","['Individual_Personal', 'Society', 'Cultural']",45.27535552682613,"['Culture/5.93470695970696', 'Mind/4.9282051282051285', 'Spirituality/4.795604395604396']","['Culture', 'Mind', 'Spirituality']",15.658516483516486,0.6666666666666666,0.0
Clarisse Hahn,"Prisons is part of a series of videos, entitled Our Body is a Weapon, representing individuals who affirm the body as a place of political and social resistance. In this video, two young women used their bodies as a weapon of war, participating in a hunger strike in Turkish prisons in the year 2000. This hunger strike was violently repressed by the army. Between portraits and archive images, this video is a reflection on the resistance and sacrifice of individuals against the violence of the State. According to Giovanna Zapperi, ‘The tensions taking place between those who occupy the surface of the image and the eye that gazes on them constitute the heart of Clarisse Hahn’s reflection.’ The title of the series repeats that of the video, in which a Turkish-Kurdish communist militant, disabled following a fast to death, says: “our body is a weapon, a loaded rifle that fires for victory.”","Clarisse Hahn (born in 1973) lives and works in Paris. Through her films, photographs and video installations, Hahn continues a documentary research on communities, behavioral codes and the social role of the body. Is the body perceived in society? How can the body be used or exploited according to geographical regions and political needs?

Tarik Kiswanson,"In late 2017, Kiswanson stared working with Vadim, an eleven-year-old Romanian-French boy who he met during castings for a performance. Captivated by what he describes as a “hybrid voice, one that belonged everywhere and nowhere all at once”, he began working with Vadim on a regular basis. Over the course of four months, Kiswanson interviewed Vadim on a multitude of subjects concerning the human condition: from his beliefs on death, his thoughts on growing up and becoming an adult, what it feels like to breathe, talk, move and above all, what it means to be born between several cultures and languages. Using this raw recorded material as research, Kiswanson wrote a 23-page poem which he titled Vadim. Structured as an interview between the artist and Vadim himself, the poem runs on a 27 minute loop from four speakers spaced out as to create a square. The voices pull the spectators’ attention in different directions, creating a feeling of disorientation, displacement and instability. In this sound piece, the artist and the boy travel through time, constantly moving between a multitude of places: from the desert to the schoolyard, back in time to Jerusalem 1954 and back to the present in the music room at Vadim’s middle school. The voices of the artist and the young boy entwine, multiply, and at times cancel each other out. The work can be seen as an intimate self-portrait which finds utmost relevance in the contemporary context of migration and displacement.","Tarik Kiswanson is a Palestinian-Swedish artist, poet and writer based in Paris. His family exiled from Jerusalem to North Africa, and later to Jordan before finally arriving in Sweden in the beginning of the 1980s. Kiswanson studied in London and Paris and today splits his time between Europe and the Middle East. His identity is one defined by multiple cultures. His work stems from his own condition of being a first-generation immigrant shaped by the aftermath of the diaspora. It’s about living with the sensation of not belonging anywhere. Throughout his life, he has explored the question of identity, displacement, desire and the ‘in-between’ through writing and sculpture.  The artist has described his work—which encompasses sculpture, writing, performance, sound, and video—as being “the border, the window between the iris and the world outside.” The window is less a demarcation between two opposed realms than a portal—a space between. This dynamic interstitial space nurtures his practice and animates his reflections on the human condition. His work evinces an engagement with the poetics of métissage: a means of writing and surviving between multiple conditions and contexts. Notions of rootlessness, regeneration, and renewal are recurring themes in Kiswanson’s oeuvre. His practice examines questions of displacement and interstitiality that specifically relate to the context of what is lost and what is gained, in the first generation of migration. He conceives works that articulate a fluid “politics of identity”, that encompasses the various collisions of culture that have shaped both his personal experience and artistic practice. His body of work can be understood as a cosmology of related conceptual families, each exploring variations on themes like refraction, multiplication, disintegration, hybridity, and polyphony through their own distinct language.",Vadim,Europe,"['male_child.n.01', 'voice.n.01', 'square.n.01', 'interview.n.01', 'bear.v.01', 'times.n.01', 'late.a.01', 'school.n.01', 'time.n.01', 'music.n.01', 'attention.n.01', 'death.n.01', 'language.n.01', 'sound.n.01', 'contemporary.s.01', 'context.n.01', 'performance.n.01', 'human.a.01', 'culture.n.01', 'make.v.03', 'material.n.01', 'spectator.n.01', 'piece.n.01']","['humanity.n.01', 'young_person.n.01', 'language.n.01', 'culture.n.01', 'supplanting.n.01', 'migration.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/vadim.png,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/vadim-300x214.png,https://kadist.org/work/vadim/,"['Politics/4.525146198830409', 'Cultural/2.6666666666666665', 'Individual_Personal/2.370537958773253']","['Politics', 'Cultural', 'Individual_Personal']",9.562350824270329,"['Geopolitics/3.725146198830409', 'Language/2.6666666666666665', 'Time/1.6985294117647058']","['Geopolitics', 'Language', 'Time']",8.090342277261781,"['Individual_Personal/8.136630036630036', 'Material_Physical/6.677655677655678', 'Cultural/6.315262515262516']","['Individual_Personal', 'Material_Physical', 'Cultural']",21.129548229548227,"['Time/4.216117216117216', 'Arts/2.857142857142857', 'Community/2.6783216783216783']","['Time', 'Arts', 'Community']",9.751581751581751,0.6666666666666666,0.3333333333333333
Korakrit Arunanondchai,"His untitled paintings express his concern regarding perception in abstract form. Made with bleached denim, stock images of flames and gold leaf, these works embody “human cultures as ghosts.” The gold serves as a reminder of religious paintings, and the denim as emblematic of Western capitalist waste. When describing his paintings, the artist states, “The idea of what Painting is or could be became somehow akin to the image of the earth, as seen from above, from the viewpoint of a drone or a spirit. As the denim burns away so begins an upload of ourselves to a greater network where we are no longer human.”","Born in 1986 in Bangkok, Thailand, Korakrit Arunanondchai now lives and works in New York and Bangkok. Arunanondchai combines music, fashion, painting, sculpture, performance and video in both cinematic and biographic manner. At the core of his practice is narrative-based video that parallels his life, for which he features and collaborates with friends and family.     His practice is informed by Eastern and Western cultural data that he collects, appropriates and transforms. In one 23-minute video, the audience may encounter YouTube footage of Western artists making action paintings, juxtaposed with a body-painting performance by a go-go dancer on Thailand’s Got Talent. The artist works with metaphors and symbolic characters, while figures from Buddhism also appear regularly. One such returning character is the drone, used as a tool in many of his films to create what he calls “a spirit viewpoint,” like the Garuda, a divine bird in Buddhist mythology that can morph into human form.  Korakrit Arunanondchai aims to represent the geo-historical moment of the Anthropocene; the term ‘history’ found in his titles draws on both cultural and geological perspectives, concerning himself with the earth’s evolution from a post-human and animist point of view. “We look at ourselves through what is left over after the upload: strands of DNA and human cultures as ghosts,” states the artist enigmatically.",Untitled (History painting),Asia,"['human.a.01', 'ghost.n.01', 'spirit.n.01', 'network.n.01', 'western.a.01', 'religious.s.01', 'percept.n.01', 'earth.n.01', 'abstract.a.01', 'image.n.01', 'idea.n.01', 'culture.n.01', 'form.n.01']","['abstract.s.02', 'painting.n.01', 'religion.n.02', 'earth.n.01', 'mythology.n.01', 'capitalism.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Korakrit-Arunanondchai-painting.jpeg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Korakrit-Arunanondchai-painting-219x300.jpeg,https://kadist.org/work/untitled-history-painting/,"['Cultural/6.054084967320261', 'Material_Physical/5.147514619883041', 'Individual_Personal/2.8']","['Cultural', 'Material_Physical', 'Individual_Personal']",14.001599587203302,"['Arts/4.476307189542483', 'Space/2.475', 'Spirituality/2.0']","['Arts', 'Space', 'Spirituality']",8.951307189542483,"['Individual_Personal/23.474292374292382', 'Cultural/14.67936507936508', 'Material_Physical/7.442032967032967']","['Individual_Personal', 'Cultural', 'Material_Physical']",45.595690420690424,"['Mind/9.8989010989011', 'Culture/7.884615384615384', 'Values/5.12967032967033']","['Mind', 'Culture', 'Values']",22.91318681318681,1.0,0.0
Joana Hadjithomas & Khalil Joreige,"Produced for the Prix Marcel Duchamp and presented at the Centre Pompidou in October 2017, the installation Uncomformities is comprised of photographs, archaeological drawings, and narratives, based on the analysis of core samples from different sites in Beirut, Paris and Athens. The work questions how, at a time when traces and memories no longer exist, and the earth remains the only witness of our past, history is produced, and how the stories of our civilization are written and told.

Joana Hadjithomas & Khalil Joreige,"Produced for the Prix Marcel Duchamp and presented at the Centre Pompidou in October 2017, the installation Unconformities is comprised of photographs, archaeological drawings, and narratives, based on the analysis of core samples from different sites in Beirut, Paris and Athens. The work questions how, at a time when traces and memories no longer exist, and the earth remains the only witness of our past, history is produced, and how the stories of our civilization are written and told.

Christina Quarles,"The title of the painting refers to the fact that the figure’s behind is raised upwards and the face is found at the bottom of the painting, thus inverting the way in which people are normally seen. Bottom’s up is also a pun, a nod to the English toast. Quarles draws on a number of sources of inspiration, including comic book imagery, the influence of which sits alongside elements of her practice informed by life drawing classes. She begins a painting by making gestural marks which she then photographs before playing with the image on a computer. These gestures retain a muscle memory from her life-drawing practice, coalescing into a figure. She then experiments with different kinds of decorative grids and backgrounds before returning to paint the resulting image. In this painting the artist refers to two different treatments of space, three dimensional on the right and flat or two dimensional on the left. The paint itself is highly textured in places and flat in others. The decorative quality of the painting mimics, in some respects, cubist mark-making reminiscent of Picasso; there is a gravitational pull on both the image and the paint as the figure and paint are dragged down the canvas. The synthetic manner in which Quarles constructs the painting is belied by the overall painterly qualities.","Christina Quarles’ work is concerned with the female body. Not so much what it looks like, but what it feels like to inhabit it. She makes images in which the body is fragmented, distorted, stretched out of shape, occupying impossible spaces and sliding through dimensions and time. The resulting images have something of a collaged look and are somewhat otherworldly, they retain enough reference to reality however to suggest bodily and sexual encounters that question gender and identity. As a lesbian who is black but often mistaken for white, Quarles paints self-referentially. There is a strong sensual nature to the work, giving it an air of neo-surrealism.",Bottoms Up,Americas,"['paint.n.01', 'quality.n.01', 'figure.n.01', 'practice.n.01', 'grid.n.01', 'imagination.n.02', 'kind.n.01', 'image.n.01', 'class.n.01', 'background.n.01', 'gesture.n.01', 'book.n.01', 'beginning.n.04', 'elements.n.01', 'memory.n.01', 'drawing.n.01', 'manner.n.01', 'people.n.01', 'title.n.01', 'life.n.01', 'space.n.01']","['surface.n.01', 'texture.n.04', 'technology.n.01', 'body.n.01', 'gender.n.01', 'identity.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/bottoms-up2-copie.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/bottoms-up2-copie-251x300.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/bottoms-up/,"['Material_Physical/10.684615384615386', 'Cultural/10.60814479638009', 'Individual_Personal/5.7979797979797985']","['Material_Physical', 'Cultural', 'Individual_Personal']",27.090739978975275,"['Space/6.346153846153846', 'Identity/4.797979797979798', 'Arts/4.084213172448466']","['Space', 'Identity', 'Arts']",15.228346816582109,"['Cultural/28.216738387545366', 'Individual_Personal/23.51296416002299', 'Society/17.676526724049946']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Society']",69.4062292716183,"['Mind/8.27524240465417', 'Culture/7.280860805860806', 'Media/5.958852258852258']","['Mind', 'Culture', 'Media']",21.514955469367234,0.6666666666666666,0.0
Haegue Yang,"A steel clothing rack adorned with turbine vents, Moroccan vintage jewelry, pinecones and knitting yarn, these heterogeneous elements are used here to create an exotic yet undefined identity within the work. Following Haegue Yang’s 2010 anthropomorphic series Medicine Men, this sculpture appears as a shamanic objet or being. It is mobile and can be activated. One can turn the turbine vents or play the bells to liberate the work’s musical and magical potential. Yang’s work is strewn with performative elements: “it rolls or can be pushed, it folds up, it hangs, floats, dangles, or swings, it rustles, makes sound, or smells.” In this work, nothing is static; everything suggests movement and an unfurling, momentous display of contradiction and transformation.","Haegue Yang is one of the leading international artists of her generation. From mundane objects and materials such as venetian blinds, theatrical and decorative lights, infrared heaters, scent emitters, and fans, Yang creates complex and nuanced installations that are informed by poetry, politics, and human emotions. Her works explore hidden spaces that might be considered marginal, but to the artist constitute profound backdrops for understanding vulnerable sites where informal development can occur. In her works, artificial approximations of sensual experiences — heat, light, smell, and humidity—conjure other places, other people. Yang’s work captivates precisely because of its ambiguity, which is rooted as much in the conceptual art of the 1960s and 1970s as it is in current theoretical discourses.",Knotty Spell in Windy Drapes,Asia,"['elements.n.01', 'transformation.n.01', 'display.n.01', 'sound.n.01', 'identity.n.01', 'motion.n.03', 'make.v.03', 'sculpture.n.01', 'series.n.01']","['motion.n.03', 'object.n.01', 'culture.n.01', 'sculpture.n.02', 'materiality.n.02', 'anthropology.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/ficheoeuvre-HY1610-2.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/ficheoeuvre-HY1610-2-188x300.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/knotty-spell-in-windy-drapes/,"['Cultural/18.63304339279572', 'Material_Physical/9.305916305916305', 'Society/6.908058917346843']","['Cultural', 'Material_Physical', 'Society']",34.84701861605887,"['Arts/9.605503955968354', 'Geopolitics/4.821661998132586', 'History/3.508771929824561']","['Arts', 'Geopolitics', 'History']",17.9359378839255,"['Individual_Personal/7.455122655122656', 'Cultural/5.744281045751634', 'Politics/4.802614379084967']","['Individual_Personal', 'Cultural', 'Politics']",18.002018079959257,"['Identity/4.797979797979798', 'Arts/4.14297385620915', 'Geopolitics/3.2026143790849675']","['Identity', 'Arts', 'Geopolitics']",12.143568033273915,0.3333333333333333,0.6666666666666666
Uche Okpa-Iroha,"In the fictional narrative Plantation Boy (2012), Irhoa places himself inside imagery from Francis Ford Coppola’s seminal The Godfather (1972). Inflected with humor, the series examines race in society. According to the artist, the 40 images collectively question structures of power and the hegemony of Western culture. This détournement of a cult film demonstrates the extent to which our collective imaginary is manipulated by image and representation. This specific piece marks a major conceptual pivot within the artist’s oeuvre, in terms of both composition and performative character. The work reveals that which was once hidden from view— inequalities of the past and the present. This allows the artist to question representative stereotypes of identity, placing them at the heart of the image. This symbolic presence gives way to a form of recognition. The magical quality of the photographic medium provides the means to confront both history and fiction through reconstruction and re-appropriation.","Uche Okpa Iroha documents the living conditions of those on the margins of society. Beginning his career as a photojournalist in 2005, his striking, double exposed and black and white images depict moving bodies overlaid with natural light, producing images with great depth. He creates atmospheric shots in which questions of body representation become a political paradigm for reading the image. If the omnipresent flux of images in our daily lives reinvents, influences and modifies our self perception as well as our perception of others, then Uche Okpa Irhoa re-appropriates such given identities as a means of critiquing the oversaturation of unnuanced images. He also uses the photographic medium as a means of proposing new performative or choreographed narratives. His work sits at the intersection between fiction and sociology, seeking to deconstruct often truncated visual references perpetuated by the media. He is the director of the experimental Njele Art Station in Harare Zimbabwe and is co-founder of the Invisible Borders collective.",The Plantation Boy,Middle East & Africa,"['race.n.01', 'male_child.n.01', 'confront.v.01', 'imagination.n.02', 'fictional.a.01', 'western.a.01', 'conceptual.s.01', 'image.n.01', 'specific.a.01', 'symbolic.a.01', 'fiction.n.01', 'quality.n.01', 'corporate.s.03', 'presence.n.01', 'narrative.s.01', 'structure.n.01', 'society.n.01', 'composition.n.01', 'photographic.a.01', 'representation.n.01', 'identity.n.01', 'power.n.01', 'fictional_character.n.01', 'medium.n.01', 'culture.n.01']","['wit.n.01', 'race.n.03', 'society.n.01', 'power.n.01', 'hegemony.n.01', 'representation.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/18.PA_.MA_.30.1jpg.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/18.PA_.MA_.30.1jpg-300x169.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/the-plantation-boy/,"['Individual_Personal/14.066666666666672', 'Cultural/6.695604395604395', 'Politics/4.914219114219114']","['Individual_Personal', 'Cultural', 'Politics']",25.676490176490184,"['Mind/4.9282051282051285', 'Culture/3.269230769230769', 'Power/2.511655011655012']","['Mind', 'Culture', 'Power']",10.70909090909091,"['Cultural/40.819961574373316', 'Individual_Personal/32.83777186865422', 'Material_Physical/14.385450806503442']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Material_Physical']",88.04318424953098,"['Mind/11.712044817927174', 'Media/10.22341628959276', 'Fantasy/9.625116713352007']","['Mind', 'Media', 'Fantasy']",31.56057782087194,0.6666666666666666,0.3333333333333333
siren eun young jung,"Lyrics 1,2,3 is part of the Yeosung Gukgeuk series. The work closely follows first and second generations of Yeosung Gukgeuk actresses, who later became an important source of inspiration for the artist.  Formally, this genre of theatre draws from Westernized aspects of traditional Korean music performance as well as from adaptations of pansori, a Korean genre of musical storytelling, to create what could be called a staged version of traditional Korean opera. Yeosung gukgeuk was widely popular in the 1950s before and after the Korean War. Yet, though yeosung gukgeuk met considerable success, it gradually lost momentum after the 1960s. Today yeosung gukgeuk is almost extinct alive because it’s not being taught or invested in. Siren eun young jung’s  video work, Lyrics 1,2,3 analyzes and reassembles images of the interiors and exteriors of the stages that were once occupied by first and second generation female Gukgeuk actresses So-ja Lee, Young-suk Cho, and Deung-woo Lee. Widely known as gadaggi, a villainous supporting role, sammai, a skilled person’s supporting role, and nimai, a leading role, these outstanding actresses playing male characters are seen getting ready offstage for their onstage performance. The work highlights their affection for the stage by focusing on their daily activities offstage, wandering through landscapes, discovering object, remembering past moments, acting, and singing.","With a practice deeply engaged with feminism and LGBT rights issues, siren eun young jung reveals the subversive power of traditional culture, one unknown in Korean modernization period, and provides unique perspectives and documentation of important communities. Through her long-term research projects bridging different generations of women, she keenly addresses questions of gender as a norm of “becoming.” Her early works have examined the struggles of a younger generation of women against androcentrism and violent patriarchy. Her subsequent projects have addressed issues surrounding environment change, human rights, activism, and homosexual rights.  Her pivotal work Yeosung Gukguek Project (2008–) engages the existing queer community in South Korea by focusing on Yeosung Gukguek, an all female traditional theatre genre existing since the 1950s, after the Korean War. The ongoing project tells an empowering story of gender-becoming in the mid 20th century. Unveiling traditional yet subversive narratives that existed during the transitional period of a country moving towards a modern society and challenging the myth of Korean “andro-modernization” achieved by a rapid masculinism of national development.","Lyrics 1,2,3",Asia,"['function.n.03', 'phase.n.01', 'coevals.n.01', 'traditional.a.01', 'performance.n.01', 'version.n.01', 'activity.n.01', 'music.n.01', 'aspect.n.01', 'daily.s.01', 'popular.a.01', 'name.v.01', 'person.n.01', 'beginning.n.04', 'war.n.01', 'moment.n.01', 'fictional_character.n.01', 'make.v.03', 'landscape.n.01', 'object.n.01', 'video.n.01', 'series.n.01']","['theater.n.01', 'custom.n.02', 'westernization.n.01', 'feminist_movement.n.01', 'gay.s.06', 'music.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/004.png,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/004-300x169.png,https://kadist.org/work/lyrics-123/,"['Society/5.035897435897436', 'Cultural/4.585407239819005', 'Individual_Personal/1.8']","['Society', 'Cultural', 'Individual_Personal']",11.421304675716442,"['Arts/3.8161764705882355', 'History/3.466666666666667', 'Urbanization/1.5692307692307694']","['Arts', 'History', 'Urbanization']",8.852073906485671,"['Cultural/24.215867629102927', 'Society/21.89354844501904', 'Individual_Personal/14.646692523163116']","['Cultural', 'Society', 'Individual_Personal']",60.756108597285085,"['Arts/10.14065934065934', 'Spirituality/6.619291819291819', 'War/5.145604395604395']","['Arts', 'Spirituality', 'War']",21.90555555555555,1.0,0.3333333333333333
Danielle Dean,"In 2003, Nike released a pair of red and black sneakers (the Dunk Low Pro SB) that were marketed as “vampire” sneakers. Interested in how a large corporation co-opted a historical fiction (the vampire), in addition to the traditional red and black colors of radical politics and the avant-garde, Danielle Dean’s work True Red considers how capitalism can gentrify notions of radicality and the mutable nature of advertising.  Set to a low-pitched ominous soundtrack, the video begins with what looks like an oozing pool of blood, from which a vampire sneaker emerges. Its black “swoosh” melts off it’s side and mutates into a bat, which then morphs into a dense puddle of oil, then a castle, and then into a group of factory assembly line workers. As the animation shifts, the boundaries between objects break down and merge, suggesting hybrid forms and the capacity for objects to seemingly acquire a life of their own.  True Red relates to Dean’s ongoing interest in how advertising shapes subjects, and what our relationship and agency is in circulating these objects. Sneakers themselves are symbols of cachet and power in some communities and subcultures. The work also gestures to Nike’s vampiric accumulation of wealth and the violence against workers in China who produce their sneakers. A vampire could also be regarded as a colonial subject, if a vampire bites you, you either die or become a vampire.

Fabien Giraud & Raphael Siboni,"– In which an intelligence going back to its place of origin discovers the agony of gods on which it thrives –     Seventh and last episode of The Unmanned, “a flood” is set in 1542 as the first conquistadors enter the land later to be known as the Silicon Valley. Mining the colonial past of the region, and entirely generated and edited with an autonomous artificial intelligence system, this film for and by machines only features the return  of an intelligence to its place of origin and the death of the animal gods who used to live in it. Closing the series onto itself with a machine trained solely on its first episode (“2045 – The Death of Ray Kurzweil”), it shows the wandering of an inhuman vision trying to revive meaning by recognizing itself on the god’s corpses.  The Unmanned, is composed of several 26min episodes, it is a fictional documentary about the history of humanity faced with technology acceleration. Each episode dramatizes a “singular” encounter between man and machine. Each episode is filmed with a different camera (a preprogrammed machine or a drone). The title The Unmanned – in French, ‘an uninhabited machine’ highlights perfectly the subject and the method used by the artists.  In coproduction with Casino Luxembourg and KADIST and with the support of Fondation d’Entreprise Ricard, CNC – DICRéAM – Ministère de la Culture et de la Communication, and Institut Français – Consulat Général de France à San Francisco.","Fabien Giraud (born in 1980) and Raphael Siboni (born in 1981) live and work in Paris, France","1542-a flood (""The Unmanned"" series)",Europe,"['episode.n.01', 'machine.n.01', 'death.n.01', 'beginning.n.04', 'documentary.n.01', 'method.n.01', 'film.v.01', 'region.n.01', 'fictional.a.01', 'brush.n.06', 'put.v.01', 'technology.n.01', 'land.n.01', 'vision.n.01', 'compose.v.01', 'meaning.n.01', 'artist.n.01', 'subject.n.01', 'camera.n.01', 'culture.n.01', 'title.n.01', 'history.n.01', 'movie.n.01']","['colonialism.n.01', 'artificial_intelligence.n.01', 'machine.n.01', 'humanity.n.01', 'technology.n.01', 'history.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/1542-–-a-flood-e1585846589558.png,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/1542-–-a-flood-300x169.png,https://kadist.org/work/1542-a-flood-serie-the-unmanned/,"['Cultural/17.37107843137255', 'Society/6.783094992382917', 'Politics/2.5328025947220993']","['Cultural', 'Society', 'Politics']",26.686976018477566,"['Technology/10.947549019607845', 'Arts/4.06797385620915', 'Inequality/2.5328025947220993']","['Technology', 'Arts', 'Inequality']",17.548325470539094,"['Cultural/24.014822595704953', 'Material_Physical/13.48676617500147', 'Society/6.918027560674619']","['Cultural', 'Material_Physical', 'Society']",44.419616331381036,"['Arts/6.9107376283846875', 'Technology/6.480882352941176', 'Media/5.7748366013071895']","['Arts', 'Technology', 'Media']",19.166456582633053,0.6666666666666666,0.6666666666666666
Yogesh Barve,"Global? 1 & 2 documents an annual event during which people of a particular religious group gather around Jejuri in Maharashtra, India. The six-day festival, from the first to sixth lunar day of the bright fortnight of the Hindu month of Margashirsha is celebrated to allow the meeting of the principle God (Khandoba) with other gods carried from different homes of the patrons who take them back at the end of the ceremony. It is a common belief by ancestral stories that the gods existed in this region. The process of worship is called Tali Bhamdara. During this ritual, the participants try to reach the metaphysical stage and state. The music, repetition and the colors hypnotize the viewer who actively attempts to understand and decipher the rite of escape. Cultural globalization, potential exchanges and experience remains suspended in this space. Hypnosis and the state of being possessed are paralleled with the contemporary virtual environments and the Internet. In using a traditional event of Indian tradition and crossing aesthetic codes of transfixion, belief and hypnotization, Barve raises questions of new forms of colonization.","Yogesh Barve (b. 1989, Mumbai, India) is a contemporary multimodal artist based in Mumbai, India. Employing a range of artistic materials, including found objects and digital technologies including his mobile phone camera in his multimedia installations, his work examines social and cultural experiences of equality/inequality, the outsider/insider, and the uninvited/the invited. His videos act as spontaneous testimonies to his instinctive visual sense. A common thread crosses each of his works: the questioning of our cultural framework of thought. Opening new aesthetic points of view to deal with social phenomena, unlearning/learning, building/deconstructing and binary opposition to unlock all anchored stereotypes is central to Barve’s oeuvre. Seeking to democratize technology, its accessibility and its simplicity as an act of decolonization, the artist’s work is singularly at the forefront of divisive frontiers.",“Global?” 1 & “Global?” 2,Unspecified,"['event.n.01', 'potential.a.01', 'region.n.01', 'repeat.n.01', 'religious.s.01', 'phase.n.01', 'exchange.n.01', 'common.a.01', 'aesthetic.a.01', 'music.n.01', 'day.n.01', 'colors.n.01', 'traditional.a.01', 'name.v.01', 'tradition.n.01', 'document.n.01', 'environment.n.01', 'contemporary.s.01', 'cultural.a.01', 'experience.n.01', 'procedure.n.01', 'question.n.01', 'people.n.01', 'spectator.n.01', 'narrative.n.01']","['religion.n.02', 'ceremony.n.01', 'ritual.n.01', 'colonization.n.01', 'hypnosis.n.01', 'metaphysical.s.02']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/global_2.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/global_2-300x170.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/global-1-global-2/,"['Society/7.613114989585577', 'Individual_Personal/4.483516483516484', 'Material_Physical/3.317460317460317']","['Society', 'Individual_Personal', 'Material_Physical']",15.414091790562377,"['Power/2.307692307692308', 'Spirituality/2.0', 'Culture/1.8235294117647058']","['Power', 'Spirituality', 'Culture']",6.131221719457014,"['Cultural/27.23408552232083', 'Individual_Personal/21.445054945054956', 'Material_Physical/15.088023088023089']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Material_Physical']",63.76716355539888,"['Culture/9.990476190476192', 'Time/6.714219114219115', 'Mind/6.3128205128205135']","['Culture', 'Time', 'Mind']",23.01751581751582,0.6666666666666666,0.3333333333333333
Amy Balkin,"Data mining is a computer software process that can involve the neutral or benign analyzing of internet data for patterns, however, it can also imply the more sinister activities of surveillance or subject-based information gathering. Amy Balkin’s neon sculpture I (heart) Data Mining, takes on this issue by revealing the acronyms or abbreviations of both technology companies and government bodies that have either profited from data mining, or have used it to political ends. The culprits include Facebook, Investigative Data Warehouse, Apple Computer, The Department of Homeland Security, Narus, Target, and Twitter. As the colorful neon text directs  us to these organizations, a second layer of neon text reading ‘I (heart) Data Mining’ flickers on and off. Despite the existence of various landmark cases — from the dozens of civil lawsuits against the telecommunications giant AT&T for providing the NSA (National Security Agency’s) with its customers’ phone and Internet communications for data-mining, to the targeting and tracking of individuals for commercial or political purposes — most internet users have little knowledge of these programs that capture and process the information traveling through computer networks. Balkin’s piece reflects on the sensitive and complex nature of privacy and surveillance and the ethical binds that corporations and government bodies constantly face in a digital era.","Based in San Francisco, Amy Balkin’s various long-term projects respond to society’s relationship to the land, the atmosphere, the ocean and other natural resources, and how these resources have been used and valued. Often explicitly critical of the economic and political forces that frame these resources, she thinks beyond borders and nation-states to ask global questions about their allocation and ownership. Several of her projects engage with or document individuals and communities that fight for social and environmental justice. Whether through creating a public archive of objects from places that will disappear from global warming; offering an environmental justice audio tour set up near a highway; or creating a “clean air park” with emission credits the artist purchases; the thread that runs throughout is a questioning of who is entitled to nominate and enforce protections around land and the people who will benefit from it.",I (heart) Data Mining,Americas,"['surveillance.n.01', 'government.n.01', 'political.a.01', 'body.n.01', 'telephone.n.01', 'cognition.n.01', 'gathering.n.01', 'company.n.01', 'being.n.01', 'purpose.n.01', 'plan.n.01', 'network.n.01', 'activity.n.01', 'form.n.03', 'era.n.01', 'technology.n.01', 'digital.a.01', 'layer.n.01', 'complex.a.01', 'issue.n.01', 'person.n.01', 'nature.n.01', 'procedure.n.01', 'sculpture.n.01', 'piece.n.01']","['data_mining.n.01', 'wiretap.n.01', 'surveillance.n.01', 'privacy.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IheartDataMining-on2.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IheartDataMining-on2-300x229.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/i-heart-data-mining/,"['Politics/1.8421052631578947', 'Society/1.6013071895424837']","['Politics', 'Society']",3.4434124527003784,"['Politics/1.8421052631578947', 'Economy/1.6013071895424837']","['Politics', 'Economy']",3.4434124527003784,"['Cultural/60.39824929971985', 'Individual_Personal/46.28204018204017', 'Society/36.083083583083585']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Society']",142.7633730648436,"['Arts/17.1107035121741', 'Culture/16.868986568986575', 'Mind/15.070085470085473']","['Arts', 'Culture', 'Mind']",49.04977555124615,0.4,0.0
Keith Tyson,"The work of Keith Tyson is concerned with an interest in generative systems, and embraces the complexity and interconnectedness of existence. Philosophical problems such as the nature of causality, the roles of probability and design in human experience, and the limits and possibilities of human knowledge, animate much of his work.  Language as a coded system, as a representation medium, but also as something that generates a whole variety of realities also plays a central role. The heterotopias of the real and imagined, near and far, thinkable and inconceivable converge and find meaning. Using phrases, along with a list of them that could be continued ad infinitum, Keith Tyson creates images that cause the distant and the near, the fictitious and the real to operate from within a location. His media include painting, drawing and installation. His exhibits are hybrid forms, they are games, images, machines, mechanisms that offer places from which literature, inventories, phenomena spread out into spheres that are infinite in both space and time. In Tyson’s work the idea of dimensions play out in terms of prolongation of time and space, and the idea of breadth and compression. Tyson is not so much concerned with representation rather he is interested in subject of machines, mechanisms and engines that confront our models for handling reality and the re-evaluation of our subjective positions.

Barry McGee,"Barry McGee’s Untitled is a collection of roughly fifty, framed photographs, paintings, and text pieces clustered together in corner. Its tiled effect can perhaps be seen as a vertical Carl Andre work and also bears some resemblance to another work in the Kadist Collection, Jedediah Caesar’s JCA-25-SC.

Jedediah Caesar,"For Untitled, Caesar encased recycled objects such as scraps of plywood, paper or cloth in resin and then cut and reassembled the pieces into abstract forms. This technical rework allows for a clinical inspection of the material contents of the piece and the resulting slanted industrial monolith echoes minimalist sculpture, although with a different expressive texture. Indeed, Untitled can be seen as a contemporary pyramid with a painterly surface. Its transparency reveals that the base and the top have been created out of a single cast piece cleanly bisected into two fragments which were subsequently placed—as if in a mirror—so that both sides of the split are visible.","Jedediah Caesar is more interested in the materials and the process of making a work than in the actual final aesthetic product.

Lynn Hershman Leeson,"Tania Libre is a film by Lynn Hershman Leeson centered around renowned artist Tania Bruguera and her experience as a political artist and activist under the repressive government of her native Cuba. The film begins with the voice of Tilda Swinton narrating a manifesto of artists’ rights written by Bruguera in which she expresses her views on art, our universal right to both enjoy and create art, and the duty that artists have to dissent. The film then captures a series of therapy sessions between Bruguera and Dr. Frank M. Ochberg—the founding father of trauma therapy, particularly PTSD and Stockholm Syndrome—where Bruguera describes with great candor and earnestness several traumatic experiences such as the betrayal by her father who handed her to Cuban secret service, and her imprisonment in Havana years later after advocating for freedom of expression. Their conversations expose an intimate yet profound analysis of Cuba, surveillance and the politics of repression embedded in government and family structures.","Lynn Hershman Leeson is a celebrated Bay Area artist and filmmaker internationally renowned for her pioneering use of new technologies to explore key social issues. Her prolific body of work spans over four decades: from her early conceptual and performance works where she constructed an ‘official’ civilian record for her alter ego Roberta Breitmore, to her more recent works that intersect with the field of science to explore themes of identity, privacy, surveillance and the complex relationship between humans and technology, and the real and the virtual world. Hershman Leeson also addresses these key themes through her filmmaking, which is highly idiosyncratic and socially engaged.

Jess,"The Antique Gem is a collage by Jess comprised of eight fantastical scenes featuring the Cupid as its central protagonist. The title of the work and the oval shape of these scenes, refer to ancient engraved gems, a form of fine art dating back thousands of years B.C. Underneath each of the scenes we can also see lines from a poem, which the artist cut out of the book Gems: Selected from the Antique—a 1804 publication by British painter and illustrator Richard Dagley that is considered an important document for the study of engraved gems and a historical artifact itself. The original poem, as Dagley explains in the publication, is an ancient Greek epigram by Aulus Licinius Archias found engraved in a sardonyx (a variety of rock-forming mineral) gem depicting the figure of Cupid curbing a lion. Echoing the poem and the gem itself, Jess’ collage typifies the power of love, as we see Cupid (or Eros) subjugating all nature—a lion, giant insects, and other surreal characters among them. Jess’ The Antique Gem connects antiquity to the present by bringing together various interpretations of one of the most essential human emotions: love.","Jess Collins (most commonly known as Jess), is a celebrated San Francisco artist known for his highly symbolic paintings and layered collages that combine imagery from mythology, alchemy, popular culture and the male body. He originally studied chemistry, and after being drafted into the military at a young age, he worked in a plutonium mining project for manufacturing atomic bombs, and later in a project focusing on atomic energy. His growing concern for the threat that atomic weaponry posed to our planet is said to be one of the factors that led him to abandon his work as a scientist to pursue art full-time. Jess then became a pivotal figure of the Bay Area’s artistic and literary scene, not only through his work as an artist but through his lifelong romantic partnership and artistic collaboration with postwar American poet Robert Duncan. Akin to Duncan’s idiosyncratic poems, Jess’ paintings draw on myth, occultism and religion, often expressed through the dense layering of found images sourced from book illustrations and comic strips that the artist salvaged during his frequent walks around San Francisco’s thrift stores and book shops.",The Antique Gem,Americas,"['love.n.01', 'collage.n.01', 'scene.n.01', 'artifact.n.01', 'british.a.01', 'ancient.s.01', 'supporter.n.01', 'survey.n.01', 'see.v.05', 'interpretation.n.01', 'line.n.01', 'original.s.01', 'document.n.01', 'book.n.01', 'cardinal.s.01', 'shape.n.01', 'historical.a.01', 'power.n.01', 'fictional_character.n.01', 'human.a.01', 'figure.n.01', 'title.n.01', 'form.n.01']","['mythology.n.01', 'cupid.n.01', 'eros.n.01', 'love.n.01', 'poem.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_Jess_The-Antique-Gem-WEB.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_Jess_The-Antique-Gem-WEB-300x207.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/the-antique-gem/,"['Individual_Personal/15.130525030525032', 'Cultural/5.5648351648351655', 'Society/2.4835164835164836']","['Individual_Personal', 'Cultural', 'Society']",23.178876678876684,"['Emotion/10.686080586080587', 'Spirituality/3.644444444444445', 'Violence/2.4835164835164836']","['Emotion', 'Spirituality', 'Violence']",16.814041514041513,"['Cultural/41.238492837086184', 'Individual_Personal/22.988675686198917', 'Society/11.699322899322901']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Society']",75.926491422608,"['Arts/11.99757758581288', 'Emotion/10.686080586080587', 'Media/7.4587606837606835']","['Arts', 'Emotion', 'Media']",30.142418855654153,1.0,0.3333333333333333
Audra Knutson,"Audra Knutson’s work,The Death, is a hand-pulled linocut print inspired by Rainer Maria Rilke’s novel The Notebooks of Malte Laurids Brigge. Set in what appears to be a pathway inside a small town, the scene features two central figures: a man seated on a chair with a skull on his lap, and a girl writing the message ‘voilà votre mort, monsieur’ on a nearby wall. The girl’s message echoes the expression in the man’s face, who appears resigned or as described by Knutson “accepting death or a monotony in living, and not embracing beauty.” The large areas of solid ink in contrast with the delicate linework create a sense of theatricality and drama, and add to the mysterious and surreal nature of the scene. As with many of her pieces, this work is interrelated with the print The Oblivion, and are both part of a series Knutson began in 2005.","Based in San Francisco, Audra Knutson is known for her delicate and intricate works that depict elements from nature as well as scenes and objects from the everyday. Working across printmaking, letterpress printing, bookbinding, painting, drawing, metalsmithing and weaving, her compositions fluctuate between figuration and abstraction and have a distinctive style that considers in equal parts the objects that she depicts as well as the space that surrounds them. In several of her compositions, white, empty areas surround and emphasize vibrant zones of organic geometry, patterns, textures and color. Often suggesting natural formations — from plants and animals to salt crystals, mountains, and rolling waves — Knutson’s works speak of her connection to the natural world. Although some pieces originate from her observation of her surrounds, Knutson also leans on and depicts images and knowledge from books and other artists.

Audra Knutson,"Audra Knutson’s work The Oblivion was carved and printed in conjunction with the print The Death. Also a hand-printed linocut, many of the details in this work are based on photocopies of images sourced by the artist from her local library. At the time she was making these works, she recalls looking at ‘beautiful, sad, timeless and stark photographs taken in old-work segments of Europe and being influenced by their aesthetic and emotional gravitas. In The Oblivion both movement and humans are present yet elusive: objects that are usually in motion appear still (a bicycle, a horse, a burning candle) and demonic-like masks obscure the three figures’ human qualities. There is a darkness and mystery present in both prints, which echoes the irrational nature of the novel by Rainer Maria Rilke, which was a source of inspiration for the series. As with Rilke’s novel, Knutson’s haunting images have an inherent disbelief, solitude, and profound anxiety.","Based in San Francisco, Audra Knutson is known for her delicate and intricate works that depict elements from nature as well as scenes and objects from the everyday.

William E. Jones,"His series, The Golden State, harkens back to his early career and his photographic training. Using a still camera to compose the fifty images of the series, Jones turns his lens on the vernacular architecture of California’s southern region, looking at the iconic and idiosyncratic spaces that define a region.  William E. Jones is a filmmaker, writer, and artist whose interests lie in the circulation of images—images that are broadcast, images that are hidden, and images that become imbedded in our collective consciousness. Jones works with still and moving images as a way to enter social histories, communicate personal narratives, and document cultural phenomena. Jones studied documentary photography under Walker Evans—one of the Farm Security Administration (FSA) photographers who documented American life during the Great Depression—and his works reveal a persistent interest in the power of the photographic image. Jones works fluidly between photography and filmmaking, gathering images and footage from elsewhere to build his intricate narratives.","Los Angeles-based artist and filmmaker William E. Jones appropriates vintage film material that he rearranges into new compositions. Often concerned with the way gay imagery was depicted in 1970s and 1980s, Jones’s early films explore the complex configuration of homosexual identity with a rather nostalgic and romanticized gaze.

Rebecca Quaytman,,"In her work, Rebecca Quaytman displays great interest in the dissolution of the image.  Expressing the progressive disappearance of representation takes various forms. The artist attempts to freeze different temporal strata on one same ground in order to blur visual perception.  Her works are always the result of research that creates links with the historical context of the exhibition space, and take place within her larger body of already existing work which is grouped in chapters.  Quaytman’s investigations in the archives, photographic ones in particular, of the institutions who invite her, are generally the source of the images which are then used in her paintings.  Screen-printed onto wooden panels, in dimensions that respect the golden rule, covered in gesso, reframed, enlarged, sometimes sprinkled with diamond dust, they have something ancient about them. The near pointillist weft recalls the printing techniques of the 1960s and the large pixels in Kara Walker or Wade Guyton’s work.  Though everything is perfectly controlled, our eye hesitates. The archival time spans, the screen-printing, how the work takes its form, the materialization of the object (framing devices) are all superimposed during the ephemeral exhibition, and its aftermath.","T, Chapter 24",Europe,[],"['disappear.v.01', 'dissolution.n.01', 'archival.a.01', 'time.n.01', 'materialization.n.01', 'memory.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/scheme_group-of-two.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/scheme_group-of-two-300x300.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/t-chapter-24/,"['Cultural/4.0307692307692315', 'Individual_Personal/3.3956043956043955', 'Material_Physical/3.3956043956043955']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Material_Physical']",10.821978021978023,"['Mind/2.5384615384615383', 'Culture/2.307692307692308', 'Time/1.7692307692307692']","['Mind', 'Culture', 'Time']",6.615384615384616,[],[],0.0,[],[],0.0,,
Rossella Biscotti,"In a broader sense, the meaning of ‘blackout’ —primarily an electrical failure or momentary interruption, opens up to new organizations, perceptions and different ways of experiencing time and space. Every person caught in a blackout must redefine the potentiality of public space, relate to strangers and invent new temporary forms of organization. A blackout acts as the breaking point of an established order, on a personal level as a loss of consciousness or on a collective level, as the temporary disruption of political institutions for example.  This is a special blackout edition! was conceived in collaboration with the artist Rossella Biscotti in relation to the research on the term ‘blackout’, conducted during her residency at Kadist. Her enquiry in Paris started by looking into the city’s electricity and communication network, while she traced historical references of major power failures such as the New York blackout of 1977.","Departing from social and political history, the work of Rossella Biscotti (b. Molfetta, Italy, 1978) transforms and modifies truth through a variety of mediums: sound, film, sculpture and textile. The artist employs a documentary-styled aesthetic to highlight the impossibility to fully account for a truth told to us and heralds a heterogeneous trans-social theory that asserts multiple realities. Her work questions how objectivity is easily given to historical documents and juridical actions and considers the past as an effective vector of possible change. Biscotti’s work reflects the active role art plays in the construction of contemporary knowledge, while questioning the legitimacy of history and of those by whom it was built.",Blackout,Europe,"['degree.n.01', 'new_york.n.01', 'york.n.01', 'loss.n.01', 'institution.n.01', 'consciousness.n.01', 'network.n.01', 'collaboration.n.01', 'percept.n.01', 'space.n.01', 'paris.n.01', 'relation.n.01', 'corporate.s.03', 'person.n.01', 'personal.a.01', 'public.a.01', 'historical.a.01', 'mention.n.01', 'meaning.n.01', 'power.n.01', 'sense.n.01', 'city.n.01', 'question.n.01', 'political.a.01', 'form.n.01']","['consciousness.n.01', 'break.n.13', 'cognition.n.01', 'legitimacy.n.01', 'history.n.01', 'tracing.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/KAF_Blackout_Edition_72dpi.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/KAF_Blackout_Edition_72dpi-200x300.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/blackout/,"['Cultural/10.940350877192984', 'Individual_Personal/7.718954248366013', 'Society/4.288888888888889']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Society']",22.948194014447886,"['Mind/6.118954248366013', 'Arts/4.362573099415204', 'History/3.488888888888889']","['Mind', 'Arts', 'History']",13.970416236670106,"['Society/16.294823030426745', 'Individual_Personal/13.290627020038787', 'Material_Physical/13.067083243553835']","['Society', 'Individual_Personal', 'Material_Physical']",42.65253329401936,"['Urbanization/8.096044031647747', 'Power/4.968797868797869', 'Land/4.780392156862745']","['Urbanization', 'Power', 'Land']",17.84523405730836,0.6666666666666666,0.0
Eric Baudelaire,"With the war-torn Beirut cityscape as its backdrop—urban alleys, glistening beaches, abandoned buildings—Eric Baudelaire’s complex film, The Ugly One, unfolds in a time and place that vacillates among revolutionary narratives of the past, the fragile and ever-changing political situation of the present, and attempts to piece together the memories of those that live, or once lived, in the city. Conceived as a sequel to his documentary The Anabasis of May and Fusako Shigenobu, Masao Adachi and 27 Years Without Images (2011), Baudelaire builds the structure of the film around a story told by Japanese New Wave film director Adachi, who also narrates the film. The plot line pivots around two lovers and former resistance fighters, Michel (played by Lebanese artist and actor Rabih Mroué) and Lili (Juliette Navis); their narratives fragment and reconfigure around the screenplay, which itself intertwines with Adachi’s own history, the act of making the film, and the self-conscious and sometimes improvisatory process of writing the script.","Currently based in Paris, Franco-American artist Eric Baudelaire has developed an oeuvre primarily composed of film, but which also includes photography, silkscreen prints, performance, publications and installations. In his research-based practice, the artist examines the relationship between images, past events and their documentation. Interested in the role of the cinematographic image as an index marker, Baudelaire creates narratives in which recorded facts serve as a starting point for an exploration of the unknown. In examining the changes in human behavior though interrogating the great political structures that govern the global, national and micro-communities, Baudelaire’s practice could be read through a bio-political perspective. Navigating the experience of urban living, the global, technical and economic dependencies of war, movement and the contemporary paradigm of geographical proximity and distance, Baudelaire’s practice evokes a hauntingly provocative perspective on the current political climate.",The Ugly One,Europe,"['movie.n.01', 'narrative.n.01', 'wave.n.01', 'fragment.n.01', 'actor.n.01', 'documentary.a.01', 'japanese.a.01', 'resistance.n.01', 'situation.n.01', 'attempt.n.01', 'structure.n.01', 'memory.n.01', 'city.n.01', 'procedure.n.01', 'political.a.01', 'history.n.01', 'time.n.01', 'image.n.01']","['lebanon.n.01', 'war-torn.s.01', 'lover.n.01', 'combatant.n.01', 'avant-garde.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/TheUglyOne_low.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/TheUglyOne_low-212x300.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/the-ugly-one/,"['Material_Physical/4.219883040935672', 'Society/0.7777777777777778']","['Material_Physical', 'Society']",4.99766081871345,"['Land/2.6198830409356724', 'Environmental/1.6', 'Urbanization/0.7777777777777778']","['Land', 'Environmental', 'Urbanization']",4.99766081871345,"['Cultural/40.731740481740495', 'Society/22.67004955828486', 'Individual_Personal/20.624542124542128']","['Cultural', 'Society', 'Individual_Personal']",84.02633216456748,"['Arts/10.743223443223444', 'Media/10.026678876678876', 'Time/8.361838161838161']","['Arts', 'Media', 'Time']",29.131740481740483,0.4,0.0
Maayan Amir & Ruti Sela,"In Beyond Guilt the two artists create a portrait of our generation in three parts. In Tel Aviv, in confined spaces such as toilets or bar of hotel rooms, they create situations in which participants answer questions and describe themselves. Camera in hand, there is little editing in their works, leaving a rather crude result. The camera becomes the witness of exchange between the participants and the artists in a relationship of power and seduction. These people could easily have counterparts in Western societies. Yet, what is ultimately disturbing is the contradiction between a very light form of life turned to pleasure, sex, or transgression and violence. One in which we perceive the trauma of a permanent war, a conflict sometimes assumed and claimed.","Maayan Amir and Ruti Sela, two young Israeli women artists work collaboratively or individually by project. Shot in Tel Aviv, their short videos report contradictions of a society defined by power relations, commonly featuring subjects like artists and models, men and women, and the private and public domain. Their films offer a fresh examination of the influence of occupation, terror, and the army in Israeli identity. Even in the most private moments, sexual identity and political identity are inextricably linked in their works. For their latest project “Exterritory,” the two artists left their cameras in distinct locations to collectively investigate space beyond borders in different neighboring countries at war. This utopian project exists only in a temporary situation, a place located in transit across the maritime horizons. There, Maayan Amir and Ruti Sela, other artists and curators, met to develop a film program centering on the concept of extraterritoriality. The first program “Exterritory” was held June 17 to 21, 2010, (coincidentally a few days after the Israeli attack of the fleet on its way to Gaza) on a ship that traveled from Israel to Cyprus.

Saâdane Afif,,"Saâdane Afif practices the quote: “I belong to a generation of artists who {…} discuss art as a form of language, with which you play upon, you deform, you transform, without focusing on the object as it was before.” Such strategies of re-appropriation insert themselves inside a context of idea circulation, as a form of remixing and remaking. In the work “Pirates Who’s Who,” tactics of assemblage are recognizable on all levels. The artist makes use of an eccentric shelf by designer Ron Arad, displaying dripping paint on the wall while the shelf itself holds a collection of books on piracy, compiled together by the owner of the work. “Power chords” (2005), perhaps the most ambitious project by the artist to date, is both a work for publication and several exhibitions. The installation depicts automatic electric guitars, playing scores orchestrated by a computer program. The chords are defined by color sequences derived from André Cadere’s wooden segments. Yet with Afif’s displacement, the artist hints to the color and rhythmic sound dimensions vis-à-vis Cadere, inside a genre of synesthesia. In an age of numerical technology, Cadere’s rhythmic system echoes in a particular manner together with the processes of digitization. Afif suggests a principle of encoding the world underlying the real, or rhythmic language before the Tower of Babel. Saâdane Afif was born in 1970 in Vendome, France.

Raphaël Zarka,"Raphaël Zarka discovered the scientific manuscripts of Abraham Sharp while in Oxford. Sharp was an English 18th century astronomer whose treatise Geometry Improved became the subject of a new body of photographs and sculptures. In this document, Sharp draws infinite possible combinations that enable the making of a polyhedron from a wooden cube – the most complex figure allows a perfect form with 120 facets. Sharp’s studies found their outlet in this manuscript, but had no particular function as such. In the same way as an artist obsessed with pure form, Sharp creates aesthetic objects, geometric sculptures.  By reproducing Sharp’s drawing through an operation of pyrography onto oak beams, Raphaël Zarka seems to want to verify the scientist’s theories. But the artist stops half-way since he only applies the tracing on the raw wooden form; it is up to the spectator to go a step further to obtain a perfect polyhedron. Over to imagination or perhaps to time which might end up following the tracings and felling the wood. As opposed to other works by Zarka, this is not a replica or a reproduction but rather an application, a manifestation, which, although incomplete, seems to have allowed something to emerge. Simultaneously enigmatic and discrete despite its imposing size, the two photographs of the Geometry Improved treatise can complement the group of work.","Raphaël Zarka presents himself as a sculptor and artist-collector. He scrutinises the contemporary world to draw up a genealogy of geometric forms. He is constantly noticing Plato’s polyhedrons (speculative geometric forms) materialized in concrete breakwaters (Les formes du repos series/The Forms of Rest). His work highlights the fact that the ‘survival of forms’ (Aby Warburg) takes place in today’s world in functional and concrete environments. The artist acts with the curiosity of the Renaissance humanists in their studio (Studiolo, 2008), but he has adopted a thinking structure where dichotomies and the methodological boundaries of Art History are banned. With his typical transversal approach, the artist has started theoretical research into the urban practice that is skateboard by publishing essays and realizing artistic projects. In Riding modern art  (Lyon Biennale, 2007), he confronts photographs of the skaters performing on public sculptures with a sculpture by Katarzyna Kobro. The confrontation underlines that the movement is either of aesthetic potential for modern sculpture or a mechanical realization for skating. “It’s almost an insult to the mysteries of the world to think that we could invent anything or that we needed to invent anything”; this quote by Borgès has become the artist’s motto.Raphaël Zarka was born in 1957 in Montpellier, France.

Jonas Staal,"Jonas Staal’s installation is based on the thesis written by Fleur Agema and titled “Closed Architecture”. The paper, written by the second most important person of Geert Wilderds’ Freedom Party, concerns an ambitious model for a new prison that focuses on the reconditioning of prisoners by means of four phases. Staal’s work is developed through a book, a plan and a 3d virtual tour in the social imagery of a current minister of the State of the Netherlands. Through this meticulous work by the artist the perspectives on political and architectural planning of a new right wing populist class of politicians is revealed and exposed through an analytic display.  As Jonas Staal points out: “This change in society requires more prisons since the entire society has become a model of detention: everyone is trapped in their own social conditions, whether poor or rich. Within the the debate on the representation of society and the society of control the work of Agema should be considered as a case study compared to the possibility of an open and democratic society, in which the interest common and political emancipation take center stage.”  For Staal, this model can be considered an ideological model in relation to how the Dutch society is now developing, with poor suburbs and gated communities under surveillance.","Jonas Staal ‘s work includes interventions in public spaces, exhibitions, lectures and publications.

"Frédéric Moser, Philippe Schwinger","In 1978, Jean-Luc Godard and Anne-Marie Miéville made the TV series: “France / tour / detour / two / children”, in which they aimed to identify the lifestyle of French people in 12 episodes of 26 minutes each. On each episode a little boy and girl are firstly asked about their daily lives. By broadening the scope of the interview, the questions of Godard and Mieville gradually bring the protagonists to think of themselves as subjects in the history of the world, to “live and see themselves on television” with a critical point of view. Thirty years after Godard and Mieville’s series, the two artists initiate a project, entitled France, detours, divided into four episodes, by which  they are invited to “interrogate the French” in order to reflect on the question of “living together”. The first episode was made in 2009 at Mirail Housing State, a great set designed by architect Candilis in the 1960s on the outskirts of Toulouse. The second episode (co-produced by Kadist Art Foundation and the production company of L’âge d’or) is held in the Paris suburbs, in Pierrefitte, with dropouts and college officials AFPAD (Association for education, prevention and access to rights). In this episode they present youths  with different social backgrounds who do not quite confirm the stereotypes that the media and politicians are trying to create. For this work, Moser and Schwinger followied Jacques Rancière’s hypothesis that “the real must be fictionalized to be thought.”",Born in Switzerland      Born in Switzerland,"France, détours, episode 2: this line is your path",Europe,"['episode.n.01', 'french.a.01', 'question.n.01', 'male_child.n.01', 'interview.n.01', 'plan.v.03', 'keep.v.01', 'television.n.01', 'company.n.01', 'life.n.02', 'critical.a.01', 'supporter.n.01', 'association.n.01', 'paris.n.01', 'daily.s.01', 'production.n.01', 'set.n.01', 'background.n.01', 'child.n.01', 'series.n.01', 'real.a.01', 'artist.n.01', 'position.n.03', 'medium.n.01', 'undertaking.n.01']","['identity.n.01', 'young_person.n.01', 'society.n.01', 'history.n.01', 'french.a.01', 'everyday.s.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/FD2_videostill.01_site.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/FD2_videostill.01_site-300x169.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/france-detours-episode-2-this-line-is-your-path/,"['Individual_Personal/4.797979797979798', 'Material_Physical/2.709090909090909', 'Society/2.0']","['Individual_Personal', 'Material_Physical', 'Society']",9.507070707070707,"['Identity/4.797979797979798', 'Time/2.709090909090909', 'Community/1.0']","['Identity', 'Time', 'Community']",8.507070707070707,"['Cultural/28.12276987718165', 'Society/15.344108669108673', 'Politics/14.927228327228333']","['Cultural', 'Society', 'Politics']",58.39410687351866,"['Media/11.054638009049773', 'Politics/7.885470085470085', 'Spirituality/5.591208791208791']","['Media', 'Politics', 'Spirituality']",24.53131688572865,0.3333333333333333,0.0
Goldin+Senneby,"In Fiction on Auction, the site of the auction is used to stage a fiction where the right to appear as character in Looking for Headless is offered to the highest bidder: the name of the successful biddder as registered for the auction will form the name or identity of the character appearing in the novel.  Looking for Headless is written by the fictitious author K.D and tells the story of two artists Simon Goldin and Jakob Senneby who collaborate with an author, John Barlow. Goldin and Senneby investigate an offshore company on the Bahamas called Headless Ltd whilst Barlow writes a docu-fictional murder-mystery, also called Headless, based on these investigations. The three protagonists become increasingly entangled in the world of offshore business, while speculating about the possible connections between Headless Ltd and the secret society known as Acéphale ( from the Greek term, acephalus, meaning headless) founded by George Bataille and his circle of friends connected to the College de Sociologie in Paris in the late 1930s.  Goldin and Senneby have created a series of exhibition projects in parallel with Looking for Headless which examine elements of the novel, including the identity of Headless Ltd, and explore the juridical construction of off-shore financial centres as strategies of withdrawal from public visibility.

Goldin+Senneby,"In this installation, you are standing at the heart of a bicephalous space reflecting Goldin+Senneby’s main research led during their residency in Paris. Here, two historical events from the late 1930’s and early 50’s are confronted.  In one of these spaces, you find yourself reading a map of the Marly forest where Georges Bataille’s secret society, « Acéphale », was meeting around 1937 and notably celebrating Louis XVI’s regicide.  A few years later, Georges Bataille wrote La Part maudite (1949). In this essay on economy, he describes a society of abundance and eternal excess where in return potlatch techniques and sacrifice were necessary forms of luxurious consumption.  Nearly at the same time, in the early 1950’s at the very beginning of the Cold War, you are witnessing the emergence of Eurodollar, when Soviet and Chinese banks deposited dollars in Europe, in Paris at the BCEN (EUROBANK), known today as VTB Bank. Thus, the Dollar escaped the US financial, territorial jurisdiction and the very nature of money changed from a symbolic value to  a virtual one. Money entered a new space of exteriority, beyond the control of the sovereign state.  Money was decapitated.  These are facts. Facts that are deeply entangled in a fictional narrative entitled Looking for Headless,  commissioned by artist duo Goldin+Senneby since 2007. In this detective story, involving a murder (by decapitation again), the narrator travels to the Bahamas looking for the offshore company called ‘Headless Ltd’. Looking for Headless is published as a ghost written serial novel based on raw material sent by the artists correspondences, dossiers, tapes – and by the different artistic presentations of the project since 2007 in the form of conferences, lectures, videos or exhibitions.  At the Kadist Art Foundation, Goldin+Senneby underline a tenuous but precise speculation: Is the emergence of the Eurodollar and the later offshore finance the exact void where money disappeared, performing a contemporary radical consumption announced by Bataille in La Part maudite?  And if so, can ‘Headless Ltd’ be a contemporary incarnation of Bataille’s secret society of the same  name, « Acéphale »? Are they just mere coincidences?  The artistic project Headless is an omnivorous structure, a multi-headed project in which artists Goldin+Senneby outsource its development to different characters in the novel and independent practitioners in reality: a ghostwriter, an economic geographer, a set designer, and even art institutions.",G+S (since 2004) is a framework for collaboration set up by Swedish artists Simon Goldin and Jakob Senneby.

Amie Siegel,"Berlin Remake (2005) combines extracts of East German films with images filmed by the artist in Berlin. While staying in Berlin, the artist found the locations where the official films were made and she juxtaposes the two in a synchronised double projection. Therefore on one screen there is Berlin between 1945 and 1989 and on the other Berlin in 2004. The contrast between the two is troubling, strange and uncanny (Freud would say unheimlich). History in both continuous and ruptured. It is as if the artist was remaking these films but without the actors, or the plot; in a way it is a meditation on absence as well as a demonstration of the changes in Berlin. She also uses an extract of the last film to be shot under the Communist regime. The scene occurs in a place that has been entirely reconstructed since. At the beginning, the film itself looks like a remake of an old East German film but during the projection it transpires more like a comparison rather than a reconstruction. The film is simultaneously a search for lost time and for recaptured time.","Amie Siegel works with the cinematic image—the precise production of filmic and still images—to produce artworks that address deeper social issues. She fakes and remakes, to purposefully tell lies as a vehicle to a greater truth. Through researching and implicitly critiquing the history of film, Seigel makes use of genre tropes, such as those found in science fiction, noir and the western. She also has a keen interest in politics, critical theory and a marked distrust of  capitalism.",Berlin Remake,Americas,"['movie.n.01', 'projection.n.01', 'film.v.01', 'shoot.v.01', 'strange.a.01', 'lose.v.01', 'actor.n.01', 'time.n.01', 'location.n.01', 'contrast.n.01', 'screen.n.01', 'government.n.01', 'scene.n.01', 'history.n.01', 'image.n.01']","['transformation.n.05', 'reshoot.v.01', 'east_germany.n.01', 'perturb.v.01', 'comparison.n.02', 'communism.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/img-777.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/img-777-300x225.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/berlin-remake/,"['Material_Physical/3.4948830409356724', 'Politics/3.317460317460317', 'Society/2.496732026143791']","['Material_Physical', 'Politics', 'Society']",9.309075384539781,"['Land/2.6198830409356724', 'Politics/1.7619047619047619', 'Economy/1.7189542483660132']","['Land', 'Politics', 'Economy']",6.100742051206447,"['Material_Physical/16.618004218004224', 'Cultural/11.584920634920636', 'Society/5.795604395604396']","['Material_Physical', 'Cultural', 'Society']",33.99852924852925,"['Land/5.507692307692308', 'Media/4.250854700854701', 'Space/3.434920634920635']","['Land', 'Media', 'Space']",13.193467643467644,0.6666666666666666,0.3333333333333333
Christoph Keller,"Message to the Extraterrestrials consists of a slide projector beaming images into the side of the telescope. These are then reflected down to a mirror at the bottom of the telescope and from there to a mirror on the ceiling. From the ceiling the images bounce down to a mirror at floor level which projects the images through an open window to the world outside. The function of the telescope has been inverted and transformed from a receiver to a broadcaster of light. The images it projects are selected from the ‘Golden Record’ produced for the Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 missions. These were intended to inform any extraterrestrials of life and culture on earth. Described by Ann Druyan, author and science media producer, as ‘a classic message in a bottle’ there was never any knowing whether, if viewed by an extraterrestrial, they would be able to decode the visual signals or not. The projection of these images by the Voyager spacecraft was at once an informative and a futile gesture. Ed Stone, Voyager’s project scientist, stated that “In a sense it is a unifying message. It’s a message from Earth. It contains greetings in many languages, music from many cultures and images that portray our home planet.”","Christoph Keller’s works function between science and art and have a practical as well as an aesthetic application. They are interventions into reality as well as inventions. Keller is fascinated by previous scientific undertakings such as Wilhelm Reich’s Cloudbuster project that Keller re-enacted from the roof of PS1 in an attempt to make rain over New York in the Spring and Summer of 2003 using orgone and nuclear energy. Keller’s stance is at once social political and artistic. He is engaged in debates around existence and the human condition. His project Helioflex is an attempt, using mirrors, to ‘bypass the social gradient of access to sunlight in urban habitations’, in other words to bring sunlight to areas normally in shadow at an affordable price. According to Keller the density of building generates a social gradient of sunlight in urban areas. The top floors bathe in light that is missing in the bottom floors. The device bypasses this gradient and creates a connection to the outside world by reflecting natural light to spaces that have never seen the sun before.’ Keller’s political engagement is in the tradition of Josef Beuys, who taught at the Free University in Berlin where Keller began to study physics in 1988. Christoph Keller is a German artist who studied math, physics and hydrology before studying liberal arts in Berlin. Christoph Keller was born in  Fribourg, Germany, in 1967.

Takeshi Murata,"Takeshi Murata developed an interest in space inspired by his architect parents. OM Rider features the artist’s characteristic absurdist humor and aesthetics–a mélange of highly attuned lighting and composition (in homage to Ken Price), with retro modeling and minimalist, almost antiseptic spaces.","Takeshi Murata writes about his use of media: “Illusion is one aspect that is important. Other mediums can be used in a similar illusionistic manner, but there is usually an object grounding it in reality.

Truong Cong Tung,"Truong Cong Tung’s Journey of a Piece of Soil (2013) and its accompanying object-based installation of the same name (2014) consider the function of ritual in larger modes of collective engagement and cultural production. In examining how spirituality inflects social engagement, Truong’s contemplates the juncture at which the rational beings encounter the unexplained while also suggesting how embodied practices offer vital conduits for experiencing new modes of consciousness. The video features a man dressed in camouflage fatigues with a blue cap tilling a patch of red-clay soil amidst a green-stalk covered patch of land. Throughout, he carries a strange object on his shoulder and what from a distance appears to be an amorphous rock riddled with holes. As the camera zooms in, however, the holes are covered with countless small and scurrying insects: termites crawling across a nest. The man, though, continues to carry the nest as if it were a precious object, digging holes to protect it from the elements, kneeling before it like a devotional relic, sleeping and rocking with it as if it were a loved one. The rural shamanism of the work might be located in spiritual practices such as those of the Apichatpong in Thailand, and there is an aspect of the unknowable to Truong’s depiction of almost intensely private and unspoken ritual. There’s no clear indication why Truong or the man in the video (who may or may not be the artist) are drawn to the termite’s nest, and yet that arguably is what makes Journey of a Piece of Soil so fascinating as a work about devotion: it powerfully depicts the steady and uncompromised determination our various faiths require of us and the ways in which that unwavering exactitude affects our embodied sense of being.","Truong Cong Tung produces work that can be located amongst an aesthetic realm outside of reason or sense. Deliberately more intuitive, his video and installation based practice eschews obvious “subjects” and is more readily about the universe of spirituality, shamanism, and ghosts. His installations could be seen as mediums to approach these fields in our contemporary moment, and much of his work examines how faith and belief are posited in diametric opposition to more secular urbanism. At the same time, his practice is inherently performative, and in foregrounding embodied movement through his video and accompanying object-based works, Truong also considers how our bodies act as sites through which the rational and sensate, as well as the intellectual and spiritual, come into communion with one another.",Journey of a Piece of Soil,Asia,"['hole.n.01', 'journey.n.01', 'manner.n.01', 'practice.n.01', 'piece.n.01', 'object.n.01', 'pull.v.01', 'consciousness.n.01', 'strange.a.01', 'private.a.01', 'religious.s.01', 'locate.v.01', 'distance.n.01', 'rock.n.01', 'land.n.01', 'function.n.01', 'aspect.n.01', 'video.n.01', 'production.n.01', 'corporate.s.03', 'elements.n.01', 'sense.n.01', 'camera.n.01', 'cultural.a.01', 'social.a.01']","['ritual.n.01', 'spiritualty.n.01', 'consciousness.n.01', 'devotion.n.01', 'religion.n.01', 'communion.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/tung_soil_1_web.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/tung_soil_1_web-200x300.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/journey-piece-soil/,"['Individual_Personal/17.52267830209007', 'Society/9.145098039215686', 'Cultural/7.419406737053795']","['Individual_Personal', 'Society', 'Cultural']",34.08718307835955,"['Culture/5.850175967823026', 'Emotion/5.759706959706959', 'Spirituality/4.3500000000000005']","['Culture', 'Emotion', 'Spirituality']",15.959882927529986,"['Society/17.54931124946605', 'Material_Physical/17.241564318034914', 'Politics/15.95129329734593']","['Society', 'Material_Physical', 'Politics']",50.74216886484689,"['Space/8.026826115061409', 'Culture/5.2039377289377295', 'Spirituality/4.026373626373626']","['Space', 'Culture', 'Spirituality']",17.257137470372765,0.3333333333333333,0.6666666666666666

Will Rogan,"Will Rogan’s video Eraser (2014) shows a hearse parked in a clearing amidst leaf barren trees. The steely grey sky stands in stark contrast to the vehicle’s luminously pristine white finish and makes this already deathly object seem even more ghostly. The grass underneath is half-turned brown and further marks this as a lifeless landscape. Suddenly, however, a flash begins to emerge from the front tire, illuminating the ground with a fiery glow. As it begins to radiate, the flash slowly spreads across the hood and the windows until the car begins to buckle, smoke creeping up in columns across the sky. As the door juts off the body, we begin to realize that we’re witnessing an explosion in slow motion, total destruction rendered almost balletic through a poetic stretching of time. Shot with a technically advanced camera that shoots 6,900 frames per second, Eraser expands four seconds of “real” time into a nearly six minute duration in which we witness a slow but absolute annihilation. By slowing down the video’s pace to a near crawl, Rogan’s work could be seen as a deliberate resistance to mortality, as if he could actually forestall or delay death in defying the rules of time. At the same time, he employs a wry visual humor that relishes in absurdity in which the exploding hearse becomes an over-the-top funeral pyre and a clear example of “overkill.” In gesturing towards a darkly comic ars moriendi, Eraser fits alongside other humorous narratives about death such as the 1971 Hal Ashby film Harold and Maude, which also ends with a scene of a similarly demolished hearse. But just as that film ends with the promise of hopeful next chapters, Rogan’s video also offers the strange but meditative possibility of regenerative beginnings. Screened on a continuous loop, Rogan signals that it is impossible to escape reminders of our mortality, and just as the explosion finishes, the hearse appears again, seemingly untouched. But if death is ultimately inescapable, Rogan also reveals the beauty in clearing away its reminders and beginning again out of fire and smoke.","Based in the San Francisco Bay Area, Will Rogan’s practice reflects the poignant, the ironic, the disastrous, and the beautiful in his surrounding urban and domestic landscapes. In the form of photography, video, and sculpture, his interventions often highlight the profound and analytical in everyday life. Taking a playful stance on mundane situations and structures, Rogan’s work merges the critical with the poetic.

Xiaoyun Chen,"The central point of Vanishing Point is the most direct physiological reaction of the body to the environment. Chen Xiaoyun has added a written narrative and a poetic quality to his works. Image fragments containing different pieces of information are linked together by the text, their interplay producing a synesthesia effect. The abstract quality of the expressive fragmented pictures and narrative text provide the viewer with an imaginative space that is broader than the one they would experience in a traditional linear narrative. The problem of reality becomes abstract, arousing reflection in the mind and heart. The video’s literary style gives the viewer a sense of reading. Although the questions are silent, the text increases the impact on the mind. By probing reality with poetic metaphor, Chen Xiaoyun’s works present a fragmented landscape that is produced through resistance against the systems of reality.","Chen Xiaoyun studied ink painting at the Chinese Academy of Arts and lived as a writer in Suzhou before becoming part of the Hangzhou video art community. Chen’s works stages scenes of everyday life with elements of the strange and the absurd in order to explore existentialist themes through narratives of visual linearity.

Ximena Garrido Lecca,"Destilaciones (Distillations, 2014) is an installation composed of a group of ceramic pots, presented on the floor and within a steel structure. Copper pipes run through the perforated ceramics, evoking the design of an oil purifier. The work is a direct reference to the history of the Peruvian coastal town of Lobitos. The extraction of oil began in Lobitos at the start of the twentieth century, with the arrival of the British oil company Lobitos Oilfields Limited. The infrastructure built alongside the plant included a desalination plant (now defunct), a church, a casino, and a cinema (one of the first in Latin America), all now in ruins. Following a 1968 military coup, the Peruvian government initiated a program of nationalization and the oil fields fell under the control of the state. The Ministry of Defence built a military base on the adjacent land. Soon, a slow decline due to mismanagement sent the town into economic collapse, mirroring the economy nationally. Today one encounters the ruins of buildings left by the British oil company; the debris of what used to be the old military base; and the traffic of surfers that come every year in search of waves. Currently, the oil extraction is concessioned to South American Petroleum Exploration Tech (Sapet), a transnational company funded mainly with Chinese capital. There is also a major investment plan to privatize the town, proposing a transformation of Lobitos into a tourist resort. Destilaciones portrays these different waves of colonialism and the exercise of authoritarian power within the context of a developing country. By tracing economic and political cycles, the artist intends to register the residue of human activity within the landscape. Environmental and social issues are presented in relation to the modern exploitation of resources and localized ancient practices such as fishing and pottery. The three epochs of political domination that have left their mark on Lobitos—European colonialism, the nation-state autonomy, and neoliberal globalization—have all left behind remnants of their failure.","Ximena Garrido-Lecca examines the turbulent history of Peru, and specifically how neocolonial standards are transmitted through the processes of globalization. The artist approaches her works by scrutinizing urban, rural, and vernacular architecture, concentrating on spaces where a mediatory materiality is visible between the specific and the universal. Equally important is the memory of artisanal tradition and the abandonment of rural spaces as an aftereffect of the processes of modernization. Her work insinuates a permanent tension between the inheritance of vernacular culture and the new demands of industrialization, signaling the violence contained in an accelerated transnational economic model in increasingly open confrontation with the protection of the environment, sovereignty, and respect for different community lifestyles.",Destilaciones,Americas,"['oil.n.01', 'company.n.01', 'town.n.01', 'military.a.01', 'wave.n.01', 'british.a.01', 'plan.n.01', 'plant.n.01', 'leave.v.01', 'economic.a.01', 'political.a.01', 'film.n.02', 'exploration.n.01', 'mark.n.01', 'american.n.01', 'control.n.01', 'chinese.a.01', 'transformation.n.01', 'direct.a.01', 'activity.n.01', 'economy.n.01', 'era.n.01', 'united_states.n.01', 'land.n.01', 'design.n.01']","['ceramics.n.01', 'industry.n.01', 'military.n.01', 'economy.n.01', 'colonialism.n.01', 'environment.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/ximena_garrido_lecca_destilaciones1.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/ximena_garrido_lecca_destilaciones1-300x218.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/destilaciones-distillations/,"['Society/9.562129683182313', 'Cultural/7.052287581699346', 'Material_Physical/2.58021978021978']","['Society', 'Cultural', 'Material_Physical']",19.194637045101437,"['Arts/4.607843137254902', 'Economy/3.6025641025641026', 'Colonization/1.7777777777777777']","['Arts', 'Economy', 'Colonization']",9.98818501759678,"['Cultural/35.34550204697264', 'Society/25.052345040580345', 'Individual_Personal/17.628937728937736']","['Cultural', 'Society', 'Individual_Personal']",78.02678481649073,"['Arts/13.0181570063923', 'Land/9.328236125759345', 'Media/8.995202183437478']","['Arts', 'Land', 'Media']",31.341595315589124,0.6666666666666666,0.3333333333333333
Yangjiang Group,"One Day in the Mountain is a bilingual calligraphic performance piece written in ink superimposed with food leftover from a meal. The eponymous text: “One day in mountain is worth two thousands years in the world.” is written horizontally from left to right in both English and Chinese, following the writing order of modern Chinese instead of the traditional vertical right to left. With the  word “is” migrating from the middle of the English phrase to be surrounded by Chinese characters, the resultant text appears to be spatially illustrating the meaning of being isolated in the mountain. The ink formed from the intermingling of food juices generates an energy circuit of inner cultivation through calligraphy writing with that the outer alchemy of cooking food. Furthermore, equating one day in the mountain with two thousand years also suggests that such transference of energy between insularity and worldliness can alter one’s experience and value of time.","Zheng Guogu founded the artistic group Yangjiang Group in 2002 with Chen Zaiyan (b. 1971, Yangchun, China) and Sun Qinglin (b. 1974, Yangjiang, China). For the Yangjiang Group, calligraphy functions as a metaphor for unpredictable, mysterious encounters hidden under the surface of a materialistic, confusing world. Their works focus on mundane daily actions and processes through the construction of large-scale, non-traditional architectural structures in Yangjiang as well as performances and site specific exhibitions at galleries, museums and art fairs around the world.  They primarily work in calligraphy in conjunction with daily activities such as meeting, eating, drinking, bartering, gaming, and gambling. Seeing Yangjiang as a place on the periphery of political influence from Beijing, their aim is to transgress any rules or controlled conditions for calligraphy writing. The intermixing of imbibing and writing also ensures a material circulation of inner being and outward energy that dissipates the boundaries between art and lived experience.",One day in mountain is worth two thousands years in the world,Asia,"['mountain.n.01', 'food.n.01', 'day.n.01', 'leave.v.01', 'write.v.01', 'phrase.n.01', 'chinese.a.01', 'form.v.01', 'change.v.01', 'modern.a.01', 'traditional.a.01', 'center.n.01', 'meaning.n.01', 'fictional_character.n.01', 'performance.n.01', 'experience.n.01', 'piece.n.01', 'time.n.01']","['calligraphy.n.01', 'language.n.01', 'text.n.01', 'isolation.n.03', 'food.n.01', 'time.n.05']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/yangjiang_group_one_day_in_the_mountain_is_worth_two_thousand_years_in_the_world.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/yangjiang_group_one_day_in_the_mountain_is_worth_two_thousand_years_in_the_world-300x300.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/one-day-mountain/,"['Cultural/9.053724053724054', 'Material_Physical/4.555555555555555', 'Society/1.6']","['Cultural', 'Material_Physical', 'Society']",15.209279609279609,"['Language/4.746031746031746', 'Time/3.6666666666666665', 'Culture/1.7692307692307692']","['Language', 'Time', 'Culture']",10.181929181929181,"['Cultural/9.364219277454572', 'Material_Physical/7.254492875545507', 'Individual_Personal/5.541075917546506']","['Cultural', 'Material_Physical', 'Individual_Personal']",22.159788070546583,"['Culture/3.4615384615384617', 'Fantasy/3.276307189542484', 'Mind/3.1855203619909505']","['Culture', 'Fantasy', 'Mind']",9.923366013071895,0.6666666666666666,0.3333333333333333
Yao Jui-Chung,"Long Long Live (2013) takes the viewer to the setting of the Oasis Villa on Green Island, once a reform and re-education prison to house political prisoners during Taiwan’s martial law period. In black and white, Yao depicts the historical site as an eerie abandoned compound. Reflecting on the centenary of the HsinHai Revolution and the end of the Cold War, Yao questions the existence of an ever lasting dynasty or “transcendental Rules of History.” The soundtrack features a sole voice reverberating through loud speakers. Someone is repeatedly shouting long live from the Hall of the Eternally Living Chiang Kai-shek, a building in Chiang Kai-shek’s former residence in Yang Mingshan. As the camera pans out, the scene is revealed to be from a broadcast on an old television set in an empty cafeteria, where bowls and plates are set perfectly on tables. The multiple layers of embedded media structures examine the legacy of propaganda machines of yesteryear and their echoes in contemporary culture.","Born in 1969, Yao Jui-Chung specializes in photography, installation art, and art theory. His works examine the absurdity of the human condition through the creation of beautiful yet intellectually provocative visual experiences. Also a curator, art critic, and art historian who lived through Taiwan’s turbulent socio-political changes, Yao often explores issues of history and society, especially those surrounding the political status of Taiwan and an ambiguous collective consciousness. Yao graduated from the Taipei National University of the Arts, where he also teaches with dedication to evaluate and promote Taiwanese contemporary art.",Long Long Live,Asia,"['prison.n.01', 'rule.n.01', 'television.n.01', 'being.n.01', 'life.n.02', 'setting.n.01', 'black.a.01 white.a.01', 'island.n.01', 'uncover.v.01', 'machine.n.01', 'multiple.a.01', 'put.v.01', 'voice.n.01', 'layer.n.01', 'house.n.01', 'time_period.n.01', 'set.n.01', 'structure.n.01', 'building.n.01', 'war.n.01', 'historical.a.01', 'contemporary.s.01', 'black.a.01', 'white.a.01', 'medium.n.01']","['captivity.n.01', 'revolution.n.02', 'war.n.01', 'history.n.02', 'propaganda.n.01', 'culture.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/long_long_live_01.png,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/long_long_live_01-300x169.png,https://kadist.org/work/long-long-live/,"['Society/7.126851090086384', 'Politics/2.857142857142857', 'Cultural/2.3384615384615386']","['Society', 'Politics', 'Cultural']",12.32245548569078,"['War/3.75', 'Activism/2.0', 'Violence/1.6985294117647058']","['War', 'Activism', 'Violence']",7.448529411764706,"['Cultural/49.7460766357825', 'Society/22.44223031870091', 'Individual_Personal/17.786672641084408']","['Cultural', 'Society', 'Individual_Personal']",89.97497959556782,"['Arts/17.479787043022338', 'Media/13.362330316742081', 'Technology/8.803104575163399']","['Arts', 'Media', 'Technology']",39.64522193492782,0.6666666666666666,0.0
Cao Fei,"Diversionist is part of the Cosplayers Series from 2004. In Cosplayers Cao Fei depicts the popularity among Asian youths of “cosplay” in which daily life is merged with images of video games and popular films. For many, this virtual reality is an outlet to “transcend” the paradox of a developing society in which the pleasures of consumption and depression of alienation go hand-in-hand. Cao Fei sensitively captures the new social consciousness and activism, beautifully translating them into photographic and video works.","Cao Fei is a celebrated multimedia artist known for works that focus on the interplay between real and fictional worlds. Working across photography, performance, video, and digital media, her practice vividly reflects the zeitgeist of the late twentieth century and the role that image production has played in shaping youth culture in a digital era. Influenced by an array of forms of global pop culture—from Cantonese Pop and Japanese anime to American hip-hop—a common thread in her practice is the merging of everyday life with new forms of technology as a means to unveil society’s unfulfilled desires.  Her pivotal film Whose Utopia, for example, showcases assembly line workers in a factory in China as they act out their aspirations in a backdrop of industrial machinery. In another key body of work, RMB City, Fei created a virtual city through the platform Second Life—an online space that mimics ‘the real world’—as a vehicle to express ideas that relate to modernization, capitalism, and consumer culture. Through these constructed worlds, Fei presents a profound meditation on the boundaries between the real and the fantastic and the sense of alienation that drives new generations to increasingly experience the world behind the veneer of their Avatars.

Lu Chunsheng,"A mesmerizing experience of a vaguely familiar yet remote world, History of Chemistry I follows a group of men as they wander from somewhere beyond the edge of the sea through a vast landscape to an abandoned steel factory. Using long shots and atypical settings, Lu Chunsheng enigmatically refers to a distant history while conveying the sense of dislocation wrought by successive stages of modernization. The combination of elaborate landscape shots from the suburbs of Shanghai and Lu’s signature style of spare and minimally crafted acting offers a surreal view of human behavior in spaces marked by the hulking remnants of China’s extraordinary development.","A particularly generative aspect of Lu Chunsheng’s work is the way it breaches the boundary between documentary and fiction. Rather than merely illustrate it, his conceptual and methodological coherence broadens and extends his inquiry into everyday life.

Bani Abidi,"The threshold in contemporary Pakistan between the security of private life and the increasingly violent and unpredictable public sphere is represented in Abidi’s 2009 series Karachi. These staged photographs were shot against the backdrop of the city’s empty streets at sundown during the holy month of Ramadan. During this time, Muslims fast and retreat indoors, leaving the city eerily empty. By portraying ordinary citizens from religious minorities, the photographs reclaim the occupation of public space. Domestic gestures are brought forward and presented in the streets. By being so specific about the times and locations where they were shot, Abidi tests the political potentials of these everyday gestures.  In Karachi Series I (Ken DeSouza, 7:42pm, 25th August 2008, Ramadan, Karachi) (2009), a man in a white shirt polishes his shoes without further revealing anything else about his identity. Presented in lightboxes, the pictures’ backlit luminosity exaggerates their absurdity and strangeness.","Bani Abidi’s practice deals heavily with political and cultural relations between India and Pakistan; she has a personal interest in this, as she lives and works in both New Delhi and Karachi. The artist’s subject matter ranges from border tensions to immigration conflicts, cultural diversity, and the relationship between private and public space.

Hamra Abbas,"At first glance, Cityscapes (2010) seems to be a collection of panoramic photographs of the city of Istanbul—the kind that are found on postcards in souvenir shops. A closer examination, however, reveals that a key element—the minaret—has been systematically removed, thereby changing profoundly the history and religious character of the city. The work is a response to a November 2009 referendum in Switzerland that approved a ban on the construction of new minarets in that country. It was also a crucial time in Turkey’s negotiation for entrance into the European Union. Instead of making a direct, didactic comment on the controversy, however, Abbas offers up a clever question regarding how landmarks are interpreted in vastly different ways depending on their cultural context. In the Western imagination, minarets are political symbols as much as they are religious architecture. In the Muslim world, they serve as mnemonic devices that enable residents to recognize their own city.","Hamra Abbas, who lives and works in Boston and Islamabad, Pakistan, makes work that has a profound connection to her own cultural context. She asks probing questions about the everyday and its complex relationship with history and ideology; her subject matter ranges from religious rituals to war and the sexual iconography of the Kama Sutra. Working with a diverse range of materials and media, Abbas frequently intertwines the contemporary with the classic to offer up a critique of both modern Western and Islamic cultures.","Cityscapes 1 (boats), 2 (woods)",Middle East & Africa,"['religious.s.01', 'city.n.01', 'shop.n.01', 'glance.n.01', 'imagination.n.01', 'western.a.01', 'direct.a.01', 'symbol.n.01', 'architecture.n.01', 'construction.n.01', 'state.n.04', 'cardinal.s.01', 'fictional_character.n.01', 'context.n.01', 'cultural.a.01', 'question.n.01', 'political.a.01', 'history.n.01', 'photograph.n.01', 'time.n.01']","['erasure.n.02', 'symbol.n.02', 'minaret.n.01', 'religious.n.01', 'european_union.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/hamra_abbas_cityscapes_i_boats.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/hamra_abbas_cityscapes_i_boats-300x66.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/cityscapes-1-boats-2-woods/,"['Material_Physical/1.675', 'Individual_Personal/1.6235294117647059', 'Society/1.6']","['Material_Physical', 'Individual_Personal', 'Society']",4.898529411764706,"['Mind/1.6235294117647059', 'Land/0.875', 'History/0.8']","['Mind', 'Land', 'History']",3.298529411764706,"['Cultural/17.950980392156865', 'Material_Physical/10.995166580925096', 'Individual_Personal/10.023432449903037']","['Cultural', 'Material_Physical', 'Individual_Personal']",38.96957942298499,"['Arts/8.308169934640523', 'Fantasy/5.284640522875817', 'Land/5.22483660130719']","['Arts', 'Fantasy', 'Land']",18.81764705882353,0.6666666666666666,0.3333333333333333
Mario Ybarra Jr.,"Ammo Bunker (2009) is a multipart installation that includes large-scale wall prints and an architectural model.

The facility was later used as a temporary prison to hold different people coming from Mexico to Los Angeles during the Civil War. The building’s walls are covered with different marks and inscriptions from that time—what Ybarra likes to call L.A.’s earliest graffiti and which today coexist with recent gang tags. By pointing out the presence of these two kinds of inscriptions in the same historical place, Ybarra furthers his investigation into the intertwining of Mexican-American and Anglo-American social and cultural histories in Southern California.","Mario Ybarra Jr. belongs to a generation of Mexican-American artists who embrace their double heritage and use it in order to create critical and compelling artistic work. Ybarra is based in Los Angeles, where he grew up, and a large part of his artistic practice has grown out of issues related to his upbringing in the Chicano community of Wilmington. He consistently explores the culture and politics of the West Coast to produce, as he says, contemporary art that is filtered through a Mexican-American experience. Ybarra is not only a multifaceted artist, but also works as an educator, gallerist, activist, and social anthropologist.",Ammo Bunker,Americas,"['los_angeles.n.01', 'war.n.01', 'wall.n.01', 'prison.n.01', 'shop.n.01', 'probe.n.01', 'keep.v.01', 'kind.n.01', 'california.n.01', 'history.n.01', 'native.a.01', 'architectural.a.01', 'mexico.n.01', 'era.n.01', 'print.n.01', 'model.n.01', 'presence.n.01', 'building.n.01', 'historical.a.01', 'cultural.a.01', 'people.n.01', 'piece.n.01', 'social.a.01']","['monument.n.02', 'inscription.n.01', 'chicano.n.01', 'graffito.n.01', 'detention.n.01', 'los_angeles.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/mario_ybarra_jr_ammo_bunker_2009_1_of_3.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/mario_ybarra_jr_ammo_bunker_2009_1_of_3-300x202.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/ammo-bunker/,"['Cultural/8.917582417582418', 'Society/5.31674538911381', 'Material_Physical/3.1483157365510306']","['Cultural', 'Society', 'Material_Physical']",17.38264354324726,"['Urbanization/2.672514619883041', 'Design/2.571428571428571', 'Arts/2.435897435897436']","['Urbanization', 'Design', 'Arts']",7.679840627209048,"['Society/22.95326736387108', 'Material_Physical/13.367435488488123', 'Individual_Personal/12.047511312217196']","['Society', 'Material_Physical', 'Individual_Personal']",48.3682141645764,"['Urbanization/7.454443801812223', 'Land/6.619883040935673', 'History/5.204761904761904']","['Urbanization', 'Land', 'History']",19.279088747509803,0.6666666666666666,0.3333333333333333
Natasha Wheat,"Natasha Wheat’s Kerosene Triptych (2011) is composed of three images, one each from the digital files of the Library of Congress, the Smithsonian Institution, and the Field Museum tropical research archive. The original photographs were taken by anonymous photographers, not as art but as documents of the building of the Panama Canal.  The laborers in the images are holding cans of kerosene and spraying it into the foliage. It was a common practice during the building of the canal for American companies and the military to import black workers from the Antilles Islands to spray kerosene to kill mosquitoes and prevent malaria. This practice resulted in massive health problems for the laborers and the disappearance of many species of local wildlife—not just insects but also plants and animals. With this work, Wheat uncovers and generates a space where the movement of objects (the movement of objects being the function of the Panama Canal) takes priority over life, art, and society itself. The coming together of the three images into a single work stands as abstract documentation of sterilization—both cultural and biological.","Natasha Wheat’s diverse body of work explores social experience as a sensual phenomenon that is riddled with hierarchical complexity. Her objects, installations, and interventions engender and disrupt a full range of interpersonal relations. Wheat was the founder of Project Grow, an art studio and urban farming program based in Portland, Oregon, that employed developmentally disabled adults and investigated the intersection of food, ideology, society, and exchange.

Ian Wallace,"Untitled (Breathless) presents a folded newspaper article on Jean-Luc Godard’s À Bout de Souffle (Breathless). The work uses collage techniques—it is stapled down and has a thick strip of contact sheet paper taped over it—that convert the media coverage on Godard’s film into a filmic object itself. The black paper enacts a kind of cinematic “jump cut” on the article, while simultaneously drawing attention to the medium of the film, as well as the photograph reproduced in this newspaper article. The composition has a casual and dynamic stylishness to it (as do the movie stars lying in bed), which is contradicted somewhat by the static utilitarian aesthetic of the piece’s construction. The tape and staples hold the more dominant visual elements in place and recall printmaking tools.","British-born and Vancouver-based, Ian Wallace is known for his conceptual art practice and critical writings.

Jeff Wall,"As suggested by its title, Pipe Opening (2002) depicts a hole in a wood wall exposed by the removal of a pipe. In contrast to his signature immense tableaux, Pipe Opening is a direct but modest document of a “real” scene that Wall “encountered by chance” in daily life. However factual, the image indicates certain enigmatic significance, allowing multiple interpretations. Wall encourages the viewer to engage with the scenario to imagine the before and the after of the moment. Compared to his earlier work, Wall’s photographs appear to be straight-up snapshots, exhibiting less manipulative details. The fictional details are not conveyed through obvious arrangements but due to the very nature of photographs: What they record is always an incomplete view of the world.","Internationally renowned photoconceptualist Jeff Wall is famous for his large-format lightboxes whose subject matter ranges from figurative portraiture to urban environment to mundane objects to elaborately constructed scenes.

General Idea,"AIDS Ring is a cast metal ring, which takes as its basis Robert Indiana’s iconic “LOVE” design, appropriating its pop aesthetic, and totalizing, simplistic universal messaging to instead emphasize the severity of the AIDS epidemic that occurred in the 1970s. This visual detournement of Indiana’s sculpture into the form of a ring is an indictment of pop art’s apolitical nature, as well as of its increasingly commodified status. General Idea instead proposes that art’s expansive platform for messaging be used to spread awareness and create accountability for political negligence of the AIDS epidemic. The work equates Indiana’s universal message of love, with the devastating affects of the AIDS epidemic; this is just one of the many iterations of the AIDS image that the collective mobilized across a wide array of objects to generate extensive exposure for their message.","The Canadian artist collective General Idea (Felix Partz, Jorge Zontal and AA Bronson), active from 1967-1993, was an instrumental source of early conceptual art through their multidisciplinary practice. Their work often uses conceptual art to critically explore issues such as the myth of the artist, mass media, the body and identity, gender and sexual repression, and the HIV/AIDS epidemic, and in the process, advancing activism. Their AIDS body of work is what they are best known for ; a series of mass-market visualities and practices that drew widespread public attention to the epidemic.

Thiago Honório,"Pau-Brasil is a sculpture referencing Oswald de Andrade’s 1925 classic of Brazilian modernist literature of the same title. De Andrade’s work demands the resuscitation of “Brazilian” language and culture, advocating for the cultivation of invention and an illogical, “agile and candid” attitude. In response, Thiago Honório’s work takes the physical form of a laquered stalk of the pau brasil tree, from which de Andrade’s work drew its title, piercing the physical form of the book itself. Pau brasil wood was highly valued in Europe, giving the work a cyclical quality in it’s juxtaposition of text-based conceptual commodity (made out of paper, the dessicated product of trees) pierced by a physical, natural commodity of the tree itself. This is a fitting meta-synopsis of de Andrade’s work, given his advocacy for a regionalized, pure art, eschewing a photographic or naturalistic approach. What emerges in Honório’s work is a miasmatic sculpture, capriciously representing the complexity of Brazilian literary history and its material aftermath.","Brazil-based artist Thiago Honorio’s primarily sculptural practice takes found or commodified objects and creates complex, visually unusual representations that manipulate the chosen materials against their “intended” purposes. The resulting sculptures reverberate with the past lives of their materials: amongst their contradictory uses, they further develop a matrix of contact between disparate bodies of knowledge and temporalities.

Juliana Huxtable,"Herculine’s Prophecy features a kneeling demon-figure on what appears to be a screen-print, placed on a wooden table, which has then been photographed and digitally altered to appear like a book cover, with a title and subtitle across the top, and a poem written across the bottom. This composition is stuck to a metal plate by a series of button magnets, with interjecting phrases on them. The juxtaposition between the mysogynistic, almost puritan poetry that stripes across the bottom and the powerful crouching pose that the femme demon assumes inverts the hegemonic text , instead creating a space of alterity. The semi-deconstructed book-cover, denotes the seepage of this potential ontological reality (contained within this unwritten book) into the world, allowing Juliana Huxtable’s creation an added layer of possibility.","Writer, artist, performer, and DJ Juliana Huxtable explores intersectional identity through her multidisciplinary practice, which   seamlessly  blurs the lines  that typically separate methods of artistic production. Her work draws from her life experiences, as well as marginalized internet communities, oftentimes featuring hybrid humanoid forms that deeply probe representation of selfhood. In their self-consciously constructed visual ontologies, Huxtable develops a double edged practice that is, on the one hand, a critique of systemic sexist and misogynist power structures, body disassociation and dysmorphia, and on the other, a world-making that frames the radical potential of new technology.

Zhang Kechun,"Zhang Kechun’s series The Yellow River documents the effects of modernization along the eponymous river, the third longest one in Asia. The Yellow River is considered the cradle of Chinese civilisation but also to be a threat, capable of breaking its banks at any time. It is also a region where Buddhism flourished, perhaps because Buddhist monks could not survive in other snowy and freezing northern climates.   Inspired by the novel River of the North by Zhang Chengzhi, the artist traveled on a fold-up bicycle in eastern China’s Shandong province, where the river discharges vast amounts of water into the sea, before slowly tracing it westward over several month-long trips heading to the River’s source near the Bayan Har Mountain in Qinghai. The areas surrounding the river had been devastated by flooding and Zhang attempted to poetically expose the emotional impact on the local population. The photograph depicts a Buddha head abandoned in the middle of a coal mining plant in Ningxia. A coal mine owner had started building a golden statue of a dozen meters but when the Buddha’s head broke, no one wanted to deal with it due to its symbolic significance. Pollution accounts for the foggy ambiance of his washed-out, hazy photograph of the Chinese landscape. Rarely featuring people, with an eerily quiet atmosphere, Zhang’s images show how human activities have altered — sometimes irreversibly — the fragile ecosystems around the Yellow River.   Whilst the project was not initially intended to confront environmental issues, Zhang found that ecological matters became unavoidable and the series hums with melancholy for the lost landscape.","Zhang Kechun produces epic vistas that dwell on the significance of the landscape in modern Chinese national identity, and the interaction between people and nature. His photographs often appear as documentary artefacts that halt the high-speed passage of time for a brief moment. He started painting when he was a child, studied art and design and, on graduating, worked as a designer in Chengdu before becoming interested in photography.",The Yellow River,Asia,"['river.n.01', 'chinese.a.01', 'head.n.01', 'landscape.n.01', 'mountain.n.01', 'population.n.01', 'confront.v.01', 'sea.n.01', 'change.v.01', 'region.n.01', 'matter.n.01', 'activity.n.01', 'plant.n.01', 'china.n.01', 'photograph.n.01', 'effects.n.01', 'water.n.01', 'local.a.01', 'impact.n.01', 'see.v.05', 'symbolic.a.01', 'issue.n.01', 'inspire.v.01', 'document.n.01', 'series.n.01']","['modernization.n.01', 'river.n.01', 'buddhism.n.01', 'statue.n.01', 'deterioration.n.01', 'pollution.n.01', 'environmentalism.n.02', 'sculpture.n.02', 'community.n.01', 'fishing.n.02']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/IMG_ZC_p12.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/IMG_ZC_p12-300x241.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/the-yellow-river/,"['Material_Physical/5.099719887955182', 'Society/3.911222111222111', 'Individual_Personal/3.413675213675214']","['Material_Physical', 'Society', 'Individual_Personal']",12.424617212852507,"['Environmental/4.276190476190476', 'Arts/2.4434124527003784', 'Power/2.307692307692308']","['Environmental', 'Arts', 'Power']",9.027295236583162,"['Cultural/31.983963585434182', 'Individual_Personal/16.92356532356533', 'Politics/15.540659340659346']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Politics']",64.44818824965886,"['Arts/10.625183150183151', 'Culture/7.452014652014651', 'Land/6.200102821155452']","['Arts', 'Culture', 'Land']",24.277300623353256,0.3333333333333333,0.3333333333333333
Ad Minoliti,"Ad Minoliti’s newest works draw directly from her experience in with The Feminist School of Painting in San Francisco. Ideas developed with collaborators and students during the workshops—in particular the History, Landscape, Portrait, and Petit Genre (domestic settings)—are embodied in the vivid cosmic scene depicted in the triptych painting Abstracción Geométrico-Galáctica. A departure from previous bodies of work that explore the modern interiors of 1960’s-era American homes, porn sets, and jungles, Abstracción Geométrico-Galáctica launches her geometric characters into space for the first time. The background image features illustrated propositions for spatial colonies that NASA commissioned from artists during the 1970s, thus exporting the colonial dreams and strategies of the White American Way of Life beyond the terrestrial sphere. In Minoliti’s version, this vision is contaminated by techno-feminist figures occupying a spaceship setting whose design is pulled directly from the animated television show Steven Universe (an Emmy award winning program that premiered on Cartoon Network in 2013—the network’s first show created solely by a woman, and well-known for featuring LGBTQ themes and science fantasy worldbuilding). After exploring the non-human, post-gender alternative universe, the artist is now addressing the future of genres.","Ad Minoliti is a painter who combines the pictorial language of geometric abstraction with the perspective of queer theory. Engaging in a diversity of formats and media from easel painting to installation, she assumes painting not as a mere material practice, but rather as a visual set of ideas to approach normative categories of sexuality and biology. Throughout her work, geometrical forms and surreal landscapes serve to imagine a post-humanist setting in which feminist and gender theories can be applied to an open interpretation of painting, design, and art history.",Abstracción Geométrico-Galáctica,Americas,"['universe.n.01', 'network.n.01', 'american.a.01', 'white.n.01', 'san_francisco.n.01', 'geometric.s.01', 'television.n.01', 'scheme.n.01', 'pull.v.01', 'plan.n.01', 'setting.n.01', 'version.n.01', 'school.n.01', 'picture.v.02', 'dream.n.01', 'fantasy.n.01', 'feature.n.01', 'vision.n.01', 'design.n.01', 'future.n.01', 'modern.a.01', 'set.n.01', 'background.n.01', 'woman.n.01', 'portrayal.n.01']","['feminist_movement.n.01', 'outer_space.n.01', 'national_aeronautics_and_space_administration.n.01', 'colonization.n.01', 'engineering.n.02', 'universe.n.01', 'nonhuman.a.01', 'sex.n.04']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/IMG_GCCœ-2019-Ad-Minoliti-013.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/IMG_GCCœ-2019-Ad-Minoliti-013-300x200.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/abstraccion-geometrico-galactica/,"['Material_Physical/13.26703296703297', 'Cultural/12.605392156862745', 'Individual_Personal/4.258169934640523']","['Material_Physical', 'Cultural', 'Individual_Personal']",30.13059505853624,"['Space/8.47948717948718', 'Arts/4.906862745098039', 'Technology/4.541666666666666']","['Space', 'Arts', 'Technology']",17.928016591251883,"['Material_Physical/18.9940170940171', 'Individual_Personal/18.703250017955906', 'Cultural/17.715485168426348']","['Material_Physical', 'Individual_Personal', 'Cultural']",55.41275228039935,"['Space/9.857264957264958', 'Mind/8.685042735042735', 'Values/4.9378151260504195']","['Space', 'Mind', 'Values']",23.480122818358115,1.0,0.3333333333333333
Ana Vaz,"Há Terra! (There Is Land!) is a short film that picks up on the previous film Idade de Pedra (2013), in which artist Ana Vaz imagined pre-modernity in her native Brasilia. Vaz returns to the young protagonist of Idade de Pedra, Ivonete dos Santos Moraes, who has joined Brazil’s 40-year landless movement that struggles to wrest land from powerful agriculturalists. Ivonete also hails from the region of quilombos, what was once settlements of runaway slaves that resisted the colonizers. Darting camera movements appear to chase Ivonete through the high grass. The present-tense voice-over seems to fuse with the past in the myopia of the long focus lens. The recurrent sound loop of a man shouting “há terra!” (literally: “there is land”) conjures up the distant memory of colonialism. But the beauty of this collage rests on the impossibility for the spectator to let this past “pass”; the current testimony involves a mayor who has taken over the lands of the indigenous people by threat.   As the artist describes her 16mm cine-poem: “Há Terra! is an encounter, a hunt, a diachronic tale of looking and becoming. As in a game, as in a chase, the film errs between character and land, land and character, predator and prey.”","Ana Vaz examines history and territory in her native Brazil through a myriad practice of filmmaking, installation, and performance. Using ethnographic and speculative models, her work evinces the interdependent relationships between colonialism, modernism and the Anthropocene. Through a profusion of intricate and potent portraits of land, animals, and people, Vaz’s approach is germane to denouncing the human devoration or swallowing up of the natural environment and native communities.",Há Terra!,Americas,"['land.n.01', 'fictional_character.n.01', 'motion.n.03', 'movie.n.01', 'lens.n.01', 'region.n.01', 'native.a.01', 'brush.n.06', 'current.a.01', 'beauty.n.01', 'supporter.n.01', 'short.a.01', 'game.n.01', 'collage.n.01', 'sound.n.01', 'memory.n.01', 'camera.n.01', 'people.n.01', 'spectator.n.01', 'narrative.n.01']","['colonialism.n.01', 'temporal.a.02', 'past.n.01', 'present.n.01', 'slave.n.01', 'brazil.n.01', 'agribusiness.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-05-06-at-4.08.48-PM.png,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-05-06-at-4.08.48-PM-300x180.png,https://kadist.org/work/ha-terra/,"['Material_Physical/12.797660818713451', 'Society/6.646434267486899', 'Politics/1.7092731829573933']","['Material_Physical', 'Society', 'Politics']",21.153368269157742,"['Time/7.777777777777778', 'Land/2.6198830409356724', 'Colonization/1.7777777777777777']","['Time', 'Land', 'Colonization']",12.17543859649123,"['Cultural/29.054698895875376', 'Society/14.887324929971992', 'Individual_Personal/14.154609752132977']","['Cultural', 'Society', 'Individual_Personal']",58.09663357798035,"['Media/6.925854700854701', 'Geopolitics/5.629964806435394', 'Fantasy/5.185398098633392']","['Media', 'Geopolitics', 'Fantasy']",17.741217605923488,0.3333333333333333,0.0
Sanya Kantarovsky,"Wrong Currency (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday) uses the stylistic vernacular of five separate artists to create a series of five lithographs, dealing with a series of apparently unrelated happenings, each staged as one “day.” The series takes up Kantarovsky’s theme of embarrassment across a variety of scenes, each populated by multiple figures, set in a disjunctive relation. The visual forms are brought into  conversation through their shared emotional cadence. Kantarovsky proposes an affective affinity beyond style or subject matter.","Artist and curator Sanya Kantarovsky works across mediums to grapple with embarrassment and shame, emphasizing alienation through exposure of that  which is deeply personal. The figures portrayed in the artist’s work are caught in the midst of vulnerability, and interact directly with the edges of the medium at hand, as well as the other denizens of Kantarovsky’s compositions. The works contain a dark humor reminiscent of the occasionally melancholy modern Eastern European literary aesthetic, but also references figures both canonical and on the periphery of art history. As such, Kantarovsky uses this uncanny sense of embarrassment to both refer to his regional heritage, as well as cast a similarly uneasy shadow over the works from which he draws inspiration.","Wrong Currency (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday)",Europe,"['series.n.01', 'capable.s.02', 'bring.v.01', 'matter.n.01', 'conversation.n.01', 'multiple.a.01', 'put.v.01', 'day.n.01', 'relation.n.01', 'artist.n.01', 'subject.n.01', 'manner.n.01', 'ocular.a.02', 'figure.n.01', 'make.v.03', 'scene.n.01', 'form.n.01']","['lithography.n.01', 'stylistic.s.01', 'affect.n.01', 'melancholy.n.01', 'ordinary.n.02', 'habit.n.01', 'temporal.a.02']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Sanya-Katraronvsky3.jpeg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Sanya-Katraronvsky3-235x300.jpeg,https://kadist.org/work/wrong-currency-monday-tuesday-wednesday-thursday-friday/,"['Individual_Personal/20.41055611055611', 'Society/4.833333333333334', 'Cultural/0.8']","['Individual_Personal', 'Society', 'Cultural']",26.043889443889444,"['Emotion/20.41055611055611', 'Violence/3.1410256410256414', 'History/1.6923076923076925']","['Emotion', 'Violence', 'History']",25.243889443889447,"['Material_Physical/6.664402264402264', 'Cultural/4.6461538461538465', 'Society/4.14065934065934']","['Material_Physical', 'Cultural', 'Society']",15.45121545121545,"['Language/3.076923076923077', 'Community/2.571428571428571', 'Time/2.566233766233766']","['Language', 'Community', 'Time']",8.214585414585414,0.6666666666666666,0.0
Annette Kelm,"In Stilleben mid Zierlauch (Still Life with Aluminum) Annette Kelm utilizes visual juxtaposition to bring together a gridded aluminum backdrop, a pot with a vaguely indigenous pattern on it, and two purple dandelions. The aesthetic dissonance  between the mechanical, gridded aluminum and the grainy clay pot signify an interaction between systems of visual production, furthered by the aluminum grid’s inward tilt, visually apparent due to the grid pattern’s convergence at the top of the photograph. Contrasting the stark slant of the grid, the pot sits on a level surface, while the two tall stems protruding from it run at a non-parallel angle to the grid. Though there emerges an uneasy relation between the clearly demarcated individual parts of the composition, its material pluralism is evidence of the work’s conflation of different cultural technologies and functionalities.","Using a conceptually-oriented model of photography, German artist Annette Kelm explores objects and the surrounding nexus of human-driven relations that govern their existence, signification, and function. Her photographs explore systemic structures of capital and history by juxtaposing  disparate genres, such as patterned textiles, designed objects, and technology, within a single work. The clashing motifs of these still life compositions sketch out richly contradictory and cross-cultural narratives, while subverting the stylistic conventions of normative photographic advertisements. Kelm often feature a single, vaguely familiar object, which she renders using a direct and realistic style that oscillates between genres, such as documentary and advertising. She makes series revolving around these objects, pressing the relationship between photography and sculpture—her work moves between the creation of images and the recording of a staged object or objects—in order to unfold her subject’s social, economic, and cultural context.",Stilleben mid Zierlauch (Still Life with Aluminum),Europe,"['grid.n.01', 'ocular.a.02', 'backdrop.n.01', 'bring.v.01', 'form.n.03', 'aesthetic.a.01', 'technology.n.01', 'degree.n.01', 'relation.n.01', 'production.n.01', 'individual.a.01', 'composition.n.01', 'surface.n.01', 'cultural.a.01', 'life.n.01', 'photograph.n.01']","['material.n.01', 'juxtaposition.n.01', 'pluralism.n.02', 'kind.n.01', 'function.n.02', 'aesthetic.a.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Screen-Shot-2020-05-07-at-1.04.50-PM.png,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Screen-Shot-2020-05-07-at-1.04.50-PM-227x300.png,https://kadist.org/work/stilleben-mid-zierlauch-still-life-with-aluminum/,"['Individual_Personal/9.722058823529412', 'Cultural/5.0515701017248995', 'Politics/2.475']","['Individual_Personal', 'Cultural', 'Politics']",17.248628925254312,"['Mind/4.023529411764706', 'Design/2.6280406899601942', 'Spirituality/2.4000000000000004']","['Mind', 'Design', 'Spirituality']",9.0515701017249,"['Cultural/24.988653666594843', 'Society/10.393772893772896', 'Politics/9.460892049127343']","['Cultural', 'Society', 'Politics']",44.843318609495086,"['Arts/8.16336457659987', 'Design/6.65560583207642', 'Media/4.064555052790347']","['Arts', 'Design', 'Media']",18.883525461466636,0.6666666666666666,0.3333333333333333

Burak Delier,"Burak Delier’s sculpture Homage to Balotelli’s Missed Trick is a symbol of resistance to the demand for success and performance. The sculpture represents Italian soccer player Mario Balotelli, who intentionally missed an opportunity to score during a 2011 game between LA Galaxy and Manchester City. The miniature Balotelli stands on his left foot, raising his right foot to kick the ball. As the viewer approaches the piece, Balotelli begins to spin and the noise of a cheering crowd plays from speakers. The noise turns to audible confusion and then booing, tracking the moments during when Balotelli suddenly turned kicked the ball in the opposite direction of the goal.

Anthony McCall,"Landscape for fire is a major work by Anthony McCall. The film recounts a performance where characters in white, light up fires in a very orchestrated choreography of lights in a vast flat landscape. The performance is carefully planned – the fires are lit and geometrically aligned in a precise temporal progression.  The appearance of the characters is preceded by a a horn, playing on our perception of a distant sound, strange and scary, suggesting a limit or a hazard. The crackling of matches, the ignition of gasoline, and the brisk breeze of the wind helps us to feel part of this strange celebration as we face the elements air, earth, and fire. A radical breath streams through the work. The editing of the film multiplies perspective: creation, presence, disappearance inhabit this powerful and original work.","Since the 70s, the British artist Anthony McCall has continued to push the boundaries of art. Exploring the boundaries between cinema and sculpture, he uses light and time as his signature materials. His work spans across drawing, installation, and performance, one of his preferred mediums.  McCall is a key figure of British avant-garde film from the 70s.

John Wood & Paul Harrison,"Board has a deadpan quality worthy of Buster Keaton. With this work, Wood and Harrison create an intimate, formally structured mise-en-scène in which they use their own bodies in interaction with a wooden board. The artists elaborate an orchestration of  the comic consequences of inertia, gravity, and the law of falling bodies in this low-tech physics experiment. Their mix of Conceptual art and slapstick conveys a sense of inspired pranksterism. Board (1993)  is one of the very first works they made in collaboration.","John Wood and Paul Harrison have been working collaboratively since 1993 producing single screen and installation based video works.Their work investigates the relationship between the human figure and architecture, developed through short form video  with particular emphasis on actions being formulated and resolved within a given duration.Wood and Harrison have exhibited extensively in France and the USA. Their works form part of the collections of the Tate, Centre Pompidou and MOMA. Their artistic practice spans the use of the frame, minimal aesthetics, associations of everyday objects and low-tech visual tricks, the making of micro-trivial actions – whose results are invariably between obvious failure and random success.

Ulla von Brandenburg,"Eight opens with a close up of a painting by Hubert Robert of the Chateau de Chamarande where the film was shot. This work  acts as a key to the unfolding film. In Eight, the camera tracks back and forth, proceeding from room to room, closing in on each motif, lingering and then passing on without ‘comment’, as a surrogate for the spectator’s gaze. Each tableau vivant that the camera/viewer encounters recalls some other cultural manifestation: Greek theatre in the mask, Magritte perhaps in the woman with no face, Caspar David Friedrich in the woman gazing out of the window, Greuze in the death scene observed by spectators (but also perhaps 19 century medical demonstrations to students) etc. Many of these motifs recur in von Brandenburg’s work so there is also a sense of self-reference. The film enshrines ambiguity; are these people alive or dead, animate or inanimate wax works? Only the paper that inflates and deflates indicates a living presence. This is the only motif that engages with the cinematic. Everything else is photographic and theatrical. Just as the film is destined to loop eternally (evoked by the moebius strip) so the figures seem to be frozen forever in their poses. However, part of the disquiet occurs in the gap between what we know and what we don’t know. Once the camera has passed do the figures come to life? Before the camera reaches them are they animate? The spectator is caught between worlds, between the conscious and the unconscious, the knowing and not knowing, in a timeless world staged for his inspection.",Ulla von Brandenburg was born in 1974 in Karlsruhe.

Danh Vo,"Good life (2007) is an installation displaying letters, documents, photographs and objects from a man named Joseph Carrier, and appropriated by artist Danh Vo.  The installation features a series of small square vitrines, inset, dark and precisely spot-lit. Inside these are framed photographs, mostly black and white, of young Asian men, taken, as the titles on the neat brass name plates tell us, in Vietnam in the 1960s and early 1970s. In one vitrine, an old-fashioned camera sits propped up on its worn leather case. In another is a typewritten document titled ‘Beliefs, Attitudes and Behaviour of the Lowland Vietnamese’ and a crumpled business card, belonging to one ‘Joseph M. Carrier, National Academy of Sciences’. Presumably Carrier was the owner of the camera, an American in Vietnam during the war on an anthropological rather than a combat mission. We learn while viewing the installation, in the form of letters and correspondence that Carrier and Vo met during a personal exhibition of Vo’s at the Villa Aurora. The fruits of that meeting led Vo to create this archive on Carrier’s subjective experience in the 1960’s and 1970’s, all derived from Carrier’s personal possessions. This work is exemplary for its consideration of the archive and Vo’s incessant attempt to shed light on subdued homosexuality in Vietnam, appropriation, and surrogate biographies.","Danh Vo’s personal history of migration and adjustment is an important reference point for his artistic practice. In his work, he explores themes ranging from identity, authorship, sexuality, and ownership to origin. He uses intimate, personal material to show that identity is a construction of projections, assumptions and attributed values. Vo embarks upon a subtle investigation of the Western fascination for the exotic and unknown with an exquisite conceptual style. For Vo, appropriating the history of others is a way of unraveling monolithic ideas about identity. And he does so with great verve, generally initiating the journey with himself. In addition to his classifiable works, a certain mystified aura lingers around his actions: the artist has married, and subsequently divorced numerous people simply to add their names to his list, he has committed “crimes” later displaying their documentation as show, for example. In his installations he uses objects, photos and documentation that connects his family history to real memories intertwined with a complex imaginary. His refugee status has led him to attempt to reconstruct various derivations of identities, origins, and stories. This requires the questioning of social structures, the endorsement of different identities, the questioning of values, and the undermining of conventions in order set forth a groundwork for his personal depiction in the world of society at large.  Born in 1975, Danh Vo is a Danish artist with Vietnamese origins.

Taroop & Glabel,,"Tarrop & Galbel is a  group of artists working together since 1993 and whose main objective see to challenge the more prevalent social values. Religion, trade in all its forms, the society of easy entertainment and empty spectacle (from sports to theme parks), military orders or media, nothing escapes the furious cynics who work in order to  seem to work for “fool” anything that alienates man and his conscience.Taroops & Glabel’s work is somewhat in keeping with their spirit: working surreptitiously, changing just one word, one comma, one small detail to alter everything. Essentially, their work consists of impeccably produced panels, graphic pages, humorist comic drawings, as well as installations, such as large-scale adhesive plastic letters and drawings. In one piece, the name Jesus Christ is laid out in beautiful black capital letters on a lustrous bronze ground followed by one small clinching detail – a circled R, the symbol for registered, transforming the piece into a sign for a vulgar commercial brand. Such is the impression one gets from Taroop & Glabel: certitudes are shattered, yesterday’s comforting words, maliciously singled-out and laid bare, become ridiculous but no more than the mottos we use today and to which we grant so much importance. Their name is a play on words or rather a lighthearted allusion to the “third eye,” only expressed in French, but then again without certitude. They live and work in Paris and Laffaux.",Condensé,Europe,[],"['temper.n.02', 'society.n.01', 'criticism.n.01', 'medium.n.01', 'commerce.n.01', 'trade.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/img-457_0.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/img-457_0-201x300.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/condense/,"['Society/14.80377933899606', 'Cultural/11.885687351863822', 'Individual_Personal/11.35780885780886']","['Society', 'Cultural', 'Individual_Personal']",38.04727554866874,"['Economy/11.431984467201186', 'Emotion/11.35780885780886', 'Media/5.992647058823529']","['Economy', 'Emotion', 'Media']",28.782440383833574,[],[],0.0,[],[],0.0,,
SUPERFLEX,"SUPERFLEX makes a distinction between two types of projects with different temporalities: works that occur during an exhibition and other that evolved over several years. Thus, since 1997, they are working on a biogas system (SUPERGAS), first installed in Kenya, then Thailand and today in Mexico, perfecting at each stage the means of production, utilization and commercialization of this system. GUARANA POWER is one of these sustainable projects that create a real economy. The story begins in 2003 when SUPERFLEX was invited to Maués by a foundation and the government of the Brazilian state of Amazonas; this led to a collaboration with a cooperative of Guarana farmers. Maués is famous for its Opera shown in the film Fitzcarraldo but also as an industrial area situated in a free zone and housing multinationals such as Toshiba, Samsung or Benetton. During a first workshop with the Guarana farmers, they started discussing how to find common solutions to cultivate and commercialize Guarana without bending to the demands of the multinationals (like Antartica) who exploit the fruit and constantly reduce production costs and therefore labour costs. Thus the farmers’ experience and the concepts introduced by SUPERFLEX lead to the set up of efficient strategies of communication which are regularly perfected to sell the Guarana Power bottles internationally. Right from the beginning of the project, Superflex decided to self-censure itself by using a barred logo following threat by the main multinational. The artwork was also censured by the director of the Sao Paulo Biennale in 2006, which provoked important reporting in the press at the time. More generally, this project poses the question of the role of art and its limitations with regards producing effective consequences in response to a socio-political situation.","SUPERFLEX work on a number of projects linked to their avowed interest in political and social engagement on a local scale. They don’t place themselves in opposition, but they unpick the political, economic and communication strategies that have been put in place in a context in order to make them more visible. SUPERFLEX intervene in places where it appears necessary to implement a “counter-economic” solution by experimenting with means of alternative production. They conceive their project in response to a context, whether it is that of an artistic institution or a social situation and create works that often establish a link between these two realities. The Danish collective was founded in 1993 by Bjørnstjerne Reuter Christiansen (1969), Jakob Fenger (1968) and Rasmus Nielsen (1969).",Guarana Power Commercials,Europe,"['undertaking.n.01', 'production.n.01', 'power.n.01', 'type.n.01', 'scheme.n.01', 'mexico.n.01', 'collaboration.n.01', 'phase.n.01', 'economy.n.01', 'common.a.01', 'put.v.01', 'celebrated.s.01', 'concept.n.01', 'government.n.01', 'situation.n.01', 'artwork.n.01', 'real.a.01', 'function.n.03', 'consequence.n.01', 'experience.n.01', 'question.n.01', 'narrative.n.01', 'movie.n.01', 'time.n.01']","['farmer.n.01', 'agribusiness.n.01', 'exploitation.n.01', 'multinational.s.01', 'corporation.n.01', 'industrialization.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/screen_shot_2012-07-11_at_18.15.25.png,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/screen_shot_2012-07-11_at_18.15.25-300x251.png,https://kadist.org/work/guarana-power-commercials/,"['Society/11.028654970760233', 'Cultural/4.107739938080495', 'Politics/2.6']","['Society', 'Cultural', 'Politics']",17.73639490884073,"['Economy/10.228654970760235', 'Media/2.484210526315789', 'Environmental/1.6159420289855073']","['Economy', 'Media', 'Environmental']",14.328807526061532,"['Cultural/28.0767680032386', 'Individual_Personal/22.703399524452163', 'Politics/16.089535610588246']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Politics']",66.86970313827901,"['Power/7.1885780885780886', 'Culture/7.107692307692308', 'Media/6.435470085470085']","['Power', 'Culture', 'Media']",20.73174048174048,0.6666666666666666,0.3333333333333333
Anri Sala,"Ghost Games, follows the enigmatic dance of crabs “steered” by a flashlight in the night of darkness of a South American beach. The video produces a surreal impression, typical of Sala’s work, with no plot in the classical sense, no story being told. Like in Blindfold (2002), in which a sunrise is reflected in urban billboards, and Time After Time (2001), in which the figure of a horse emerges from darkness lit by the headlights of an automobile, Sala likes to explore the phenomenon of light and its effects; In Ghost Games, he uses the threatening reflection of the flash light through the darkness of the beach. But unlike several of Sala’s videos’ deliberately slow style, where sometimes the camera does not even move at all, this film is punctuated by the erratic moves of the monster-like creature , its ghostly disappearances into sand holes; the crab’s occasional encounters with the feet of unidentified people standing in the sand, at times like an aggressive dance of protagonists, dramatically adds to the creepy feeling of the scene.","Anri Sala received a degree in painting from the Academy of Fine Arts in that city, and went on to study at the Ecole Nationale Supérieure des Arts Décoratifs in Paris and at the Le Fresnoy, Studio National des Arts Contemporains in Tourcoing (film and video). His work has been exhibited at the Venice Biennale, the Berlin Biennale, the Manifesta 3 in Ljubljana and in numerous solo and group exhibitions. He combines techniques from two realms of art, the moving image and painting. His captivating visual projects on the one hand constitute a penetrating analysis of culture and the human condition as determined by place and political context, and on the other an exploration of the language of imagery, codes of visual communication and structures of film narration. Many of his projects relate to the identity of individuals who function at the fringes of multiple cultures.  Anri Sala was born in 1974 in Tirana, Albania.

Deliberately, he chooses painting as an instrument to create an oscillation between photo realism and free imagination.

Damián  Ortega,,"Damián Ortega is one of the most prominent artists of the new Mexican generation. Ortega’s work explores specific economic, aesthetic and cultural situations and in particular how regional culture affects commodity consumption.

Paul McCarthy,"Memory Mistake of the Eldridge Cleaver Pants was created for the show Paul McCarthy’s Low Life Slow Life Part 1, held at California College of the Arts’s Wattis Institute in 2008 and curated by McCarthy himself. In homage to an influence in his early career, McCarthy attempted to reconstruct a pair of pants worn by Black Panther revolutionary Eldridge Cleaver in a picture that appeared in Rolling Stone magazine in the 1970s. But in the process, McCarthy misremembered their original design of the pants, which had black outer panels and white inner panels in white, and left a black shape highlighted in the crotch area. Instead, McCarthy’s reconstruction divides the pants vertically in two black and white sections. McCarthy’s mistake speaks not only of the fallibility of memory but of a certain kind of queerness that resists any categorical—“black or white”—definition. Memory Mistake’s use of aesthetic formalism, error, subjectivity, and social history can be seen to challenge the tropes of modernism and art history.","Known for his transgressive performance art pieces that often challenge social conventions, Paul McCarthy is undoubtedly one of the main figures in the West Coast contemporary art scene. Using different forms from pop culture as source material, McCarthy casts a critical look at American society and consumerism. With a particularly poignant sense humor, his works also investigate the intricacies of human psychology.",Memory Mistake of the Eldridge Cleaver Pants,Americas,"['black.a.01', 'white.a.01', 'black.a.01 white.a.01', 'memory.n.01', 'magazine.n.01', 'california.n.01', 'history.n.01', 'pair.n.01', 'life.n.01', 'black.n.01', 'aesthetic.a.01', 'rock.n.01', 'design.n.01', 'picture.n.01', 'original.s.01', 'shape.n.01', 'procedure.n.01', 'make.v.03', 'social.a.01']","['black_panther.n.01', 'misremember.v.01', 'reconstruction.n.02', 'mass_culture.n.01', 'phallic.s.02', 'binary.s.02']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/paul_mccarthy_memory_mistake_2008.gif,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/paul_mccarthy_memory_mistake_2008-200x300.gif,https://kadist.org/work/memory-mistake-of-the-eldridge-cleaver-pants/,"['Society/1.631469979296066', 'Material_Physical/1.5396825396825395', 'Cultural/0.9473684210526315']","['Society', 'Material_Physical', 'Cultural']",4.118520940031237,"['Culture/0.9473684210526315', 'Urbanization/0.8695652173913043', 'Time/0.7777777777777778']","['Culture', 'Urbanization', 'Time']",2.5947114162217138,"['Cultural/30.598553276265633', 'Material_Physical/16.242302142302144', 'Individual_Personal/10.898778998779001']","['Cultural', 'Material_Physical', 'Individual_Personal']",57.73963441734678,"['Media/9.540006501926007', 'Arts/8.765196078431373', 'Space/6.346153846153846']","['Media', 'Arts', 'Space']",24.651356426511228,0.6666666666666666,0.0

Matt Lipps,"Untitled (Women) (2011) presents a startlingly succinct history of violently romanticized femininity. Matt Lipps created this diptych by photographing a single arrangement of cutouts. As in his analogous portrait of men, the middle section appears twice, on either side of the split, signaling a stutter, a caesura, or a schizophrenic break. Within the cluster, fashion photography exists alongside frescoes, and demure piety butts up against unabashed sexuality. The women are bound not only by a fuchsia floodlight but also by a shared history. Western conceptions of beauty and eroticism are shown to sample widely and gluttonously, from tribal dance to a cowl-necked sweater.","Matt Lipps is a photographer whose strategies extend to include sculpture and installation. In his series Home (2008), jagged rocks and threatening ice floes impinge upon life-size domestic interiors. In a body of work entitled ‘70s (2004-2006), Lipps rephotographed 1970s male pornography, carefully lifting the models from their magazine pages, backing them with cardboard, and repositioning them amid contemporary, stage-lit bedspreads.

Tim Lee,"In the film Untitled (Buster Keaton, 1897) (2010), we see Tim Lee fall down a flight of stairs, referencing a pivotal story from Buster Keaton’s life: At the age of 18 months, he rolled down a flight of stairs, casually shrugged it off, and was then and there christened with the nickname “Buster” by Harry Houdini. Lee’s film is spliced together from multiple takes of him actually rolling his way up a staircase.

Lee completes the effect by mounting the 16-millimeter projector on a specially constructed stepped sculpture.","Vancouver-based artist Tim Lee employs a wide range of media, including photography, video, installation, and performance to revisit and reinterpret—often humorously—particular historical moments through a constellation of references.","Untitled (Buster Keaton, 1897)",Americas,"['age.n.01', 'movie.n.01', 'multiple.a.01', 'construct.v.01', 'sculpture.n.01', 'narrative.n.01', 'life.n.01']","['slapstick.n.01', 'impersonation.n.03', 'iconography.n.01', 'celebrity.n.01', 'reenactment.n.01', 'reinterpretation.n.02']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/tim_lee_untitled_buster_keaton.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/tim_lee_untitled_buster_keaton-300x297.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/untitled-buster-keaton-1897/,"['Cultural/19.319247874588438', 'Individual_Personal/7.165914786967418', 'Society/6.436363636363637']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Society']",32.92152629791949,"['Arts/10.402978033318591', 'Media/4.236904761904762', 'History/3.2363636363636363']","['Arts', 'Media', 'History']",17.876246431586992,"['Cultural/12.814763177998472', 'Material_Physical/4.213675213675214', 'Individual_Personal/3.4666666666666672']","['Cultural', 'Material_Physical', 'Individual_Personal']",20.495105058340354,"['Arts/6.800116713352007', 'Media/3.327777777777778', 'Materiality/2.435897435897436']","['Arts', 'Media', 'Materiality']",12.563791927027221,0.6666666666666666,0.6666666666666666

Tony Labat,"Commissioned by the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art and riffing on the “I Want You” army recruitment campaigns of the 1930s and 1940s, Labat asked Bay Area residents to interpret the slogan and make their own demands of the public in a series of live performance auditions. Given one minute to seize the voice of authority, contestants were asked to be the finger-pointing Uncle Sam, and their performances—as on the TV program American Idol—were voted on by a live audience. Five winners were chosen and their image and slogans appeared on posters throughout San Francisco to coincide with the presidential elections.

George Kuchar,"Burrito Bay is a video by George Kuchar that follows the format of a diary or travelogue centered on a tropical trip to Acapulco, Mexico. The footage was filmed during the production of Tropical Vulture, a cross-generational collaborative project between George Kuchar and his then student, Mexican artist Miguel Calderón. The video strays away from the conventions of documentary: Kuchar adds an array of effects such as fadeouts between scenes, overlaid digital shapes traversing across the frame, and a strange, unexpected soundtrack. These effects, together with the lack of a cohesive narrative, give Burrito Bay a dream-like, surreal quality that is commonplace in his work. Whether through scenes of roadside urinating, the group lounging in the poolside, preparing breakfast or staying indoors on a rainy day, Burrito Bay gives us a glimpse into Kuchar himself and the inner workings of his mind.","George Kuchar was a key figure in experimental and independent filmmaking in the Bay Area and more broadly across America. He gained prominence through his Super 8 and 16mm films produced throughout the 50s, 60s and 70s. Some of his most well-known titles such as Hold Me While I’m Naked (1966) gave him international recognition and legendary status in underground cinema. In the 1980s, after more than three decades of working with film, Kuchar transitioned to video, and subsequently created hundreds of low-fi, diaristic videos that oscillated between real life and fiction. Many of these camcorder pieces featured Kuchar or his friends as actors, and he also regularly collaborated his students from the San Francisco Art Institute. Throughout his very prolific output of over 350 films, Kuchar was known for pushing the limits of film and cinematic tradition, and for creating a distinct visual language that was joyously nonsensical and reflected his extraordinary humor and wit. Whether featuring UFOs, weather, defecating, urinating, or forbidden passions—Kuchar embedded his eccentric videos with himself, often at his most intimate and profound.",Burrito Bay,Americas,"['effects.n.01', 'scene.n.01', 'mind.n.01', 'documentary.n.01', 'glance.n.01', 'film.v.01', 'strange.a.01', 'mexico.n.01', 'format.n.01', 'footage.n.01', 'digital.a.01', 'day.n.01', 'video.n.01', 'production.n.01', 'quality.n.01', 'frame.n.01', 'shape.n.01', 'undertaking.n.01', 'narrative.n.01']","['remains.n.01', 'malfunction.n.01', 'diary.n.01', 'loss.n.03', 'surfboard.v.01', 'travel.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/george_kuchar_burrito_bay.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/george_kuchar_burrito_bay-300x221.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/burrito-bay/,"['Cultural/6.354700854700854', 'Politics/3.3087719298245615', 'Material_Physical/3.2706043956043955']","['Cultural', 'Politics', 'Material_Physical']",12.934077180129812,"['Language/3.0854700854700856', 'Geopolitics/2.508771929824561', 'Arts/1.6666666666666667']","['Language', 'Geopolitics', 'Arts']",7.260908681961314,"['Cultural/15.09805880394116', 'Individual_Personal/13.582698003750636', 'Politics/13.391330891330895']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Politics']",42.07208769902269,"['Land/5.850652271704903', 'Power/4.676923076923077', 'Mind/3.797979797979798']","['Land', 'Power', 'Mind']",14.325555146607778,0.6666666666666666,0.0
Desiree Holman,"Reborn, 2010 is a three-channel video by Desiree Holman that questions ideas of motherhood and the maternal instinct. The video features a group of women as they tenderly cradle lifelike baby dolls atop their rocking chairs. Although at first, the video might appear as a celebration of the maternal bond, the scene soon becomes eerie and unsettling as we see milk spilling out of the mothers’ mouths. Subsequently, the tone changes dramatically as a group of women in their underwear wearing colorful, bedazzled niqabs, perform an upbeat choreography with the dolls strapped around their bodies.  The work is based on Holman’s research into the curious subculture of ‘reborners,’ a group of women known for hand-making, collecting and caring for hyper-realistic baby dolls called ‘reborns.’ Grounded in fantasy, the vernacular surrounding these dolls often addresses them as living. Fascinated by this, the dolls we see in Hollman’s video were created by the artist in a process that lasted over a year, which involved rooting each individual hair and painstakingly modeling their skin tones.  Reborn is emblematic of Holman’s practice, which, through an anthropologic eye, aims at finding the fissures in established cultural tropes. As per other works by the artist, Reborn disrupts idyllic representations and conventions to bring to the fore the darker, strange and unsettling undertones of human nature.","Combining research, performance, video, digital manipulation, drawing, and installation, Desiree Holman’s multifaceted practice dissects the discourses that structure our shared experience of the social world: from ideas of gender and sexuality to notions of race and motherhood among many others.  Originally trained as a sculptor, the Oakland-based artist places emphasis on objects due to their potential as repositories of meaning. With the help of performers, she then puts these objects to use as costumes or props in performances that the artist describes as “identity play-focused work.” Although Holman generally presents the performances as multi-channel videos, her oeuvre also incorporates traditional gallery works such as drawings and paintings, which a related to the videos on display.  The source material informing her work is often based in her real-world research, pulling apart and interrogating social constructs she finds in popular culture and subcultures, in order to excavate social myths and illustrate the complexity of human psyche.",Reborn,Americas,"['tone.n.01', 'woman.n.01', 'video.n.01', 'hair.n.01', 'mother.n.01', 'eye.n.01', 'perform.v.01', 'life.n.02', 'strange.a.01', 'bring.v.01', 'fantasy.n.01', 'name.v.01', 'individual.a.01', 'representation.n.01', 'establish.v.08', 'idea.n.01', 'nature.n.01', 'practice.n.01', 'cultural.a.01', 'human.a.01', 'procedure.n.01', 'question.n.01', 'make.v.03', 'scene.n.01', 'body.n.01']","['maternal.a.01', 'illusion.n.02', 'lifelike.s.02', 'feminism.n.01', 'sex.n.04', 'doll.n.01', 'motherhood.n.01', 'bind.v.02']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/desiree_holman_reborn.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/desiree_holman_reborn-300x200.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/reborn/,"['Individual_Personal/11.012815126050421', 'Cultural/2.4162895927601813', 'Politics/0.875']","['Individual_Personal', 'Cultural', 'Politics']",14.304104718810603,"['Mind/4.13781512605042', 'Values/2.4000000000000004', 'Body/1.875']","['Mind', 'Values', 'Body']",8.41281512605042,"['Individual_Personal/42.46812109459169', 'Cultural/32.37215578539109', 'Society/19.896448322918918']","['Individual_Personal', 'Cultural', 'Society']",94.7367252029017,"['Culture/14.168772893772893', 'Mind/13.324358974358974', 'Spirituality/11.238267614738202']","['Culture', 'Mind', 'Spirituality']",38.731399482870074,0.6666666666666666,0.3333333333333333

Her prolific body of work spans over four decades: from her early conceptual and performance works where she constructed an ‘official’ civilian record for her alter ego Roberta Breitmore, to her more recent works that intersect with the field of science to explore themes of identity, privacy, surveillance and the complex relationship between humans and technology, and the real and the virtual world. Hershman Leeson also addresses these key themes through her filmmaking, which is highly idiosyncratic and socially engaged.

Kate Gilmore,"In the six-minute single-channel video Higher Horse, Kate Gilmore perches herself on top of a tall pile of plaster blocks, in front of a pink colored wall with vein-like streaks of red. Two muscular men with sledgehammers simultaneously pummel the blocks where Gilmore attempts to stand. Although we can only see the artist from the waist down, her body language reveals apprehension: her hands, tense, press against the wall in an attempt to maintain balance while the men come dangerously close to smashing her bare legs. Gilmore’s attire—red heels, a black skirt, and a pink top—together with the pink walls, are all symbolically charged as expressions of the female gender. The aggressive actions we see in Higher Horse are consistent with her investigation into the language of damage, destruction and rage, which in this case, is inflicted by the male body as she attempts to remain above, unharmed.","Whether through live or filmed performances, or sculptural works where we can see traces of  actions, Kate Gilmore’s practice always departs from the female body. Through her own physicality, and often using the language of destruction and rage, she creates works that bring into question social constructs relating to sex, gender, and most specifically, femininity. Although early in her career she often placed herself as the central protagonist, over the past few years she has invited other women to perform her pieces, and in some instances has even relied on audiences to activate works. A common feature of her work is the use feminine signifers—high heels, skirts, floral patterns, and specific color hues—which are set in stark contrast with physically demanding actions that are aggressive in nature and would commonly be associated with a masculine ethos. By tearing dry walls with sledge hammers, bashing cubes of metal and plaster, smashing glass containers full of paint—Gilmore’s gestures embody a form of resistance seeking to break free from the norms that constrict femininity, all of this articulated through and from the female body.",Higher Horse,Americas,"['block.n.01', 'wall.n.01', 'language.n.01', 'body.n.01', 'probe.n.01', 'female.a.01', 'keep.v.01', 'destruction.n.01', 'hands.n.01', 'expression.n.01', 'red.s.01', 'attempt.n.01', 'action.n.01', 'black.a.01', 'video.n.01']","['femininity.n.01', 'instability.n.02', 'obstacle.n.01', 'gender.n.01', 'destruction.n.01', 'fury.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/kategilmore_higherhorse.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/kategilmore_higherhorse-300x271.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/higher-horse/,"['Individual_Personal/6.7374847374847375', 'Society/6.602446828533785', 'Material_Physical/3.375910364145658']","['Individual_Personal', 'Society', 'Material_Physical']",16.71584193016418,"['Emotion/5.15970695970696', 'Violence/3.983399209486166', 'Environmental/1.7523809523809524']","['Emotion', 'Violence', 'Environmental']",10.895487121574078,"['Society/24.885841211928177', 'Cultural/20.103174603174608', 'Politics/13.722832722832724']","['Society', 'Cultural', 'Politics']",58.71184853793551,"['Space/6.346153846153846', 'Economy/5.598168498168498', 'Arts/4.741025641025641']","['Space', 'Economy', 'Arts']",16.685347985347985,0.3333333333333333,0.0

Felipe Dulzaides,"I Am Cuba—“Soy Cuba” in Spanish; “Ya Kuba” in Russian—is a Soviet/Cuban film produced in 1964 by director Mikhail Kalatozov at Mosfilm. The movie was not well received by the Russian or Cuban public and was almost completely forgotten until its rediscovery thirty years later by American filmmakers. The movie’s acrobatic tracking shots and idiosyncratic mise-en-scène prompted Hollywood directors like Martin Scorsese to campaign to restore the movie in the early 1990s. In 2006, Dulzaides traveled to Cuba to remake a small part of the film which became Scene I Am Cuba, a two-fold narrative in which one story line is based on a real event, and the other is the process of turning evidence into the theatrical.","Felipe Dulzaides studied drama at the Instituto Superior de Arte of Havana and received a MFA in New Genres from the San Francisco Art Institute. A poetic and metaphoric sensibility underlies his practice, which ranges from single-channel videos to video installations and documentaries.  Some of his works begin with actions executed for the camera; others use autobiographical experiences to illustrate the emotional stress of cultural displacement or to reveal memory as an unstable process of endless revision. Dulzaides oscillates between his American and Cuban identities, and he views his bicultural background as a bridge.

Yin-Ju CHEN,"Through a semi-fictional approach, Extrastellar Evaluations envisions a version of history in which alien inhabitants, the Lemurians, lived among humans under the guise of various renowned conceptual and minimal artists in the 1960s (Carl Andre, Mel Bochner, and James Turrell to name a few). If humans interpreted and appropriated the geometric-shaped works they created as conceptual and minimalist artworks, the objects were in fact transmission devices the Lemurians used to report back on human actions to their mother planet. The video takes the form of a channeled message from Adama, High Priest and spiritual leader of the Lemurians.

John Gerrard,"Flag (Thames) 2016 depicts a small section of the Thames River—one that is adjacent to the Palace of Westminster in London—as an algorithmic representation on an LED panel. The river color is vividly represented with reflections of buildings along the riverbank, including Big Ben. At the center of the scene sits a simulated gasoline spill. The depiction accurately refracts the light and creates a vivid prismatic patch, endlessly shifting in shape over time and appearing in direct relation to the precise time of day in London. The point-of-view of the camera in the work circles this changing shape, as Flag (Thames) unfolds over a 365-day solar cycle of night and day. The soft undulation of the waves animates the scene and gives rise to the title of the work.  The power of Flag (Thames) lies in its simplicity. It embodies all of the strengths of his larger work, but its technical and conceptual complexity are manageable. (The oil spill alludes to the artist’s longstanding interest in addressing the perniciousness of the oil industry.) His work can be described as existing in post-cinematic, non-linear time, sequences produced and discarded in the time it takes the computer to execute the complex codes in which they are written. His work both transcends and immortalizes their subjects.","For more than two decades, John Gerrard has produced media work that has harnessed the emergent technologies of programming languages and gaming engines, and transmuted them into landscapes and portraits of ever increasing intricacy and autonomy. Gerrard works with a small team and creates complex algorithmic generators of simulated images. His projects exist as pieces of software. That piece of software needs a powerful machine, such as a gaming-type of machine. While some of his work are manifested as a projection, others exist as an object, or as an LED wall. The only place his art cannot exist is online, because his scenes are too dense and too complex to function in that space at present.     Born 1974 in Ireland, John Gerrard received a degree in sculpture from the Ruskin School at the University of Oxford in 1997. He went on to pursue graduate studies at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago and at Trinity College, Dublin. He has spent twenty years going beyond the artificial look of 3D animation, beyond what Hito Steyerl and Ed Atkins leave as recognizable. Instead, Gerrard’s work speaks to the present as well as to the histories of photography, and even to the histories of cinema.",Flag (Thames) 2016,Europe,"['flag.n.01', 'oil.n.01', 'day.n.01', 'shape.n.01', 'time.n.01', 'scene.n.01', 'wave.n.01', 'river.n.01', 'complexity.n.01', 'represent.v.01', 'direct.a.01', 'conceptual.s.01', 'night.n.01', 'sequence.n.01', 'relation.n.01', 'complex.a.01', 'write.v.01', 'contemplation.n.02', 'center.n.01', 'color.n.01', 'building.n.01', 'light.n.01', 'representation.n.01', 'power.n.01', 'camera.n.01']","['industry.n.01', 'urban.a.01', 'environment.n.01', 'movement.n.03', 'computer.n.01', 'algorithm.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_SP-GERRARDJ230a-WEB.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_SP-GERRARDJ230a-WEB-300x300.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/flag-thames-2016/,"['Cultural/5.320261437908496', 'Material_Physical/5.239926739926739', 'Society/4.347008547008547']","['Cultural', 'Material_Physical', 'Society']",14.907196724843782,"['Technology/4.431372549019608', 'Time/2.45970695970696', 'War/2.347008547008547']","['Technology', 'Time', 'War']",9.238088055735115,"['Material_Physical/24.998920687155987', 'Individual_Personal/21.199291497975718', 'Cultural/12.228870252554463']","['Material_Physical', 'Individual_Personal', 'Cultural']",58.427082437686174,"['Mind/7.750573549257759', 'Time/7.694438894438894', 'Land/4.615384615384616']","['Mind', 'Time', 'Land']",20.06039705908127,0.6666666666666666,0.3333333333333333

Here, Satt presents a conceptual video of intense observation of hands as a cultural signals by filming the manipulation of materials involved in various labor and tasks—counting money, cutting nails, peeling vegetables. While the faces of the filmed subjects are obscured, their identities and psychological expression reside in their quasi-ritualistic repetition of hand gestures as they perfect their particular craft with care. As the film ends with shots of hands patting a pregnant belly, the simple stroking points to the way minute gestures in the most mundane contexts can become responsible for the ultimate miracle of life.","Moe Satt is a Burmese visual and performance artist who uses his own body as a symbolic field for exploring self, identity, embodiment, and political resistance.

In his artistic practice, Harrison is interested in mining available—often commercialized—forms of African culture, looking at these artifacts from the point of view of an urban African American in the twenty-first century.",Hole #1,Americas,"['hole.n.01', 'box.n.01', 'africa.n.01', 'representation.n.01', 'culture.n.01']","['race.n.03', 'culture.n.01', 'identity.n.01', 'loss.n.01', 'colonialism.n.01', 'anthropology.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/large.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/large-300x225.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/hole-1/,"['Society/7.773418394471026', 'Cultural/7.4040100250626555', 'Individual_Personal/6.640085061137693']","['Society', 'Cultural', 'Individual_Personal']",21.817513480671373,"['Identity/5.7979797979797985', 'History/2.682539682539683', 'Physics/2.361904761904762']","['Identity', 'History', 'Physics']",10.842424242424244,"['Individual_Personal/10.466666666666669', 'Cultural/7.495604395604396', 'Material_Physical/2.7032967032967035']","['Individual_Personal', 'Cultural', 'Material_Physical']",20.66556776556777,"['Mind/4.9282051282051285', 'Culture/3.269230769230769', 'Media/2.5692307692307694']","['Mind', 'Culture', 'Media']",10.766666666666667,0.6666666666666666,0.0
Nandan Ghiya,"The Chair (2012) foregrounds media-based tensions between analog and digital imaging technologies as a means of challenging the continued circulation of visual ephemera from India’s colonial past. A mix of found photographs and staged studio portraits deliberately made to look older, The Chair features multiple portraits of figures dressed in period costumes that reference the ornate fashions popular during Great Britain’s imperial rule of India. A hybrid frame wraps around this assemblage, a composite of variously ornate and simple wood finishes culled from disused and forgotten pictures. For each portrait, Ghiya obstructs the subject’s face with hand-painted squares resembling pixels, a gesture of willful obfuscation that renders the colonial subject anonymous while also drawing attention to the subtle but inherent violence of image taking. In using elements from both analog and digital photography, The Chair challenges the imagery and stereotypes of colonial India through contemporary digital technology, blurring the line between the historical and the contemporary, the past and the present. But if Ghiya investigates the issue of individuality in recent colonial past times and its successive iterations in a digital world, he also utilizes his practice as a means to reveal how all representation is effectively manipulated. His hand-painted pixels are more than just gestures towards an historical shift from analog to digital – they are marks of a decisive intervention and a reminder that all images are, in effect, produced by multiple layers of construction, artifice, and variant meaning.","Nandan Ghiya is an emerging whose practice explores the disjunction between various forms of image-based media. Although he received no formal training, his mixed media works reveal a savvy understanding of the function that photographs play in defining our perception of cultural and collective narratives. In juxtaposing found studio portraits alongside digitally manipulated images, Ghiya examines how advances in media-based technologies define our contemporary modes of perception while also threatening genealogies of rich indigenous histories. His work could be seen in conversation with artistic traditions of assemblage and collage. His deliberate commitment to handwork with acrylic, however, also suggests a deeper commitment to multidisciplinary practices that don’t entirely refute artistic traditions but instead utilize them to draw out more trenchant conversations about the erasure of cultural identities and modernism’s displacement of a traumatic colonial past.",The Chair,Middle East & Africa,"['digital.a.01', 'imagination.n.02', 'capable.s.02', 'multiple.a.01', 'portrayal.n.01', 'technology.n.01', 'gesture.n.01', 'historical.a.01', 'contemporary.s.01', 'square.n.01', 'rule.n.01', 'wood.n.01', 'gathering.n.01', 'anonymous.a.01', 'times.n.01', 'shift.n.01', 'uncover.v.01', 'intervention.n.01', 'picture.n.01', 'layer.n.01', 'tension.n.01', 'studio.n.01', 'popular.a.01', 'attention.n.01', 'produce.v.01']","['india.n.01', 'colonialism.n.01', 'dehumanization.n.01', 'anonymity.n.01', 'imperialism.n.01', 'history.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/the_chair_web.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/the_chair_web-300x268.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/the-chair/,"['Society/10.061152882205516', 'Material_Physical/6.714408123696049', 'Politics/1.7092731829573933']","['Society', 'Material_Physical', 'Politics']",18.484834188858958,"['Colonization/4.301587301587301', 'Land/2.6198830409356724', 'Time/2.5326203208556146']","['Colonization', 'Land', 'Time']",9.454090663378588,"['Cultural/17.219092508798393', 'Individual_Personal/12.527926811750344', 'Society/12.05546967652231']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Society']",41.80248899707105,"['Arts/5.759213172448466', 'Design/5.510306686777275', 'Time/5.02233893557423']","['Arts', 'Design', 'Time']",16.29185879479997,0.3333333333333333,0.3333333333333333
Naoya Hatakeyama,"Naoya Hatakeyama’s series Rikuzentakata (2011) documents the devastating aftermath of the 2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami in Japan. Throughout the series of sixty C-prints, Hatakeyama’s photographs depict scenes of torn landscapes and leveled homes, demolished villages and massive piles of detritus pummeled beyond recognition. The images serve as records of disaster, seemingly driven by an intense need to bear witness to collective trauma. Hatakeyama’s photographs, however, emerged from a painful and personal grief: the series focuses on the near-destruction of the artist’s hometown, an event which resulted in both his mother’s death and the deaths of many friends and neighbors. Rikuzentakata bears the ethical weight and responsibility of photojournalism even as its genesis comes out of a deeply felt loss and the ambiguity of survivor’s guilt. Hatakeyama suggests that what’s lost can never be fully recovered, but that with time, those wounds can slowly heal and life can begin again.","Naoya Hatakeyama is one of Japan’s leading contemporary photographers. His work frequently explores the relationship between natural and built environments, and he is particularly invested in examining how urbanization produces violent effects in surrounding landscapes. In 2012, Hatakeyama was the subject of a mid-career retrospective at SFMOMA titled Naoya Hatakeyama: Natural Stories, an exhibition of large-scale photographs centered around themes of nature, destruction, and human will. His photographs have been acquired by many international collections such as the National Museum of Modern Art, Osaka; the National Museum of Modern Art, Tokyo; Tokyo Metropolitan Museum of Photography; the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston; Yale University Art Gallery, New Haven; the Swiss Foundation for Photography, Winterthur; la Maison Européenne de la Photographie, Paris; and the Victoria & Albert Museum, London.",2011.4.4 Kesen-cho,Asia,"['death.n.01', 'witness.n.01', 'series.n.01', 'mother.n.01', 'japan.n.01', 'record.n.01', 'loss.n.01', 'injury.n.01', 'bear.v.01', 'document.n.01', 'personal.a.01', 'event.n.01', 'scene.n.01', 'landscape.n.01', 'life.n.01', 'photograph.n.01', 'time.n.01', 'image.n.01']","['calamity.n.01', 'destruction.n.01', 'mortality.n.01', 'debris.n.01', 'catastrophe.n.02', 'injury.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/2011_04_04.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/2011_04_04-300x240.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/kesen-cho-2/,"['Society/6.0024468285337855', 'Material_Physical/5.308053221288515', 'Individual_Personal/1.6198830409356724']","['Society', 'Material_Physical', 'Individual_Personal']",12.930383090757973,"['Environmental/3.6273809523809524', 'Violence/3.383399209486166', 'Time/1.6806722689075628']","['Environmental', 'Violence', 'Time']",8.691452430774682,"['Material_Physical/16.593406593406595', 'Cultural/16.320227321697914', 'Individual_Personal/10.29570721675985']","['Material_Physical', 'Cultural', 'Individual_Personal']",43.20934113186436,"['Time/4.206593406593407', 'Land/4.164835164835164', 'Materiality/4.093040293040294']","['Time', 'Land', 'Materiality']",12.464468864468863,0.6666666666666666,0.3333333333333333

Nazgol Ansarinia,"In the early 2000s, as urban redevelopment accelerated and intense construction significantly diminished public space in Tehran, state-funded murals began to represent imaginary landscapes on building facades. The municipality of Tehran uses such pictorial representation to to exert influence over and come to terms with the flow of communal desire. The protrusion of the unreal onto the real interrupts the values, independence, and functionality of one over the other. It is not uncommon, for example, to find a Kashan-style house with a courtyard painted on one side of a three-story building, a Yazd-style windtower depicted on the other side of a newly built apartment complex, or rows of painted adobe structures on retaining walls girding the expressway. Fabrications, a series of architectural models that have no equivalent in reality, gives such forms a chance to realize themselves in the third dimension. The model–a constructed fiction–explores the contested space between tradition and modernity, a binary that continues to consume the artist’s culture, identity, and imagination.","Nazgol Ansarinia dissects, interrogates, and recasts networks, objects, and events to draw out relationships to the contemporary Iranian experience.

Nicolás Grum,"El gran pacto de Chile (The Great Pact) and La balserita de Puerto Gala (The Raft) were part of the “Museo Futuro”, an exhibition in which the artist presented nine miniature dioramas staging fragments of Chile’s history, from its colonial invasions to the present. Through the episodes he chose to depict, the artist focused on historical narratives, the way the story is told, and the supposed irrefutability of historical facts.  Museo Futuro (“Future Museum”) stands within a tradition of artists who re-read history and offer their interpretation of it through the distopic lens of the museum display. “Future Museum is the vision of a fuzzy present seen from the distance of an impossible place,” says the artist. Playing with the way the mass media have represented certain of these events that compose Chilean history, and how this has engraved collective memory, the artist sets an ambiguous light of these “official” narratives, ranging from natural disasters, the decadence of art, politics, deceit and forgetfulness.  The use of an old fashioned media, miniature maquettes, evokes obsolete museology in an age where realistic images are omnipresent. It questions the format of representation, the museification of the present and the impact these events have on popular culture.","Through a variety of media (video, drawing, sculpture and installations), Nicolás Grum explores with a touch of sarcasm and humor, the dominant discourses coming from different circles of power — politics, history, economy and art — constantly putting into question the idea of authority and “truth”.",El gran pacto de Chile (The Great Pact),Americas,"['museum.n.01', 'future.n.01', 'event.n.01', 'narrative.n.01', 'historical.a.01', 'history.n.01', 'medium.n.01', 'lens.n.01', 'episode.n.01', 'age.n.01', 'mass.n.01', 'represent.v.01', 'picture.v.02', 'distance.n.01', 'display.n.01', 'fragment.n.01', 'format.n.01', 'politics.n.01', 'vision.n.01', 'impact.n.01', 'interpretation.n.01', 'popular.a.01', 'corporate.s.03', 'natural.a.01', 'tradition.n.01']","['colonialism.n.01', 'politics.n.01', 'history.n.01', 'chile.n.01', 'narrative.n.01', 'fact.n.01', 'bias.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/nicolas_grum_cpax-02a_web.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/nicolas_grum_cpax-02a_web-300x199.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/gran-pacto-chile/,"['Society/6.737343358395989', 'Material_Physical/4.328973950026581', 'Politics/2.7092731829573933']","['Society', 'Material_Physical', 'Politics']",13.775590491379964,"['Land/2.6198830409356724', 'Fantasy/1.9090909090909092', 'History/1.7777777777777777']","['Land', 'Fantasy', 'History']",6.306751727804359,"['Cultural/29.27773452038159', 'Material_Physical/20.894316794316794', 'Individual_Personal/17.639072039072044']","['Cultural', 'Material_Physical', 'Individual_Personal']",67.81112335377043,"['Time/10.996148296148295', 'Media/8.518288084464555', 'Mind/8.058852258852259']","['Time', 'Media', 'Mind']",27.573288639465108,0.3333333333333333,0.0
Sue Williamson,"In her 2003 series “Better Lives”, Sue Williamson explores stories of immigrants in search of a better life in a historically contentious South Africa. In an attempt to address and confront xenophobia in South African history, Better Lives series subverts racism and prejudice by emphasizing the immigrant as human, and thus gives the subjects a voice. “Better Lives: Richard Belalufu” tells a tale of surviving in a hostile South Africa through the undercurrent reflections on violence, abuse and the difficulty of finding home as an immigrant. Referring to South African studio-photography, the Better Lives series is a demanding confrontation of the subjects whose gaze answers directly to the viewer.  Richard Belalufu is an immigrant from the Democratic Republic of Congo. He arrived in Cape Town in 1994, leaving his family behind when he heard the Mobutu regime was hunting him down, as he was playing the role of a double agent. He has a diploma in electro-mechanical engineering, and he had an important job for a big company in DRC but now works on a construction site in Cape Town. Family were finally able to join him some years later. He finds life very hard. Xenophobia is a big problem.","Sue Williamson (b. 1941, Lichfield, United Kingdom) currently based in Cape Town, occupies an influential and highly respected position in the South African art world, not only for her artistic practice but also for her long history as a writer and cultural worker. Trained as a printmaker, Williamson now includes installation, photography and video in her oeuvre. As part of the generation of South African artists who practiced in the 1970s and who addressed social change in the then apartheid South Africa, Williamson’s practice has continued to remain interested in political struggle and emancipation.  In her work, she brings the marginalized into the mainstream consciousness of society, making visible the unseen, sheaving away layers of illusion to re-present reality in a fresh light.

David Goldblatt,"David Goldblatt’s “Boksburg series” is a telling portrait of the small town that became a notorious symbol of racism in South Africa. The photographic essay negotiates the troublesome landscape of the apartheid through capturing the intimate in-between moments that are seemingly inconsequential and visually inoffensive. However, it is in this series that Goldblatt provides a candid insight into the white communities during the apartheid. “Saturday afternoon in Sunward Park, Boksburg” shows a white man mowing a lawn. Visually, the photograph is entirely uninvasive, however, the pretext to which the image speaks — the apartheid — is deeply embedded into which is unseen. Using ambiguity of narrative Goldblatt presents a suburban scene within which suffering and protest is embedded so deeply into that which can seem like nothing or nowhere. His photographs of Boksburg, an unremarkable middle-class white community of the kind that was proliferating in South Africa during the 1970s, have multiple references in the contemporary milieu: racism, capitalism, suburbanism and settlement.","Since the 1960s, David Goldblatt (b. Randfontein, South Africa, 1930) has focused his photographic practice on examining the way in which racism is manifested in the everyday white middle-class communities of South Africa. The artist’s black and white photographs are intimate portraits of South African society and landscape, often framed with a seemingly haphazard composition. The photographs are his personal observations of what it meant to be Black and White during the apartheid and a generous offering to the viewer of his visually powerful perspective. In 1989 Goldblatt founded the Market Photography Workshop in Johannesburg and in 1998 he was the first South African to be given a solo exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA), New York.","Saturday afternoon in Sunward Park, Boksburg",Middle East & Africa,"['south_africa.n.01', 'south.n.01 africa.n.01', 'africa.n.01', 'white.a.01', 'south.n.01', 'community.n.01', 'protest.n.01', 'milieu.n.01', 'town.n.01', 'multiple.a.01', 'photograph.n.01', 'symbol.n.01', 'narrative.s.01', 'series.n.01', 'everyday.s.01', 'photographic.a.01', 'moment.n.01', 'mention.n.01', 'portrayal.n.01', 'contemporary.s.01', 'scene.n.01', 'landscape.n.01']","['racism.n.01', 'apartheid.n.01', 'documentary.n.01', 'history.n.01', 'south_africa.n.01', 'white.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/50.-Goldblatt-David.-1982.-Saturday-afternoon-in-Sunward-Park-2_27762site.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/50.-Goldblatt-David.-1982.-Saturday-afternoon-in-Sunward-Park-2_27762site-300x300.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/saturday-afternoon-sunward/,"['Material_Physical/5.128973950026581', 'Politics/3.594771241830065', 'Cultural/3.3882352941176466']","['Material_Physical', 'Politics', 'Cultural']",12.111980485974293,"['Inequality/3.594771241830065', 'Land/2.6198830409356724', 'Arts/1.7411764705882353']","['Inequality', 'Land', 'Arts']",7.955830753353973,"['Material_Physical/27.243987041510266', 'Society/11.725116713352008', 'Politics/5.098529411764706']","['Material_Physical', 'Society', 'Politics']",44.06763316662698,"['Land/22.796367993891216', 'Urbanization/9.86797385620915', 'Geopolitics/2.423529411764706']","['Land', 'Urbanization', 'Geopolitics']",35.087871261865075,0.6666666666666666,0.3333333333333333
Binelde Hyrcan,"Binelde Hyrcan’s video “Cambeck” is a playful study of four boys on a beach in Angola playing in a chauffeured car made of sand. Weaved through the seemingly naïve game are themes of poverty, migration and inequality. Speaking of ‘the good life’ in the United States of America, the young boys discuss separated families as a result of migration, unemployment and education, poverty, the dream of leaving the slum for a building with walls made not of tin, and the luxury of the accessibility of transport. With the innocence of the conversation in the children’s game, the harsh realities of the developing world speak loudly. The artist’s decision to include the voice of the child speaks both to the importance of imagination in survival in the face of major social, economic and political disadvantage and to the generations of children faced with the hardship of poverty and life in a war zone. Imagination and dreaming is a method of endurance and future reparation of the trauma of social devastation. “Cambeck”, playful in its presentation and uncompromising in its delivery, is a significant insight into to the realities lived by the youth in the ongoing Angolan Civil War context.","Growing up during the Angolan Civil War, Binelde Hyrcan (b. 1983, Luanda, Angola) crosses themes of power, poverty, migration and inequality in his painting, sculptural, design, film and performative practice. The artists hard-hitting themes are delicately negotiated with humor, a seductive method of confronting the troubling realities of developing countries, and in particular Angola. The artist’s contribution to the dialogue surrounding the present refugee crisis provides an important perspective of the countries in question and the journey for a better life.",Cambeck,Middle East & Africa,"['child.n.01', 'male_child.n.01', 'imagination.n.01', 'game.n.01', 'war.n.01', 'world.n.03', 'social.a.01', 'method.n.01', 'presentation.n.01', 'ongoing.s.01', 'playful.a.01', 'injury.n.01', 'life.n.01', 'dream.n.01', 'conversation.n.01', 'coevals.n.01', 'survey.n.01', 'united_states.n.01', 'voice.n.01', 'economic.a.01', 'building.n.01', 'family.n.01', 'consequence.n.01', 'wall.n.01', 'context.n.01']","['poverty.n.01', 'inequality.n.01', 'migration.n.01', 'civil_war.n.01', 'injury.n.01', 'childhood.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Cambeck.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Cambeck-300x166.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/cambeck/,"['Politics/8.66617183985605', 'Society/8.616892911010558', 'Individual_Personal/5.918381927669853']","['Politics', 'Society', 'Individual_Personal']",23.20144667853646,"['Body/3.292008301296227', 'Inequality/2.8333333333333335', 'Geopolitics/2.725146198830409']","['Body', 'Inequality', 'Geopolitics']",8.850487833459969,"['Society/22.924964088199385', 'Cultural/22.32554406377937', 'Individual_Personal/18.67955947561211']","['Society', 'Cultural', 'Individual_Personal']",63.93006762759086,"['Spirituality/6.640476190476189', 'Culture/5.598168498168498', 'Arts/5.110897435897436']","['Spirituality', 'Culture', 'Arts']",17.349542124542122,0.6666666666666666,0.0
Rossella Biscotti,"Rossella Biscotti’s “10×10” series investigates the relationship between demographics, data processing, textile manufacturing and social structure. The work observes how demographic records have been modeled through the use of punch cards to program both early data processing machines and automated looms (jacquard). Reversing the process, Biscotti turned to the 2001–2006 census information of Brussels—where she was then based—to create a pattern on these textiles. Biscotti programed the Brussels census into an excel spreadsheet to perform a series of searches that pinpoint key demographic details. The results of each filter are noted through on the jacquard-woven textiles: single mothers, children and acquired nationalities as in particular, in this work. In this yes/no binary questions program, a yes/no answer leads to a certain line of questioning. Biscotti interrogates how statistics and quantitative analysis not only gives a misshapen representation of our society but also dictates policies (i.e., immigration quotas). In doing so, the artist underscores the codependent relationship of data processing and racial and social profiling.  By revisiting the early history and development of data processing today, the artist points at the growing economy based on new data systems—NSA monitoring, Google data mining—and its effort to measure, define, archive and control societies.","Departing from social and political history, the work of Rossella Biscotti (b. Molfetta, Italy, 1978) transforms and modifies truth through a variety of mediums: sound, film, sculpture and textile. The artist employs a documentary-styled aesthetic to highlight the impossibility to fully account for a truth told to us and heralds a heterogeneous trans-social theory that asserts multiple realities. Her work questions how objectivity is easily given to historical documents and juridical actions and considers the past as an effective vector of possible change. Biscotti’s work reflects the active role art plays in the construction of contemporary knowledge, while questioning the legitimacy of history and of those by whom it was built.",Acquired Nationalities,Europe,"['fabric.n.01', 'plan.n.01', 'society.n.01', 'relationship.n.01', 'social.a.01', 'mother.n.01', 'record.n.01', 'control.n.01', 'perform.v.01', 'machine.n.01', 'development.n.01', 'economy.n.01', 'form.n.03', 'details.n.01', 'child.n.01', 'individual.a.01', 'series.n.01', 'attempt.n.01', 'structure.n.01', 'cardinal.s.01', 'representation.n.01', 'establish.v.08', 'procedure.n.01', 'question.n.01', 'history.n.01']","['technology.n.01', 'fabric.n.01', 'industry.n.01', 'demography.n.01', 'data.n.01', 'machine.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/1.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/1-300x242.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/acquired-nationalities/,"['Cultural/22.10573558708234', 'Society/7.370149458384753', 'Material_Physical/3.1571428571428575']","['Cultural', 'Society', 'Material_Physical']",32.633027902609946,"['Technology/8.322987616099072', 'Arts/5.050879839115133', 'Economy/3.371794871794872']","['Technology', 'Arts', 'Economy']",16.745662327009075,"['Cultural/45.966230338289165', 'Society/31.494092182327485', 'Individual_Personal/29.047008547008563']","['Cultural', 'Society', 'Individual_Personal']",106.5073310676252,"['Arts/11.424542124542125', 'Economy/10.660439560439562', 'Media/9.729670329670329']","['Arts', 'Economy', 'Media']",31.81465201465201,0.6666666666666666,0.6666666666666666
Mariana Castillo Deball,"Taking archaeology as her departure point to examine the trajectories of replicated and displaced objects, “Who will measure the space, who will tell me the time?” was produced in Oaxaca for her exhibition of the same title at the Contemporary Museum of Oaxaca (MACO) in 2015. The sculpture, employing the technique of traditional Atzompa pottery originating from Oaxaca, Mexico, is an examination of the way in which archaeological heritage is remembered in the earthenware made by Atzompa potters today. Accompanied by the publication ‘Ixiptla Vol. 3’, the edition examines imposed meaning on replications in the form of the plaster molds, photographs, drawings, scale models and facsimiles made by archaeologists in the effort for conserving lost objects. The artist’s selection of shapes and forms reference her research in the permanent collection held at Rufino Tamayo Museum and is the basis for imagining a series of stories relating to Atzompa history. In that sense, the columns contain fictitious or historical figures, weaving together an intricate network in which they coincide in space and converse in time (snake, pochote and ceiba – a subtropical tree, warriors, mother earth or pottery are just a few examples). “Who will measure the space, who will tell me the time?” is a sculptural exquisite corpse, a form of an infinite column that offers a temporal space for interpretation and reflection.","The practice of Mariana Castillo Deball (b. Mexico City, 1975) is centered on intensive research. In weaving together perceived facts and legends, the artist deconstructs how we understand tradition, liberating content from imposed ideological legacies. Mariana Castillo Deball’s collaborative research—in particular in the domain of science, geology, archaeology and literature—is manifested and synthesized into her multimodal sculptural practice. The archive is a significant aspect of the artist’s practice, whereby the research conducted in the creation of her sculptures is culminated, catalogued and preserved. Deball is not only interested in traces of the past, her multidisciplinary approach allows her to study the different ways in which a historical object can be read today.","¿Quién medirá el espacio, quién me dirá el momento?, 1 (columna alfarero)",Americas,"['museum.n.01', 'space.n.01', 'form.n.01', 'time.n.01', 'remember.v.01', 'analyze.v.01', 'object.n.01', 'network.n.01', 'mexico.n.01', 'lose.v.01', 'tree.n.01', 'earth.n.01', 'sculptural.a.01', 'technique.n.01', 'model.n.01', 'interpretation.n.01', 'contemplation.n.02', 'traditional.a.01', 'produce.v.01', 'attempt.n.01', 'shape.n.01', 'historical.a.01', 'sense.n.01', 'drawing.n.01', 'figure.n.01']","['archeology.n.01', 'supplanting.n.01', 'heritage.n.01', 'facsimile.n.01', 'fiction.n.01', 'history.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/mariana_castillo_deball_kadist.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/mariana_castillo_deball_kadist-198x300.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/quien-medira-espacio/,"['Cultural/14.409834919122844', 'Society/4.833333333333334', 'Material_Physical/4.056429844665138']","['Cultural', 'Society', 'Material_Physical']",23.29959809712132,"['Fantasy/5.491666666666667', 'History/4.833333333333334', 'Geopolitics/2.5874125874125875']","['Fantasy', 'History', 'Geopolitics']",12.91241258741259,"['Cultural/15.977893451577668', 'Individual_Personal/13.205690980845784', 'Material_Physical/12.036519182571816']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Material_Physical']",41.22010361499527,"['Mind/5.8179728166570275', 'Culture/4.964835164835165', 'Time/3.4263736263736266']","['Mind', 'Culture', 'Time']",14.209181607865819,0.6666666666666666,0.0
Anne Imhof,"“School of the seven Bells (SOTSB)” is based on a series of hands games in which an object is passed from hand to hand. The performance is a reference to the film by Robert Bresson, “Pickpocket”, where a group of pickpocketers play with their victims. The artwork, through the actions of the hands, is an interrogation into space and time, questioning the relationship between public and private space, the establishment of communication through the body and visual exchange and gestures between aggression and sensuality. The drawings are an integral aspect to Imhof’s work, being made before and after the performances. In the drawings, the figurative forms fuse with the abstract elements, turning the work into a stream of unstable movements. The drawing is a means to interrogate the possibility of retaining that which is in the domain of the ephemeral, or to connect to the performative gestures (the drawings often being found in the place of performance). Some drawings are simple sketches, on the edge of abstraction, while in others Imhof uses felt and oil paint, creating a more sombre and telluric tone. The incompleteness opens the possibility for movement to come.","Anne Imhof (b. 1978, Germany) expands the canonical conception of performance to consider documentation and transmission. Imhof’s approach to the visibility of performance negotiates different designs for time and space through installation and video. Her performances can thus be considered as “re-enactments”, as they are replayed in different contexts with variations to the installation. As part of her practice, Imhof often includes her friends and peers in a series of ongoing rehersals to expand and experiment with extra-linguistic forms of communication. In examining and studying movements and gestures, often performed over several hours in silence, Imhof produces a sophisticated vocabulary of contemporary performance art.",Drawing for SOTSB II,Europe,"['drawing.n.01', 'hands.n.01', 'performance.n.01', 'possibility.n.01', 'gesture.n.01', 'hand.n.01', 'motion.n.03', 'oil.n.01', 'ephemeral.s.01', 'edge.n.01', 'private.a.01', 'tone.n.01', 'school.n.01', 'exchange.n.01', 'abstraction.n.01', 'space.n.01', 'aspect.n.01', 'paint.n.01', 'game.n.01', 'abstract.a.01', 'simple.a.01', 'artwork.n.01', 'elements.n.01', 'action.n.01', 'public.a.01']","['space.n.01', 'body.n.01', 'sensuality.n.01', 'motion.n.03', 'abstraction.n.02', 'closeness.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/ai003d_forsotsbii.jpeg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/ai003d_forsotsbii-232x300.jpeg,https://kadist.org/work/drawing-for-sotsb/,"['Material_Physical/11.262393162393163', 'Individual_Personal/7.052747252747252', 'Politics/5.672179596476272']","['Material_Physical', 'Individual_Personal', 'Politics']",23.98732001161669,"['Space/7.235042735042734', 'Emotion/4.252747252747253', 'Geopolitics/3.2026143790849675']","['Space', 'Emotion', 'Geopolitics']",14.690404366874954,"['Politics/23.473107920631147', 'Individual_Personal/20.741206995618768', 'Society/19.483217092505026']","['Politics', 'Individual_Personal', 'Society']",63.69753200875495,"['Geopolitics/8.108169934640523', 'Spirituality/7.2263736263736265', 'Arts/6.135464535464536']","['Geopolitics', 'Spirituality', 'Arts']",21.470008096478686,0.6666666666666666,0.3333333333333333
Cheikh Ndiaye,"Adjamé, Charbon reflects on both global environmental discourses and domestic impacts of the use and trade of coal. Adjamé is one of ten urban communes of the city of Abidjan, the economic capital and city with the largest French-speaking populous in the Côte d’Ivoire.

Jessica Warboys,"The ongoing “Sea Paintings” series is central to the practice of Jessica Warboys. The series plays with the notion of ritual, performance, nature and consequence. The artist realises her “Sea Paintings” on the Zennor coast, near St Ives, where she emerges the canvas in the seawater, allowing the waves and the wind to mix the raw mineral pigments that have been applied by hand to damp folded canvases. Finally the artist drags the canvases across the sand, leaving a trace of the movement of the artist in the canvas. The combination of the raw mixed pigments with the wind and the waves produces vivid final pieces. They are the result of a long process of walking, her relationship with the landscape and her practice of painting as a poetic performance. The result is a series sumptuous floor to ceiling colour canvases that revise the Western tradition of landscape painting.","Employing a variety of media including film, sculpture, ceramic, photography, found objects and sea paintings, Jessica Warboys (b. 1977, Wales) concerns her practice with historical, mythical and fictional collective memories. At the foundation of her analysis of collective memories, the artist builds a new universe in which the viewer can reconsider the past and constructed knowledge. While her works present a performative aspect, the artist does not consider herself a performing artist. Rather, she is interested in the tension at the junction and transition between ritual, performance and the artistic process.","Sea Painting, Dunwich, September",Europe,"['wave.n.01', 'sea.n.01', 'consequence.n.01', 'performance.n.01', 'practice.n.01', 'landscape.n.01', 'series.n.01', 'ongoing.s.01', 'combination.n.01', 'western.a.01', 'concluding.s.01', 'trace.n.01', 'floor.n.01', 'poetic.a.01', 'tradition.n.01', 'hand.n.01', 'cardinal.s.01', 'impression.n.01', 'relationship.n.01', 'nature.n.01', 'motion.n.03', 'procedure.n.01', 'piece.n.01']","['ritual.n.01', 'nature.n.03', 'performance.n.02', 'motion.n.03', 'landscape.n.01', 'custom.n.02']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/ggds-warboys-r_nov2013-10.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/ggds-warboys-r_nov2013-10-300x300.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/sea-painting/,"['Society/8.637254901960784', 'Material_Physical/7.904273504273505', 'Politics/6.349622926093514']","['Society', 'Material_Physical', 'Politics']",22.8911513323278,"['Geopolitics/3.9718451483157367', 'History/3.6568627450980395', 'Space/2.6153846153846154']","['Geopolitics', 'History', 'Space']",10.244092508798392,"['Individual_Personal/27.890842490842502', 'Cultural/26.143218056453357', 'Society/20.849159663865553']","['Individual_Personal', 'Cultural', 'Society']",74.88322021116142,"['Culture/9.899542124542126', 'Spirituality/8.052747252747254', 'Values/7.364835164835165']","['Culture', 'Spirituality', 'Values']",25.317124542124546,0.3333333333333333,0.0
Ian Breakwell,"“BC/AD” (Before Cancer, After Diagnoses) is a video of photographs of the artist’s face dating from early childhood to the month before he died, accompanied by the last diary entries he wrote from April 2004 to July 2005 (entitled “50 Reasons for Getting Out of Bed”), from the period from when he lost his voice, thinking he had laryngitis, through the moment he was diagnosed with lung cancer and the subsequent treatment that was ultimately, ineffective. The diary entries are at once poignant, ironic, laced with gallows of humor, with his continued eye for the little incidents in life, interweaving the past with his experience of the present. The morphing of the portraits—the eyes and sight remaining leveled—is haunting, beginning with very blurry images of childhood and ending with a pin-sharp photograph of Breakwell the month before he died. As the tumor grows so does Breakwell’s introspection, as he meditates the horizon of his life, the randomness of fate and the meaning of time to someone in his condition. The quality of Breakwell’s voice changes throughout the course of the audio recording as he struggles to project, while the sound of his inhaling breath indicates a great difficulty of breathing. It was recorded in one take: 1 hour and 55 minutes. The illness thus manifests throughout the soundtrack. In confronting his mortality, “BC/AD” is a poignant work, at once poetic and mundane. It is an act of defiance that encapsulates many aspects of Breakwell’s approach to making art.","Ian Breakwell (1943 – 2005, Derby, United Kingdom) was a leading British conceptual artist active in the dematerializing of the hierarchy of Modernity in the 1960s. Initially influenced by Surrealism, Breakwell was best known for his observation of what he called ‘little epiphanies’ he observed around him and that he recorded in his diaries from the late 1960’s, which he exhibited as art works. Until 1980, the diaries often took on a visual format but from the 1980s onwards they took a mostly verbal format. One of the most celebrated of the diaries is the Walking Man Diary (1979) where Breakwell photographed a man who walked past his studio everyday on a circuitous, continuous route with no purpose. Alongside the photographs he recorded imagined conversations of people observing him. The photographs were arranged in a grid and presented as a diary.  Combining painting, drawing, printmaking, photography, film, collage, video, audio-tape, slide, digital imaging and performance, Breakwell’s work significantly contributed considering art as documentation of a moment, rather than a marketable fine art piece.",BC/AD,Europe,"['voice.n.01', 'eye.n.01', 'life.n.01', 'photograph.n.01', 'eyes.n.01', 'aspect.n.01', 'poetic.a.01', 'approach.n.01', 'quality.n.01', 'time_period.n.01', 'sound.n.01', 'moment.n.01', 'meaning.n.01', 'experience.n.01', 'time.n.01', 'video.n.01', 'image.n.01']","['death.n.01', 'mortality.n.01', 'decay.n.01', 'ripening.n.02', 'life.n.01', 'illness.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/argib0226_bc-ad_2005_-_2008_digital_video_bw_sound_59mins36sec_ed_of_5_still_18_2.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/argib0226_bc-ad_2005_-_2008_digital_video_bw_sound_59mins36sec_ed_of_5_still_18_2-300x240.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/bc-ad/,"['Material_Physical/4.985347985347985', 'Individual_Personal/3.5087719298245617', 'Society/2.611965811965812']","['Material_Physical', 'Individual_Personal', 'Society']",11.106085727138359,"['Body/2.675438596491228', 'Materiality/2.435897435897436', 'Time/1.7802197802197801']","['Body', 'Materiality', 'Time']",6.891555812608444,"['Individual_Personal/20.43363303363304', 'Cultural/13.936813659336885', 'Material_Physical/10.884604284604285']","['Individual_Personal', 'Cultural', 'Material_Physical']",45.25505097757421,"['Materiality/5.781929181929182', 'Mind/5.534065934065934', 'Culture/4.76923076923077']","['Materiality', 'Mind', 'Culture']",16.085225885225885,0.6666666666666666,0.3333333333333333
Randa Maddah,"Shot from the rooftop of her house in Majdal Shams, through a complex construction of moving mirrors, this video connects both sides of the border which has cut through Syrian Golan heights since the 1967 Six-Day war. Located on the cease-fire line, residents of Majdal Shams are reminded of this tragic separation on a daily basis. During the war the majority of the local population were exiled to Syria. Through the configuration of the mirrors, the Israeli and Syrian military infrastructures which enforce the separation, are placed in the same line of sight, just as the population on both sides of the border are subject to the same oppression. They share an equal sense of lost identity and erased memory. For the artist, the work represents a fragmented vision of her fragmented self, set against a beautiful landscape that she feels her own.","Randa Maddah, was born 1983 in Majdal Shams, occupied Syrian Golan. Her practice is often rooted in the notion of homeland, working closely around the subject of Madjal Shams and the inextricable ties to war, homeland, borders and exile. With formal training in sculpture and etching, Maddah’s work frequently takes the form of realistic depictions of bodies and landscapes, warped by weight of experience, the faces and forms of which are mirrored in her pencil drawings.

,"The series Nightmare Wallpapers represents a shift if Chuen’s practice, allowing the artist to immerse himself in an “artistic pilgrimage of self healing” following the failure of the 2014 Umbrella Movement. These drawings were created during the trial of political activists pursued by the government that the artist would regularly attend. During the tribunal, the artist would let his pen slide freely across his notebook, replicating the automatic drawing techniques of the surrealists. He then scans these random traces, blowing them up on the computer, multiplying each fragment, giving way to decorative abstract motifs reminiscent of wallpaper. Through this process Chuen analyzes the details of these unconscious productions, allowing him to begin a psychological healing process, leading him to reconnect with his environment. Furthermore, these drawings, born from the public gallery of a courtroom, speak of the relationship between the State and the individual. Following their creation, works from this series, Street, Court and Prison entered into the public domain, accompanying newspaper articles, and entering the sphere of collective memory.",,Nightmare-Wallpaper (No.DCCC901-16#8): An-Angel-in-Conversation-with-a-Young-Lady,Asia,"['drawing.n.01', 'public.a.01', 'procedure.n.01', 'newspaper.n.01', 'prison.n.01', 'psychological.s.01', 'militant.n.01', 'bear.v.01', 'shift.n.01', 'fragment.n.01', 'creation.n.01', 'trace.n.01', 'details.n.01', 'technique.n.01', 'production.n.01', 'corporate.s.03', 'abstract.a.01', 'government.n.01', 'series.n.01', 'person.n.01', 'environment.n.01', 'street.n.01', 'relationship.n.01', 'memory.n.01', 'motion.n.03']","['protest.n.01', 'activism.n.01', 'mend.v.02', 'abstraction.n.02', 'surrealism.n.01', 'government.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/MissingGirl-GZ181025-Pf-A3.png,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/MissingGirl-GZ181025-Pf-A3-214x300.png,https://kadist.org/work/nightmare-wallpaper-no-dccc901-168-an-angel-in-conversation-with-a-young-lady/,"['Politics/5.5445652173913045', 'Cultural/1.577777777777778', 'Material_Physical/0.7777777777777778']","['Politics', 'Cultural', 'Material_Physical']",7.9001207729468605,"['Activism/2.875', 'Politics/1.8695652173913042', 'Language/0.8']","['Activism', 'Politics', 'Language']",5.5445652173913045,"['Cultural/35.67309024824505', 'Politics/23.46826833297422', 'Society/22.511929900165203']","['Cultural', 'Politics', 'Society']",81.65328848138448,"['Arts/10.237484737484738', 'Media/9.477491239410744', 'Spirituality/7.283516483516484']","['Arts', 'Media', 'Spirituality']",26.998492460411967,0.6666666666666666,0.0
Bady Dalloul,"The Great Game is a series of works composed of a number of card combinations illustrated by the faces of key political figures shaping the geopolitical landscape in the Middle East. Each reconstituted ‘hand of play’ corresponds to a diplomatic treaty establishing or modifying geographical borders. The plastic form of a poker hand chosen by the artist highlights the randomness of the process of fixing boundaries and the way in which they do not account for the lives of those located there. These eleven works cover two major themes of Dalloul’s artistic practice, play and power relations in geopolitics.  In this combination, Dalloul focuses on the Balfour Declaration featuring images of David Lloyd George, The Viscount Milner, Baron Rothschild, Arthur James Balfour and Leo Amery. Signed in 1917 by Arthur Balfour, former British Foreign Secretary, this open letter is addressed to Lord Lionel Walter Rothschild, eminence of the British Jewish community and is proof of the promise made on behalf of the British government by Lord Balfour to recognize a Jewish national home in Palestine. This promise marked the history of the Middle East forever; the state of Israel was created in 1948 as a result of this British commitment.","The oeuvre of Bady Dalloul currently based in Paris, sophisticatedly and cunningly employs collage across various media: texts, drawings, video, and objects to produce powerful works commenting on the past and the present. His collages imply a construction, the fabrication of a space that is simultaneously autobiographical, critical, poetic and narrative. Thus, he makes narratives where the real and fiction, and individual and collective experiences, enter into a permanent dialogue questioning the official historical grand narratives. The artist conceived of a fragile book, tattered by time and long use. It’s a diary, and he has patiently filled every page. He has taken notes ever since his childhood spent in Paris and Damascus, cutting out and pasting in illustrations from history magazines and books to make up stories like Badland (1999–2004). His practice began as a way to keep busy and counter boredom and the incomprehensibility of the crisis that has held Syria in its grip for decades.

These agreements were challenged five years later by Iraq when the two countries entered the Iran-Iraq War (1980-1988).

This work represents the correspondence between Colonel Sir Henry McMahon, British High Commissioner in Egypt and Hussein bin Ali al-Hashimi, Arab leader, Emir of Mecca, during the First World War and at the beginning of the Arab revolt against the Ottoman Empire in 1916. These letter exchanges have had a decisive impact on Middle Eastern history as they mark the official promise by the British government of an independent Arab state. A state that will never see the light of day and will be superseded by the Sykes-Picot Agreements, which will divide the Middle East into two zones of influence through the establishment of administrative mandates; implicating the British in Palestine, Jordan and southern Iraq, and the French in present-day Syria and Lebanon. The formation of these contemporary states is the direct consequence of the failings of this correspondence.

David G. Tretiakoff,"Immolation I is taken from the four-part Immolation series which shows four Arab revolutionaries who publicly sacrificed themselves through self-immolation and in so doing heralded the beginning of the Arab Spring. The lugubrious drawings are made with cigarette burns, a direct reference to torture and burning stakes, even if what is depicted here can be considered the ultimate act of resistance in the form of self-destruction.  The portraits were meticulously executed on large-scale fragile sheets of paper. They present horribly detailed images imbued with paradoxical power. The burning male figures — Mohamed Bouazizi from Tunisia, Ahmad Hachem as-Sayyed from Egypt, Ahmad al-Matarneh from Jordan and Hamza Al-Khatib from Syria — surrounded by flames, seem to be consumed by an incessant torture; the burn holes through the paper show a trajectory of scars. Here, Tretiakoff presents the disconnection between political religiosity and resistance.  The immolations are part of a broader body of work consisting of drawings graphics, photographs and burnt paper, revisiting The Red Line Agreement. Tretiakoff goes back to the secret meeting in the Royal Palace Hotel in Ostend, Belgium in 1928 when 3 men decided they would divide up the world between them. Merging the 3 biggest oil companies at the time, they sealed the fate of the world for a long time to come. Mirroring them to revolutionaries of the Arab world, Tretiakoff creates a chilling dispositive, wherein the geopolitical touches the intimate, with an eerie proximity of the body.","The work of French filmmaker David Gheron Tretiakoff often revolves around the socio-political movements of the Middle East. Seeking to avoid a journalistic didacticism, he instead looks to reveal the psycho-social impact of national oppression, international terrorism and the reverberations of history. His work intentionally leaves the viewer feeling uneasy as he exposes the inherent contradictions of habituation and resistance that inhabit such situations.   One of his seminal works, A God Passing (2007) documents the statue of Ramses travelling from Cairo to a new museum on the Giza Plateau shortly before the Arab Spring. As crowds of people flood the street and the scene descends into chaos, we retrospectively realize that we are baring witness to one of the first moments of the people taking stock of their own power, as the authorities stand by helpless and we’re left wondering, did Ramses catalyze the Arab Spring?",Immolation I,Europe,"['paper.n.01', 'resistance.n.01', 'drawing.n.01', 'body.n.01', 'oil.n.01', 'company.n.01', 'sheet.n.01', 'direct.a.01', 'picture.v.02', 'time.n.01', 'see.v.05', 'artwork.n.01', 'mention.n.01', 'portrayal.n.01', 'power.n.01', 'figure.n.01', 'political.a.01', 'form.n.01', 'photograph.n.01', 'series.n.01', 'image.n.01']","['forfeit.n.03', 'revolution.n.01', 'protest.n.01', 'despair.n.01', 'destruction.n.01', 'resistance.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Immolation-I-220x75.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Immolation-I-220x75-105x300.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/immolation-i/,"['Politics/15.636538461538464', 'Society/12.051164777251737', 'Material_Physical/8.202283990519284']","['Politics', 'Society', 'Material_Physical']",35.88998722930948,"['Power/8.146153846153846', 'Activism/5.1826923076923075', 'Environmental/4.06007326007326']","['Power', 'Activism', 'Environmental']",17.388919413919414,"['Material_Physical/15.308791208791215', 'Cultural/13.272175373645965', 'Individual_Personal/10.771184371184372']","['Material_Physical', 'Cultural', 'Individual_Personal']",39.352150953621546,"['Space/7.203296703296703', 'Arts/4.353321678321678', 'Power/3.511655011655012']","['Space', 'Arts', 'Power']",15.068273393273394,0.3333333333333333,0.3333333333333333
Christine Rebet,"In the Soldier’s Head evokes the traumas of war through the prism of the hallucinations of a soldier. Inspired by the artist’s father,a soldier in Algeria who then suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder,the video depicts the delusions flowing from a mind ravaged by violence: a vision grown from the inside out. Like a mirage amidst a blank, desert expanse, specters are conjured as the inanimate comes to life. Whirring machines sputter, gears turn and levers crank as ceaselessly firing synapses of a hyperactive psyche pour out. The helmet, like the soldier’s head itself, becomes a crucible for burning delusions fed by the violated land: no more than a vessel for wildly-flowing cerebrospinal fluid impulses. Rebet’s inks literally dance on page and screen, morphing as liquid-fueled illusions, only to wash away, as an oasis vanishes.","Taking formal cues from the optical illusions and landscapes drawn in pre-cinematic entertainment, French artist Christine Rebet seeks to unveil the way these kinds of devices are mirrored in contemporary politics and media. Her work is anchored in drawing, but extends to installation, performance and animation, through which she addresses issues of historical trauma through personal reinterpretation; a colorful, liquid style unraveling troubling apparitions.",In the Soldier’s Head,Europe,"['soldier.n.01', 'mind.n.01', 'head.n.01', 'ghost.n.01', 'illusion.n.01', 'father.n.01', 'injury.n.01', 'machine.n.01', 'land.n.01', 'vision.n.01', 'screen.n.01', 'inspire.v.01', 'violence.n.01', 'war.n.01', 'life.n.01', 'video.n.01']","['war.n.01', 'posttraumatic_stress_disorder.n.01', 'injury.n.01', 'violence.n.01', 'tension.n.01', 'anxiety.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/CR.2015.V.2211.InTheSolidersHead.Still_05.png,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/CR.2015.V.2211.InTheSolidersHead.Still_05-300x231.png,https://kadist.org/work/in-the-soldiers-head/,"['Society/10.016079508726566', 'Politics/5.667050596462361', 'Individual_Personal/4.268478889531521']","['Society', 'Politics', 'Individual_Personal']",19.95160899472045,"['Violence/6.496848739495799', 'Power/3.107692307692308', 'War/2.75']","['Violence', 'Power', 'War']",12.354541047188107,"['Individual_Personal/13.407606428659063', 'Society/11.705542986425339', 'Cultural/11.29614486820369']","['Individual_Personal', 'Society', 'Cultural']",36.40929428328809,"['Mind/5.486868686868688', 'Violence/4.639705882352941', 'Technology/4.580882352941177']","['Mind', 'Violence', 'Technology']",14.707456922162805,0.6666666666666666,0.3333333333333333
Jean Claracq,"View From an Apartment features 18-year-old Joland Novaj whose image was taken from Instagram. Staring vacantly at his cereal bowl, his computer is open on his own Instagram account and Steinbeck’s “Grapes of Wrath” lies open next to it, illustrated with a XV century illumination. Beyond the room there is a bay, lined with modernist buildings. This detailed urban landscape that surrounds Novai is likely to be familiar to both audience and spectator, a nod to Manet’s Un Bar aux Folies Bergères, or Jeff Wall’s View from an Apartment with which Claracq’s piece shares a title. This work is exemplary of Jean Claracq’s practice; before making the work, he knew exactly, intuitively, what type of character he was looking for in his protagonist, while the painting in its totality is the result of the composition of about 70 different references from social media, films, books, art history, and the artist’s own personal life.","Jean Claracq uses his work to deal with issues of loneliness in the social media era, depicting scenes of everyday life featuring isolated individuals against broad infrastructures as an evocation of alienation. His subjects are pulled from social network accounts and portrayed motionless in front of a digital device. These individuals are often straddling the departure from adolescence and entering adulthood, filled with both melancholy and an openness to the future that awaits them. Architecture and its mathematical, atmospheric, and photographic qualities also play a central role in his work. Inspired by Gerhard Richter, he explores the relationship between painting and digital art, using colors and textures that disassociate from photo paper or screen brightness.  His realistic, neat compositions are painted with oil onto wood. They are born from a meticulous process that mixes found images from the Internet and historical references. He enjoys playing with layers of interpretation, incorporating hundreds of references, allowing him to represent an accumulation of perspectives through fragmented images that give way to an imagined reality, aesthetically reminiscent of video games.",View from an apartment,Europe,"['apartment.n.01', 'position.n.03', 'type.n.01', 'supporter.n.01', 'familiar.a.01', 'audience.n.01', 'century.n.01', 'book.n.01', 'urban.a.01', 'personal.a.01', 'building.n.01', 'composition.n.01', 'consequence.n.01', 'mention.n.01', 'fictional_character.n.01', 'wall.n.01', 'medium.n.01', 'practice.n.01', 'title.n.01', 'spectator.n.01', 'landscape.n.01', 'piece.n.01', 'social.a.01', 'history.n.01', 'movie.n.01']","['engineering.n.02', 'melancholia.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/19.PA_.EU_.1.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/19.PA_.EU_.1-300x224.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/view-from-an-apartment/,"['Cultural/12.605392156862745', 'Individual_Personal/4.158169934640522', 'Society/1.6235294117647059']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Society']",18.387091503267975,"['Arts/4.906862745098039', 'Technology/4.541666666666666', 'Language/2.3790849673202614']","['Arts', 'Technology', 'Language']",11.827614379084967,"['Cultural/41.19505914659366', 'Society/27.005117431588022', 'Individual_Personal/13.679934281404874']","['Cultural', 'Society', 'Individual_Personal']",81.88011085958655,"['Media/13.433123249299722', 'Arts/11.105525030525031', 'History/6.898809523809524']","['Media', 'Arts', 'History']",31.43745780363428,1.0,0.3333333333333333
Urban Fauna Lab,"Misting Miner is a vapor sculpture by Alexey Buldakov from the Urban Fauna Lab collective that gives material form to the invisible phenomenon of mining cryptocurrency. The work is comprised of a water cooling system attached to technology that continuously mines cryptocurrency, and in the process also generates an extraordinary amount of heat. As a latent and untapped source of energy, the artist harnesses the heat and reveals its transformative potential by turning it into fog through the water cooling system, which he then reroutes to follow a cycle of evaporation, condensation, and precipitation. Unlike banks and other financial institutions, digital currencies such as Ethereum — the type used by the Miner — rely on encryption techniques to generate ‘coins,’ which are then bought and sold. For Buldakov, these new systems of generating value exist much like a virus, replicating their genetic codes by hashing long mathematical equations which populate servers producing more and more excess heat around the world. As bitcoin ATMs slowly roll out across San Francisco, the Misting Miner reveals the unseen impact of online economies and cyber-punk utopias through the alchemical process of mining digital gold.","Urban Fauna Lab is a collective founded by Russian artists Alexey Buldakov and Anastasia Potemkina in 2011. Conceived of as an long-term research project, several of their initiatives have studied the relationships—parasitic, symbiotic, mutual adaptation—between the thousands of species that populate urban environments around us. Whether focusing on crows, sparrows, pigeons, rats or stray cats, the collective explores the negotiations between biological systems and the social, cultural and ontological relationships they have to our own history. Described by the artists as ““the experimental space of new biopolitical utopia,” their research addresses the ecological impact we have as species as well as the instability of the parasitic urban fauna that has somehow adapted to exist between nature and the built world.",Misting Miner,Europe,"['water.n.01', 'digital.a.01', 'procedure.n.01', 'san_francisco.n.01', 'phenomenon.n.01', 'type.n.01', 'invisible.a.01', 'institution.n.01', 'economy.n.01', 'technology.n.01', 'impact.n.01', 'technique.n.01', 'beginning.n.04', 'sculpture.n.01', 'form.n.01']","['currency.n.01', 'heat.n.01', 'encoding.n.01', 'energy.n.01', 'virus.n.01', 'ecology.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Urban-Fauna-Lab_Misting-MInerWEB-copy.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Urban-Fauna-Lab_Misting-MInerWEB-copy-249x300.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/misting-miner/,"['Material_Physical/6.604151404151404', 'Society/0.8571428571428571', 'Individual_Personal/0.8571428571428571']","['Material_Physical', 'Society', 'Individual_Personal']",8.318437118437117,"['Physics/2.4571428571428573', 'Environmental/1.8', 'Familial/0.8571428571428571']","['Physics', 'Environmental', 'Familial']",5.114285714285714,"['Cultural/18.259654561125156', 'Society/14.184968832337258', 'Individual_Personal/9.100208288443582']","['Cultural', 'Society', 'Individual_Personal']",41.544831681906,"['Arts/7.455392156862745', 'Spirituality/5.103296703296704', 'Economy/4.259706959706961']","['Arts', 'Spirituality', 'Economy']",16.81839581986641,0.6666666666666666,0.0
Roni Mocan,"Roni Mocan’s work Welcome is a floorwork comprised of a grid-like arrangement of doormats that the artist borrowed from the local community, people in his building, and even from participating artists from the exhibition where it was first presented. In a time where xenophobia, divisive border rhetorics and news of an ongoing global refugee crisis have become commonplace, instead of sitting barely noticed at a home’s entrance, Mocan transforms these ubiquitous objects into carriers of a poignant and necessary greeting message. The installation underscores issues of migration, borders and racism, and gives light to the urgent need and responsibility we have towards addressing the issues that prevent humans from being welcome everywhere.","Roni Mocan ‘s works are inspired by common events of daily life. Taking cues from the world around him  — as the artist states: “from something as apparently banal as eating, getting dressed, taking the subway, or even a politician’s speech” — Mocan utilizes the cotidian to address a rage of themes such as identity, place, migration, and consumerism among others. He often recontextualizes simple, found objects and materials from the everyday, finding in them latent evidence that speak of complexities in our lives.

Martin Creed,"This photograph of Martin Creed himself was used as the invitation card for a fundraising auction of works on paper at Christie’s South Kensington in support of Camden Arts Centre’s first year in a refurbished building in 2005. His broad smile, on the verge of laughter, encourages reciprocity on behalf of the onlooker. This could be said to be a typical tactic in Creed’s work as it is so infused with humor and irony. To him, art is like a game, or certainly very much a part of banal reality. Within the genre of self-portraits, this subverts the usual tradition of images of the artist as creator. Creed often jokes or questions whether the artwork (or in this case the persona of the artist) has any value or exists. Standing in front of a very British brick wall which likely carries art historical connections and puns, Creed seems to mock or certainly stand amazed at his own commercial success. In 2001, he won the Turner Prize with his controversial Work No. 227. The Lights Going on and off.  “I want to make things. I’m not sure why, but I think it’s got something to do with other people. I think I want to try to communicate with other people, because I want to say ‘hullo’, because I want to express myself, and because I want to be loved”.","Martin Creed is a sculptor, filmmaker, performer and installation artist. Working within a minimal or conceptual mode, most of his artworks, objects, statements, suggestions or performances are titled “Work” and numbered. He wittily subverts the definitions of art and often uses mundane modest materials such as Blu-Tack, balloons, tape, piles of paper. In 1993, Work No. 81 consisted of a one-inch cube of masking tape in the middle of every wall in a London firm and since 1998 Work No. 200 proposes “the air in a given space” through filling it with balloons. Yet any anti-materialism is occasionally counteracted like in the marble staircase realized for the city of Edinburgh or the bronze sculptures. Creed is constantly reappraising things and nothings and all incumbent relations.

Marcelo Cidade,"Marcelo Cidade interrogates the city, architecture and urban planning. This architectonic drawing proposes modular possibilities, adaptable variations based on the form of the concrete block (a material which is often actually integrated in his practice). The “re-definition” announced in the title is in construction, in process, under development, in flux. The investigation appears incomplete, but potentially infinite, therefore full of potential.  This work is like a claim for the competence of artists to contribute to new visions for society, like a hymn to their capacity for imagination within a larger debate. Cidade offers abstract viewpoints on real societal questions to do with housing and propriety development while pointing to an urgent need for revisiting Brazilian history of Modernist architecture and Neoconcretism.","Marcelo Cidade is an artist of situations, if not a Situationist of a new age, as he drifts through city streets around the world creating actions, interventions, films, photographs or drawings.

Carlos Amorales,"Produced on the occasion of an exhibition at ARTIUM of Alava, Basque Centre-Museum of Contemporary Art, this deck of cards is a selection of images from Carlos Amorales’s Liquid Archive. and abstract silhouetted motifs, in a black and white palette, are combined to create a world lodged between fantasy and reality typical of the tarot game. Airplanes, letters, naked women, Osama Bin Laden, Che Guevara, mythological figures, skulls, wrestlers’ masks are some of the visuals that populate this printed object. It was distributed to fortune-tellers for their interpretation of the future. It is also presented framed and hung in a grid or as an artist’s book. Jennifer Allen writes in artforum (Summer 2005): “Surfaces can serve blindness and vision: images, decoration and destiny. While linking clairvoyants, psychologists, and art critics as interpreters, Amorales also levels the hierarchy between artists, whose creations are generally treated as singular, and actors and musicians, who often interpret works that have already been produced or performed by others. In the era of postproduction – where images tend to be ready-made – the artist is simply a point of distribution, not the origin of images.”  An edition exists in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art, New York.","Carlos Amorales, based in Mexico City, works in many media and combinations thereof, including video, drawing, painting, photography, installation, animation, and performance. Central in his work is the construction and alteration of what he calls his Liquid Archive, a collection of images, narratives, drawings, shapes, and ideas that he uses to construct his unique visual language—a critical and stimulating space for fantasy, reality, and the blurring of the two.

Allora & Calzadilla,"This installation combines the display of real objects with the deceptively painterly  amalgamation of their content as the subject of a photograph. Here Allora & Calzadilla condemn the worldwide threat of violence caused by the high desirability of oil and water. Caught in the light, the patterning of the two liquids in the print creates attractive rainbow-like pools, a distanced comment on pollution. This trace on the ground is an aestheticized piece of evidence of a real heavily loaded problem for nature and society. The artist’s critical stance is poetically and precisely rendered to encourage debate about politics, power and ecology through art.  Pure, life-enhancing natural resources are presented as potentially explosive substances in metal or plastic containers. Such absurdity is made visible in the direct dialogue of cause and effect in this presentation which is then amplified by the title, The Nature of Conflict, which adds to the imagination of extended dangerousness.

Allora & Calzadilla,"This series of photographs is part of the body of work Allora & Calzadilla made regarding the situation in Vieques, an island off the mainland of Puerto Rico used for the 60 years by the U.S Military and NATO forces to practice military bombing exercises. In 2000, they began a collaboration with the local activists to make the campaign more visible. Having added cast rubber reliefs of their slogans and designs to the soles of their shoes, the activists stamped their protest on the reclaimed land. By slightly manipulating everyday objects to become communication tools, Allora & Calzadilla had created “mobile print-making machines” (Yates McKee, October 133, Summer 2010). They then photographed the ephemeral aftermath of these mark-making actions.  Like graffitied walls, the details of these impressions on sandy grounds are landscapes of dissent, willing the transition of propriety back to the inhabitants. In Land Mark #10, numerous footsteps with long statements stamp their resentment in different confused orientations. Such a beach scene might at first misleadingly be associated with a playful holiday snap. The fragility, uncertainty and relentlessness of this struggle is poetically summarized in this close-up of meaningful site-specific expression. The artists wrote: “How is land differentiated from other land by the way it is marked? Who decides what is worth preserving and what should be destroyed? What are the strategies for reclaiming marked land? How does one articulate an ethics and politics of land use?” (in Land Mark, de Tokyo, Paris, 2006).","Jennifer Allora and Guillermo Calzadilla comprise the artistic duo Allora & Calzadilla.

Tarek Atoui,"For The Reverse Sessions, the artist reversed the order in which instruments are usually created, taking the sounds of a collection of ethnic musical instruments from The Dahlem Museum as the starting point. The artist used the audio recordings of live performances that he wrote and directed, to collaborate with instrument makers on imagining and building the objects that could have generated these recordings. Without involving any images, Atoui proposed to engage with sound directly — contrary to the path of ethnomusicology that studies the shape and mechanism of an instrument with an emphasis on its cultural and social context. The Reverse Sessions is the result of this collaboration: eight original instruments that combine string, wind and percussion, which were activated during performances and rehearsals that took place over the duration of Atoui’s five-week exhibition at Kurimanzutto gallery.","Tarek Atoui is an artist and electroacoustic composer working with sound performance. The artist engineers complex and inventive instruments as well as arranges and curates interventions, concerts, performances, and workshops. His practice develops from extensive research into music history and instrumentation, revolving around large-scale, collaborative performances that explore new methods of production. The artist’s work is centrally concerned with the ongoing reflection on the instrument and the act of performing as a multifaceted, open, and dynamic process.

Cyprien Tokoudagba,"In a style that is unique of Tokoudagba, he evokes the kings, gods and their symbols related to the earth, water, air and fire, usually on a white background. The representations of voodoo divinities imagined by the artist often return to the same pattern of red and black circles, participating in the mysterious character of the work. The title can enlighten the interpretation of these symbols: in voodoo, the guede are the spirits of death and fertility.","Cyprien Tokoudagba self-taught drawing and cement sculpture before being noticed for his decorating skills. Immersed in voodoo (vodun) and the deity of water Tôhôssou, he was sought after by voodoo priests to adorn temples in Benin, Togo, Ghana and Nigeria. In 1987, he was named as the conservator of the Museum of Abomey. He was quickly discovered by André Magnin and then by the European public after exhibiting in “Les Magiciens de la Terre” en 1989 at the Centre Georges Pompidou, and eventually developed his practice into and painting on canvas to enter the art market. He then exhibited at the Tate (Liverpool), Hayward Gallery (London), the Mori and Tobu Museums of Art (Tokyo), and the Smithsonian (Washington, D.C.).

Hama Goro,"Hama Goro works with a traditional method called the Bogolan technique, which is inspired by a method used in Mali to color clothes. The ingredients of the various colors originate from natural products such as clay, leaves and bark. The colors had a symbolic significance and were used during ritual ceremonies. With the Dogon people, hunters exclusively use ochre-yellow; the black color was only for those taking care of the animals. The artist is mainly inspired by the tradition and the daily life of his Dogon environment, and deals with the social, economic and political situation in his country and the relation between the North and the South.","Hama Goro started his career in 1987, after studying at the National Art Institute of Bamako (INA), where he received his degree in drawing and visual arts. After several solo and group exhibitions, he was awarded a UNESCO – ASCHBERG scholarship in 1994 for professional training at the Rijksakademie Van Beeldende Kunsten in Amsterdam. He invested in research for the development of this sector, and was one of the initiators of the Centre Soleil d’Afrique in Bamako in 1999. He headed Soleil d’Afrique since its creation, turning the center into a framework to offer Malian artists a creative space. Goro is one of the founding members of KYA Network (the network of Malian cultural actors) for the promotion and development of art and culture in Mali, Arterial Network (a non-profit organization and network of artists, cultural activists, entrepreneurs, enterprises, NGOs, institutions, and donors active in Africa’s creative and cultural sectors), and Rain Network (network of artists’ initiatives from countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America, set up by former participants of the Rijksakademie van beeldende kunsten), among others.",Untitled,Middle East & Africa,"['method.n.01', 'colors.n.01', 'inspire.v.01', 'animal.n.01', 'technique.n.01', 'daily.s.01', 'relation.n.01', 'symbolic.a.01', 'south.n.01', 'economic.a.01', 'traditional.a.01', 'natural.a.01', 'situation.n.01', 'tradition.n.01', 'environment.n.01', 'color.n.01', 'state.n.04', 'black.a.01', 'people.n.01', 'political.a.01', 'social.a.01', 'life.n.01']","['ritual.n.01', 'ceremony.n.01', 'custom.n.02', 'fabric.n.01', 'symbolism.n.01', 'politics.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Hama-Gorobd_.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Hama-Gorobd_-194x300.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/untitled-4/,"['Society/9.168426344896934', 'Cultural/8.20814479638009', 'Politics/2.547008547008547']","['Society', 'Cultural', 'Politics']",19.92357968828557,"['History/4.426093514328809', 'Arts/2.5384615384615383', 'Economy/2.371794871794872']","['History', 'Arts', 'Economy']",9.33634992458522,"['Material_Physical/20.936263736263744', 'Individual_Personal/18.449811463046764', 'Politics/10.126210227680817']","['Material_Physical', 'Individual_Personal', 'Politics']",49.512285426991326,"['Land/10.93724053724054', 'Values/4.806221719457014', 'Mind/4.774358974358975']","['Land', 'Values', 'Mind']",20.51782123105653,0.3333333333333333,0.0
Papa Ibra Tall,"During the years of President Senghor, Papa Ibra Tall was influential in the cultural dimension of Senegalese politics, participating in the implementation of the Dakar School, a movement of artistic renewal born at the dawn of the country’s independence between 1960 and 1974 and which was encouraged by President Senghor. The artist set out to transcribe ‘negritude’ in his works, according to Senghor’s definition in Problème de la Négritude: “To assume the values of civilization of the Black world, to actualize them and to fertilize them, if necessary with the foreign contributions, to live by oneself and for oneself, but also to make them live by and for others, thus bringing the contribution of the new Negroes to the civilization of the universal.”","Papa Ibra Tall discovered black power militants and the American black jazz movement in Paris after studying at the Ecole Spéciale d’Architecture et les Beaux-Arts de Paris in 1955. In 1959, he organised an exhibition of Black artists then living in Europe for the Second Congress of Black Writers and Artists in Rome. In 1960, after a trip to the United States, he met Jazz musician John Coltrane and African-American minister and human rights activist Malcolm X. In 1960, the year of Independence, he returned definitively to Senegal and became head of the Section for Research in Black Plastic Arts. It was at the Sèvres School of Craft that in 1962–1963 he became familiar with ceramics, screen-printing and, above all, tapestry, in which he then excelled at the National Tapestry Manufactory, created by President Senghor in 1966. Between 1975 and 1983, he became involved in various positions at the Ministry of Culture, before becoming in 1989 General Manager of the Senegalese Manufactures of Decorative Arts. He participated in the 8th Biennial of Arts of São Paulo (1965), the First World Festival of Negro Arts in Dakar (1966), the First Pan-African Festival of Algiers (1969), the First Salon of Senegalese artists at the Museum Dynamique de Dakar (1973), and his latest monographic exhibition is “Drawings of Papa Ibra TALL” at the National Art Gallery of Dakar (1991).",La semeuse d’étoiles,Middle East & Africa,"['bear.v.01', 'school.n.01', 'dimension.n.01', 'black.n.01', 'put.v.01', 'politics.n.01', 'state.n.04', 'motion.n.03', 'cultural.a.01']","['colonialism.n.01', 'negritude.n.01', 'resistance.n.01', 'activist.s.01', 'human_right.n.01', 'culture.n.06']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Piasa-Papa-Ibra-Tallbd.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Piasa-Papa-Ibra-Tallbd-300x277.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/semeuse-detoiles/,"['Politics/9.070745044429255', 'Society/8.333094992382918', 'Cultural/3.316239316239316']","['Politics', 'Society', 'Cultural']",20.72007935305149,"['Politics/4.4523809523809526', 'Colonization/2.6527777777777777', 'Violence/2.442105263157895']","['Politics', 'Colonization', 'Violence']",9.547263993316625,"['Politics/7.626143790849673', 'Society/4.290196078431372', 'Individual_Personal/4.2']","['Politics', 'Society', 'Individual_Personal']",16.116339869281045,"['Geopolitics/3.2026143790849675', 'Community/2.688888888888889', 'Politics/2.0']","['Geopolitics', 'Community', 'Politics']",7.891503267973857,0.6666666666666666,0.3333333333333333
Diamond Stingily,"Dad is Byron is an audio work produced in collaboration between Diamond Stingily and her father, the house musician Byron Stingily. Viewers are invited to pick up a wall-mounted telephone that has been retrofitted to play a recording of a conversation between Stingily and her father.  Although initially the artist planned to focus on her father’s recollections of the violence during his childhood in Chicago in the 1960s and how music helped him cope, the conversation has a natural and intimate meandering. Prompted by his daughter’s questions, Byron Stingily ruminates on his life remembering old friends that have passed, his love for music, his relationship to certain musicians, and even breaking into song occasionally as they both chuckle. Combined with his intimate knowledge and experience of music, the work is a warm, earnest and deeply personal portrait of a man, a musician, a father, and his relationship with his daughter.","Diamond Stingily works in a wide variety of media, from spoken word, video and audio to sculpture and installation. Exploring themes of class, race and gender, her work is infused with the deeply personal, often incorporating motifs from her own childhood and references to her family. Poetry is also an important part of Stingily’s output. She began writing as an 8 year old in a diary gifted to her by her grandmother, a habit which she currently sustains in tandem and sometimes interwoven with her work as a visual artist. She also hosts an online radio broadcast, The Diamond Stingily Show, where she engages with other writers and plays recordings of them reading their work. From benign symbols of her childhood to pieces that evoke aspects of normalized violence experienced by her or her family members—like flood lights and cameras as surveillance methods deployed in certain racialized ghettos—her art and words are a meditation on belonging, family, community, and most importantly, speak of the African diaspora through her perspective as a black woman.",Dad is Byron,Americas,"['father.n.01', 'music.n.01', 'conversation.n.01', 'relationship.n.01', 'love.n.01', 'telephone.n.01', 'cognition.n.01', 'collaboration.n.01', 'viewing_audience.n.01', 'produce.v.01', 'house.n.01', 'natural.a.01', 'violence.n.01', 'personal.a.01', 'portrayal.n.01', 'experience.n.01', 'question.n.01', 'life.n.01']","['fatherhood.n.01', 'music.n.01', 'family.n.01', 'conversation.n.01', 'intimate.s.01', 'memory.n.03']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/IMG_Dad-is-Byron_WEB.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/IMG_Dad-is-Byron_WEB-200x300.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/dad-is-byron/,"['Cultural/4.846153846153846', 'Society/2.7222222222222223', 'Politics/2.3692307692307697']","['Cultural', 'Society', 'Politics']",9.937606837606838,"['Language/3.076923076923077', 'Community/1.8888888888888888', 'Land/1.6']","['Language', 'Community', 'Land']",6.565811965811966,"['Individual_Personal/24.5999066293184', 'Cultural/17.228230266465566', 'Society/10.344992099403864']","['Individual_Personal', 'Cultural', 'Society']",52.17312899518784,"['Emotion/10.686080586080587', 'Mind/6.7162393162393155', 'Culture/6.430769230769231']","['Emotion', 'Mind', 'Culture']",23.833089133089132,0.6666666666666666,0.0
Xijing Men,"Welcome to Xijing – Xijing Olympics is the third of five chapters in the Xijing series. Produced concurrently to the 2008 Beijing Olympics, the Xijing Men stage their own versions of the Olympics, comprising events such as shot-put throwing with eggs, relay races with cigarettes instead of batons and marathon naps, often umpired by family members and children. Through slapstick skits they satirize the spectacle of stately ceremonies by playing on the absurdity of state pomp, for a reflection on modern society.","The Xijing Men hail, conceptually, from the fictitious city of Xijing, an imagined state in East Asia. The term Xijing meaning “western capital” etymologically draws from the names of cities in China, Korea and Japan. Relying on humor, satire, sarcasm and absurdity, the collective explores mythology, tradition, politics, government, and economics by staging mock cultural and sporting events.

Needless to say, he finds it everywhere: bottle caps, gummed hair, translucent miscellany, sick feathers, hot pink plastics, unknown, and more.

Something melting into yellow liquid. Various clumps, approximately a bracelet.

Michaël Borremans,"Michaël Borremans’ Black Mould series (2015) depicts a group of hooded and unidentifiable figures. The subjects are clothed in black robes, inspired by a paradoxical combination of Japanese Bunraka theatre costumes, Catholic Church dress, and black Ku Klux Klan clothing. The series is dark and ominous, reflecting what the artist considers to be the macabre reality of contemporaneity. Throughout the series, the subjects engage in perceived taboos: anal sex, or acts of violence, such as in Juggling with Fiery Limbs, as the title suggests, juggling with the limbs of a dead body. Predominant throughout the series is the presence of human flesh, which provokes an observation of the mystery of human relations and our twisted games. The series was painted while listening to the Jon Spencer Blues Explosion, with the song Black Mould inspiring the series.","Michael Borremans’ work includes drawings, paintings, and film that explore the absurdity of existence through their surreal imagery. His work, in its intimacy, and by his painterly gests, draws reference to Velásquez, Goya, and Manet. Currently based in Ghent, the artist focuses on imagination and symbolism in his work. Interweaving fluidity and opaque solidarity, Borremans provokes a haunting, nightmarish atmosphere in this oeuvre. His work often includes sombre figures, grotesque and dark imagery that is at once beautiful and disturbing. It is the unsettling ambiguity of the work that offers viewers space for their own idiosyncratic interpretations, rousing personal perspectives and life experiences imbued into the tableau.",Black Mould/Juggling with Fiery Limbs,Europe,"['black.n.01', 'series.n.01', 'black.a.01', 'human.a.01', 'song.n.01', 'theater.n.01', 'combination.n.01', 'japanese.a.01', 'game.n.01', 'presence.n.01', 'inspire.v.01', 'violence.n.01', 'world.n.03', 'figure.n.01', 'title.n.01', 'body.n.01']","['ghastly.s.01', 'taboo.n.02', 'violence.n.01', 'sex.n.04', 'human_body.n.01', 'phantasmagoric.s.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/BORMI0203.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/BORMI0203-169x300.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/black-mould-juggling-with-fiery-limbs/,"['Individual_Personal/3.723076923076923', 'Material_Physical/3.107692307692308', 'Politics/2.541176470588235']","['Individual_Personal', 'Material_Physical', 'Politics']",9.371945701357467,"['Space/2.307692307692308', 'Violence/1.9411764705882353', 'Body/1.9230769230769231']","['Space', 'Violence', 'Body']",6.171945701357466,"['Cultural/16.53832686920923', 'Material_Physical/12.887179487179491', 'Society/10.82469295410472']","['Cultural', 'Material_Physical', 'Society']",40.25019931049344,"['Space/7.146153846153846', 'Arts/6.018740573152337', 'Spirituality/4.090476190476191']","['Space', 'Arts', 'Spirituality']",17.255370609782375,0.3333333333333333,0.3333333333333333

The warm light and the color imbued on the simple boxes evoke a distant, or alien environment in which these objects seem to belong. The viewer is invited to question: is it dawn or dusk? Where would such warmth be so palpable, and at what time of year? Where do these boxes come from, and where will they go? The simplicity of this theme is provocative in itself, and is a gentle invitation to enquire into these seemingly unassuming objects.","Painting is at the center of the artist Bruno Pacheco’s practice. His paintings draw attention to a scene, a moment or an object, inviting the viewer to narrate the seemingly solitary objects. With a certain spontaneity, Bruno Pacheco crystallizes the gestures of the characters in his paintings. The different viewpoints are organized in order to construct a rhythmic visual narration. The cinematic approach of the artist enquires into form, frame and color. His approach opens a dialogue into the deconstruction of site and space through sequential and fragmentary research. Pacheco is currently based in London.","“Folding Box 5280”, “Folding Box 5282”",Europe,"['box.n.01', 'simple.a.01', 'remember.v.01', 'object.n.01', 'lose.v.01', 'environment.n.01', 'color.n.01', 'light.n.01', 'subject.n.01', 'practice.n.01', 'question.n.01', 'spectator.n.01', 'form.n.01', 'time.n.01', 'series.n.01']","['object.n.01', 'everyday.s.01', 'shape.n.01', 'color.n.01', 'simplicity.n.01', 'animalism.n.02']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Bruno-Pacheco_Folding-Box_5282.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Bruno-Pacheco_Folding-Box_5282-300x240.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/folding-box-5280-folding-box-5282/,"['Material_Physical/5.433333333333334', 'Society/1.6', 'Individual_Personal/1.6']","['Material_Physical', 'Society', 'Individual_Personal']",8.633333333333333,"['Materiality/3.6333333333333333', 'Design/1.0', 'Time/1.0']","['Materiality', 'Design', 'Time']",5.633333333333333,"['Society/10.955788982259573', 'Cultural/9.861080586080588', 'Material_Physical/6.952014652014651']","['Society', 'Cultural', 'Material_Physical']",27.76888422035481,"['Spirituality/3.257142857142857', 'Inequality/3.252777777777778', 'Culture/2.6654761904761903']","['Spirituality', 'Inequality', 'Culture']",9.175396825396826,0.6666666666666666,0.0
Shahzia Sikander,"Explosion of the Company Man, Series 1 is part of a larger series that explores Sikander’s ongoing interest in colonial history in the Indian subcontinent and in the British opium trade with China. Throughout the series we see an East India Company worker who appears in various forms and is the ‘exploding man.’ This piece is among the larger works in the series, which included miniatures and animations, referring to how the East India Company’s strategies from the seventeenth century continue to inform commercial activities today. Behind the blood-red flesh like dotting on the paper, we see what seems to be a Western, presumably British General in uniform with culottes and a hat. His face, in profile, appears to have the poise and posture of a nobleman, dignified in stature. The explosions that are superimposed over his fading figure draws the mind to Arabic script. The conversation between these two symbols in the painting evokes questions of authority, socio-cultural and political relations, and the memory of colonial legacies.","Shahzia Sikander is known for her richly layered and intricately detailed graphite, ink, and gouache paintings. She studied miniature painting in the late 1980s at the National College of Art in Lahore, Pakistan, with the forms and techniques of Indo-Persian miniatures heavily influencing her approach. Sikander’s practice explores the concepts of “East” and “West,” using traditional strategies of storytelling and themes of popular mythology to deconstruct the postcolonial legacy of the Indo-Persian region. In 2001, Sikander began to employ digital animation to create video works based on her drawings. Her practice traverses painting, drawing, animation, installation, and video, to radically rearticulate the tradition of miniature painting. Sikhander uses the technique to address contemporary issues, including the Western fear of Islam, the globalization of Western ways of living, and gender identity, focusing specifically on Muslim women in the West. The artist’s use of a traditional and scholarly approach to discuss the conflicts in the global condition creates a unique oeuvre–the digital animations, breathing new life into Mughal-era miniature painting.","Explosion of the Company Man, Series 1",Middle East & Africa,"['company.n.01', 'east.n.01', 'british.a.01', 'series.n.01', 'mind.n.01', 'animation.n.01', 'western.a.01', 'activity.n.01', 'conversation.n.01', 'worker.n.01', 'china.n.01', 'red.s.01', 'symbol.n.01', 'century.n.01', 'paper.n.01', 'memory.n.01', 'figure.n.01', 'question.n.01', 'political.a.01', 'piece.n.01', 'history.n.01', 'form.n.01']","['colonization.n.01', 'globalization.n.01', 'sex.n.04', 'mythology.n.01', 'trade.n.01', 'conflict.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Explosion-of-the-Company-Man-Series-1.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Explosion-of-the-Company-Man-Series-1-202x300.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/explosion-of-the-company-man-series-1/,"['Society/9.933972185365374', 'Politics/4.444444444444445', 'Individual_Personal/2.8']","['Society', 'Politics', 'Individual_Personal']",17.178416629809817,"['Economy/6.238734090127278', 'Power/1.9333333333333333', 'War/1.7619047619047619']","['Economy', 'Power', 'War']",9.933972185365374,"['Cultural/26.75677655677657', 'Individual_Personal/21.40750360750361', 'Society/16.646275946275953']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Society']",64.81055611055613,"['Arts/8.052747252747253', 'Spirituality/7.61135531135531', 'Mind/6.336441336441337']","['Arts', 'Spirituality', 'Mind']",22.0005439005439,0.6666666666666666,0.0
Xiaoyun Chen,"State Terrorism in the ultimate form of Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood features a portrait of the artist wearing a zipped utilitarian jacket reminiscent of a worker’s uniform, with one arm behind  his back as if forced to ingest a bundle of stick—a literal portrayal to the definition of fascism. The title alludes to the Pre-Raphaelite notion of a brotherhood based on “truth to nature.” Censorship of the mouth and indigestion of freshly cut stalks, central to Chen’s language of tree branches, feeds back provocatively  to the title’s suggestion of “state terrorism.” However, one must resist seeking symbolic meaning in the image as Chen’s focus is on the direct visual impact of the absurd act portrayed.","Chen Xiaoyun studied ink painting at the Chinese Academy of Arts and lived as a writer in Suzhou before becoming part of the Hangzhou video art community.

Xiaoyun Chen,"In the video work Drag, a man in a dark room pulls on the end of a rope. In midst of sounds of heavy breathing, the camera presents alternating scenes of a man and the shadow of a man wearing a long, pointed hat cast against a wall. Insinuating a sinister mood, the man and the shadow struggle to control the scene through alternating tugs and releases of a rope. The shadow dominates. Later, a human voice murmuring in low, deep tones provides a soundtrack to the visual ambiguity to produce and effect between something derivative of Plato’s “Allegory of the Cave” and a mockery of human desire and struggle. The video ends with an epigram added by Chen: “You cannot, could not, be in the dark, about all the darkness”, an ominous warning of play on words seemingly urges the viewer to approach the incoherent narrative as a layered incantation of play on shadows.","Chen Xiaoyun studied ink painting at the Chinese Academy of Arts and lived as a writer in Suzhou before becoming part of the Hangzhou video art community.

Xiaoyun Chen,"The lengthy titles in Chen Xiaoyun’s work often appear as colophons to his photographs that invite the viewer to a process of self realization through contemplating the distance between word and image. Near his studio, Chen often walks over fallen branches in late autumn and sense their existence. Thus, his placing them in diverse contexts builds a “narrative Ariadne’s thread” where the branches become “the language of things” intertextually cohering his oeuvre.  Each branch provokes a new instinctual art making process without assigning too much meaning. In this particular work, tree branches are covered in black paint that resembles petroleum in thick calligraphic splatters. Here, metaphors of artifice and reality, as well as wistful emotions of transient existence, are loosely gestured through the paint over tree branch, forming a poetics of nature akin to the airs of ancient Chinese poetic anthologies that Hangzhou artists often reference.","Chen Xiaoyun studied ink painting at the Chinese Academy of Arts and lived as a writer in Suzhou before becoming part of the Hangzhou video art community.

Wimo Ambala Bayang,"Composed of four images, the series Sleeping Elephant in the Axis of Yogyakarta (2011) explores the artist’s observation of how Javanese mythology and cosmology have marked the geography of Yogyakarta, the cultural centre of Indonesia. Through photomontage digital operation, an identical elephant is superimposed in front of iconic landmark of the city: Parangtritis Beach, Sultan Square, the City Monument and Mount Merapi. These four locations are spiritual symbols and the subject of cosmological beliefs in Indonesia and the imagery of elephant has long been considered as a cultural and religious icon. Closer observation reveals something uncanny about the images. On the one hand, the elephant is proportionally unbalanced in the composition and out of place; on the other, it is tilted, suspended and tied around a whimsical structure comprised of bamboo posts, wheels and wood slabs. The paradox created by the juxtaposition of the immobile and sacrificed elephant and the symbolic sites has a surreal and absurd effect, revealing the complexity and constraints of social and cultural conventions.","Working in photography and video, the Indonesian artist Wimo Ambala Bayang embraces the conceptual possibilities of digital image manipulation.

Ming Wong,"Making Chinatown (2012) is a remake of Roman Polanski’s 1974 classic neo-noir film Chinatown. According to Wong, the latter is a “textbook” of Hollywood filmmaking. In Ming’s version, he plays all four main characters portrayed originally by Jack Nicholson, Faye Dunaway, John Huston, and Belinda Palmer, shooting against a backdrop of a film set reproduced as wallpaper in a gallery space. Presented as a seven-channel video installation, Making Chinatown is an immersive viewing experience with different scenarios, lines of conversation, and background music, all merged together into one space where the sense of time collapses. The ending fades to black with no reference of the original film’s site, precisely echoing the fictional nature of Chinatown as a no-place, constructed in an often-detached cultural context.","Ming Wong’s practice has a profound connection with world cinema. Constantly drawing from classic films, Wong investigates issues around identity, linguistics, translation, dislocation, and history through reenactments of well-known films. Often using a deliberately low-budget aesthetic, he restages the films by appropriating and recontextualizing the main storylines and characters.

Michael Dean,"The sculpture shores shored (Working Title) makes reference to the human form. The two sides of the sculpture are distinctively different, with the rear showing an anamorphic-corrugated structure, the front suggesting the human form, making perhaps an unconscious reference to Giacometti or Barnett Newman. But whereas their work suggests immanence, Michael Dean refuses any notion of transcendence, remaining rooted in presentness. Through the inherent sense of interaction and participation with the sculptures, the spectator becomes another object when walking around the artist’s installations. shores shored (Working Title) is part of a series of sculptures Dean began with an invented typography. Using the letters as the structure of the work — the transformation of words to material — the viewer is nonetheless unable to decipher the hence constructed words in the series. The basis of this series is the words shore and shoring. The seashore was important to Dean growing up in Newcastle as it was a place of rêverie (suggesting escape) and also a barrier. The shore is a liminal space, just as these sculptures hover between abstract construction, letters, human form and landscape.","Michael Dean (b. 1977, Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom) collectively engages with performance, sculpture, writing, publication and installation in a process where each method practice mutually informs the other. Working with ‘poor’ materials: concrete, corrugated iron, steel, sand and pebbles, Dean’s installation recall shantytowns. The artist’s 2016 exhibition Sic Glyphs at South London Gallery was held at the debut of the media’s fixation on the immigration crisis. The installation of the exhibition echoed this media phenomenon. Blocking the normal entrance to the gallery, the visitor had to find their way around the back of the gallery, capturing glimpses of the interior as they navigated their way through barriers of sculptures. Through this, Dean attempted to evoke the same sensation one might feel in the chaos of an immigration settlement, such as the internment camp ‘the Jungle’ in Calais, France, where one is almost granted asylum, yet denied entry. The do-it-yourself materials employed by Dean further recall the emergency housing built by asylum seekers. While Dean’s practice is deeply rooted in the contemporary socio-political milieu, the artist equally explores the forms and history of sculpture from Giacometti through to Arte Povera.",shores shored (Working Title),Europe,"['sculpture.n.01', 'human.a.01', 'structure.n.01', 'mention.n.01', 'form.n.01', 'title.n.01', 'spectator.n.01', 'series.n.01', 'transformation.n.01', 'installation.n.01', 'abstract.a.01', 'construction.n.01', 'impression.n.01', 'sense.n.01', 'landscape.n.01', 'object.n.01', 'space.n.01']","['anamorphic.a.01', 'body.n.01', 'sculpture.n.02', 'abstract.s.02', 'human_body.n.01', 'landscape.n.02']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Michael-Dean.png,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Michael-Dean-245x300.png,https://kadist.org/work/shores-shored-working-title/,"['Cultural/14.679325765393882', 'Material_Physical/12.092307692307692', 'Individual_Personal/3.565182186234818']","['Cultural', 'Material_Physical', 'Individual_Personal']",30.336815643936394,"['Arts/11.545992432060546', 'Space/8.653846153846155', 'Body/1.9230769230769231']","['Arts', 'Space', 'Body']",22.122915508983624,"['Cultural/24.658617036558226', 'Material_Physical/9.37774186597716', 'Individual_Personal/8.564590964590964']","['Cultural', 'Material_Physical', 'Individual_Personal']",42.600949867126346,"['Arts/12.963694965165557', 'Design/3.885470085470086', 'Values/3.4571428571428573']","['Arts', 'Design', 'Values']",20.306307907778496,1.0,0.3333333333333333
Baris Dogrusöz,"The series of works gathered under the title Heure de Paris combines footage of Turkey from Turkish and French media reportage from the 1980s. Using archival material, including maps, television emissions, footage, Dogrusöz’s brings to light the state monopoly on radio and TV that ended in 1994 and the impact this had on documentation and reportage in this period.  In Heure de Paris: The map and the territory, Dogrusöz collected and displays all the occurrences where maps of Turkey, frequently used in public French television, were reported. A video in loop played these reports from September 12, 1980, the date of the military coup d’état, to August 11, 1994, the date when the TURKSAT 1B satellite was placed in orbit. Reproductions of these maps are displayed on the wall behind the screens and organized in sequence, keeping the format of running 25 frames per second in moving image, and presenting a 14-year period of the recent history of Turkey. These sequences, gathered on 17 posters, describe a new way to narrate this history from the perspective of Turks living overseas during this period of time. The pattern that emerges from the changing landscape of the maps indicates a geo-political situation that remains very relevant today.","Baris Dogrusöz’s practice (b. 1978, Istanbul) examines the question of representation and conflicts through signs and archives that are intended to define a formal language for describing geopolitical tensions.

Lawrence Abu Hamdan,"In May 2014, Israeli soldiers shot and killed two teenagers, Nadeem Nawara and Mohamad Abu Daher in occupied Palestine (West Bank). Through the Forensic Architecture program, the human rights organization Defence for Children International worked with Abu Hamdan to investigate the incident. The case hinged upon an audio-ballistic analysis of the recorded gunshots to determine whether the soldiers had used rubber bullets, as they asserted, or broken the law by firing live ammunition at the two unarmed teenagers.  A detailed acoustic analysis, for which Abu Hamdan used special techniques designed to visualize the sound frequencies, established that they had fired live rounds, and moreover had tried to disguise these fatal shots to make them sound as if they were rubber bullets. These visualizations later became the crucial piece of evidence that was picked up by the news channel CNN and other international news agencies, forcing Israel to renounce its original denial.  The video Rubber Coated Steel is the main part of the installation Earshot commissioned by Portikus. Shot in an indoor shooting range, the piece is a staged enactment of a tribunal heard. The images presented are spectrograms: visualizations of the frequency spectrum of a given signal—in this instance, of the sounds of various projectiles. The spectrograms depict the timing, pitch, and loudness of projectiles ranging from a sound grenade across a rubber bullet to live ammunition fired from an M-16 rifle. The voice over reenacts the dialogues that have happened or could have happened at the tribunal. The video does not preside over the voices of the victims but rather seeks to amplify their silence, fundamentally questioning the relationship between truth and sound and the ways in which rights are being heard today.","What are the political implication of our sounds and voices? How is it heard and used for or against us? These are questions posed by Lawrence Abu Hamdan (b. 1985, Amman, Jordan) an artist and “private ear” currently based in Berlin. His work deals with the politics of listening through audiovisual installations, performances, graphic works, photography, Islamic sermons, cassette tape compositions, essays, and lectures. The artist’s research is also used in legal and human rights contexts. The artist’s forensic audio investigations Freedom of speech itself (2012) have been submitted as evidence in the UK immigration and asylum tribunal and most recently his research leading to Rubber Coated Steel (2016), which was part of the campaign for Defense for Children International.",Rubber Coated Steel,Europe,"['shooting.n.01', 'sound.n.01', 'soldier.n.01', 'voice.n.01', 'piece.n.01', 'west.n.01', 'plan.v.03', 'dialogue.n.01', 'plan.n.01', 'technique.n.01', 'video.n.01', 'architecture.n.01', 'child.n.01', 'original.s.01', 'relationship.n.01', 'human.a.01']","['violence.n.01', 'testimony.n.01', 'witness.n.01', 'sound.n.01', 'geopolitics.n.01', 'conflict.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Rubber-coated-steel-still-1.png,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Rubber-coated-steel-still-1-300x169.png,https://kadist.org/work/rubber-coated-steel/,"['Politics/7.1770739064856715', 'Society/5.510873440285206', 'Cultural/4.799614420667052']","['Politics', 'Society', 'Cultural']",17.487561767437928,"['Violence/2.8745098039215686', 'Power/2.7333333333333334', 'Activism/2.5104072398190045']","['Violence', 'Power', 'Activism']",8.118250377073906,"['Cultural/9.025025138260434', 'Individual_Personal/5.9839689722042655', 'Society/4.971794871794872']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Society']",19.98078898225957,"['Values/4.137815126050421', 'Land/4.038461538461539', 'Arts/2.6985294117647056']","['Values', 'Land', 'Arts']",10.874806076276666,0.6666666666666666,0.0
Corey McCorkle,"Corey McCorkle’s 2016 installation Pendulum is developed around the Cavendish family and their role in importing bananas to Europe. Cavendish bananas were named after William Cavendish, the 6th Duke of Devonshire. In 1834, Cavendish received a shipment of bananas from Mauritius, and developed these bananas in the greenhouses of Chatsworth House with his gardener Sir Joseph Paxton, and were later given to missionary John Williams to take to Samoa. In combining the colonial history of the Cavendish banana that has become the most consumed banana in the western world, and the history of the pendulum, a device used to measure human movement through time, length and gravity, McCorkle’s Pendulum evokes the past and the present in an intervention bound to decay.","Described as a ‘spatial interventionist’, Corey McCorkle is a New York-based artist and trained architect, working in photography, architectural interventions, sculpture, installations, and films. He is interested in the utopian ideas of nature and transcendence, developed often as a response to an invitation to intervene in a specific site. In studying and responding to a space, McCorkle’s practice seeks to disrupt, mutate, manipulate or enhance the environment of his interventions.

POPE.L,"“When Pope.L shakes his head he makes drawings that keep him from laugh-­crying to death,” writes Helen Molesworth about William Pope.L’s Skin Set Drawings. Made with very low­-key materials, this extended corpus of drawings deals with the absurdities and perversities of intentional language, especially racist language and language associated with categorizing and naming color.

Among his best-known works are the crawls, a series of performances staged since 1978, in which he inches his way through busy city streets on his belly, back, hands, and knees in an attempt to draw attention to the plight of those members of society who are least empowered.

McCallum + Tarry,"In Endurance, 26 homeless youths stand still looking directly into the camera for an hour without speaking. As each stands, the video is rendered with a time-lapsed effect in which traffic and pedestrians pass by and light fades into night and back again; during the transition from one youth/performer to the next, the video reverts into slow-time. The audio tracks on the video combine street sounds with edited sequences of the pre-recorded interviews. Every hour of real-time performance is compressed to 5 minutes, creating a finished work of two hours. Each youth who took part in this collective action dedicated their participation to the memory of friends who died from life on the streets, and thus “stood for” those individuals who were absent. This memorial gesture also serves as a quiet act of civil disobedience in opposition to the Seattle Civility Laws that make standing or sitting motionless a crime.  A collaborative artist team since 1998, Bradley McCallum and Jacqueline Tarry have worked and exhibited globally, seeking to surface and discuss issues revolving around marginalized members of society. Their work, which moves fluidly between large-scale public projects, performative sculpture, painting, photography, video and self-portraiture, challenges audiences to face issues of race and social justice in communities, history, and the family. Embedded within their work, whether it is of an historical, personal, or civic-based nature, is their ability to address the complicated and layered issues of race and power as a mixed-race artists collaborative.",,Endurance,Americas,"['race.n.01', 'issue.n.01', 'street.n.01', 'video.n.01', 'interview.n.01', 'light.a.01', 'passage.n.01', 'night.n.01', 'sequence.n.01', 'resistance.n.01', 'audience.n.01', 'corporate.s.03', 'community.n.01', 'gesture.n.01', 'sound.n.01', 'person.n.01', 'personal.a.01', 'photography.n.01', 'society.n.01', 'family.n.01', 'action.n.01', 'public.a.01', 'historical.a.01', 'artist.n.01', 'power.n.01']","['young_person.n.01', 'homeless.n.01', 'death.n.01', 'activism.n.01', 'loss.n.01', 'marginalization.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/IMG_endurance.jpeg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/IMG_endurance-300x169.jpeg,https://kadist.org/work/endurance/,"['Society/2.6333333333333337', 'Politics/2.0', 'Material_Physical/1.6923076923076925']","['Society', 'Politics', 'Material_Physical']",6.325641025641026,"['Urbanization/1.8333333333333335', 'Body/1.0', 'Inequality/1.0']","['Urbanization', 'Body', 'Inequality']",3.8333333333333335,"['Individual_Personal/24.17899159663867', 'Society/23.73353897564425', 'Politics/21.253535353535362']","['Individual_Personal', 'Society', 'Politics']",69.16606592581829,"['Power/9.142424242424243', 'Body/7.332105149752208', 'Community/6.983130904183536']","['Power', 'Body', 'Community']",23.457660296359986,0.6666666666666666,0.3333333333333333
Nicholas Mangan,"Executed in 2012, A World Undone revolves around a single, metaphorically rich substance, drawing on geological research into an ancient mineral, Zircon, unearthed in remote Western Australia. These rocks are now studied, like a time capsule, revealing intriguing clues about the state of the planet more than 4 billion years ago. Mangan procured a sample of the material and reduced it to a fine dust that he then filmed, in flux, with a high-speed video camera. Though drawing on ‘hard’ science and rooted in empirical techniques, the piece explores the aesthetic, philosophical and even mythological potential of cutting-edge geophysical research.  Nicholas Mangan’s research-driven practice gives rise to films, videos, and installations dealing primarily with histories of contested sites and materials. A keen awareness of media and their own (art) histories informs his finished works. The unifying themes of Mangan’s oeuvre to date include the geopolitics and economics of energy, and histories of exchange and wealth, both timely issues in the era of ‘post-peak’ fossil fuels and neoliberal globalization. Much of Mangan’s research focuses on the geography of the Pacific Rim, an emerging pivot of the neo-colonial global economy which also harbors a certain unconscious of Euro-American anthropological and economic thought.",,A World Undone [Protolith],Asia,"['material.n.01', 'analyze.v.01', 'history.n.01', 'ancient.s.01', 'western.a.01', 'exchange.n.01', 'economy.n.01', 'era.n.01', 'aesthetic.a.01', 'installation.n.01', 'global.s.01', 'rock.n.01', 'technique.n.01', 'video.n.01', 'economic.a.01', 'issue.n.01', 'individual.a.01', 'medium.n.01', 'subject.n.01', 'practice.n.01', 'camera.n.01', 'piece.n.01', 'movie.n.01', 'time.n.01']","['geopolitics.n.01', 'geology.n.01', 'globalization.n.01', 'fossil_fuel.n.01', 'economy.n.02', 'science.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/IMG_Installation-view-3_WEB.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/IMG_Installation-view-3_WEB-300x200.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/a-world-undone-protolith/,"['Cultural/19.881101036905996', 'Material_Physical/11.76116113736251', 'Individual_Personal/5.725092355782893']","['Cultural', 'Material_Physical', 'Individual_Personal']",37.3673545300514,"['Physics/8.258768792864903', 'Technology/5.892543859649122', 'Language/5.731652661064425']","['Physics', 'Technology', 'Language']",19.882965313578453,"['Cultural/31.781261222437706', 'Society/22.063481289951884', 'Material_Physical/21.63856731503791']","['Cultural', 'Society', 'Material_Physical']",75.48330982742749,"['Media/12.58013179630827', 'Space/8.769683257918551', 'History/7.15595238095238']","['Media', 'Space', 'History']",28.5057674351792,0.6666666666666666,0.0
Shimabuku,"For the two-channel work Asking the Repentistas – Peneira & Sonhador – to remix my octopus works Shimabuku asked two Brazilian street singers to compose a ballad about his previous works with octopi (in which he created traditional Japanese ceramic vessels to catch octopi, with a fisherman who took him on his boat to test them out as we can see on one of the channel). In the Brazilian singers’ ballad, Shimabuku is transformed into a fisherman, the greatest fisherman in Japan, but a kindly fisherman who returns his catch to the sea. The artwork thus becomes facilitator for an interaction between different cultures and interpretations.","Born in 1969 in Kobe, Shimabuku is an artist who collects unusual encounters. When he was younger, he wanted to become a poet or tourist guide. Today he is an artist, producer and smuggler of stories, customs and myths which he observes and collects on his journeys. Taking on the role of a Candide-like figure, Shimabuku travels the world, interacts with strangers, and converses with nature, instigating moments of poetry, humor, and wonderment, but also creating bridges between the specificities of different cultures and localities (nowadays a relevant position, considering our global world as a made up of a multitude of localities). Each of his works (including videos, sculptural installations, performance documentations, and photography) tells the story of these improbable encounters across borders, species, and states of being.

Sutthirat Supaparinya,"When Need Moves the Earth is a three-channel video that combines elements of documentary footage, archival material and abstract aerial shots to encompass a painterly yet forthright exploration of a coal mine and a water dam in Thailand. A meditation on the impact of industrialization on the natural environment, the work highlights the drastic alterations that these operations leave in its place.  Sutthirat Supaparinya’s work is often a commentary on political, social, and personal issues. She considers and decodes public information to reveal the structures that affect us and the world we live in. Questioning how we value what is ‘natural’ or ‘man-made’; or what is ‘truth’ or ‘fiction’, her most recent projects investigate the social and environmental impact of industrial activity and in parallel, governmental control in Thailand.

Maria Taniguchi,"Untitled (Celestial Motors) is a visual meditation on an icon of modern urban Philippine life—the jeepney. This ubiquitous form of public transportation, originally built from U.S. military jeeps left on the islands after World War II, is normally exuberantly painted and personalized. They are known for their crowded seating and kitsch decorations, which have become an omnipresent symbol of Philippine culture. Taniguchi’s formal video portrait focuses on a gleaming stainless-steel example, fresh from the Celestial Motors factory. Stripped into its basic form and shot against a white backdrop, almost like an advertisement, Untitled (Celestial Motors) bears the jeepney as an object of study. Nearly static, abstracted details of the jeepney are intercut with deliberate pans across its body.  Throughout her paintings, sculptures, and videos, Maria Taniguchi unpacks knowledge and experience—connecting material culture, technology, and natural evolution—and investigates space and time, along with social and historical contexts. Whether with her quasi-abstract brick paintings or with the moving images of plain and everyday objects, Taniguchi enforces the action of viewing upon our senses. The consequence is the reinterpretation of the objects, and the attainment of sensorial and cognitive experiences.","Throughout her paintings, sculptures, and videos, Maria Taniguchi unpacks knowledge and experience—connecting material culture, technology, and natural evolution—and investigates space and time, along with social and historical contexts.

Haig Aivazian,"This work is part of an ongoing project that looks at international sports competitions as a revealing element of nationalistic aspirations which present contradictions.  The starting point of this work was inspired by private companies which were responsible for the security of the Olympic Games in England and also supply equipment for immigrant detention camps and prisons.  This work questions the use of the stadiums other than for sports competitions. Reference is clearly made to the Vélodrome d’Hiver or the detention camps during the Vichy regime under Pinochet or the Talibans but also their requisition during natural disasters like after hurricane Katrina in New Orleans. The lighting creates a frame that obstructs the stadium with a luminous mass in suspension, creating a strange apparition in the darkness and a mixed feeling, between violence and fascination. The title comes from a short poem written by the artist that alludes to separation and distance. These blinding lights replace the moon light. The charcoal is used to create a contrast with this idea of light. This is what remains when the light has been fully consumed and all that is left are ashes. This work is the sequel of a video that dealt with the three adolescents that were electrocuted in Clichy-sous-Bois in 2005 and the protests that followed with the burning of cars.","Haig Aivazian was born in 1980 in Beirut. As an artist and curator he creates installations, drawings, sculpture and performances that connect a political reflection to biographical references.","At every sunset, I think of you.

Edith DEKYNDT,"The raw materials used in Edith Dekyndt’s work are as intangible as the light, the wind, magnetic waves or the cold…  This artist has conceived works for many years, which she considers “neither spectacular, nor consumable”. She questions the relationship between the world of facts, science and experience on one hand and an eminently subjective approach to the world in what she calls a “universal search of subjectivity”.  Thus the immediate perception of objects that she submits to the spectators is questioned by the paradoxical simplicity of the natural phenomena that she records. The artist then develops an implicit critique of scientific objectivity and suggests that art is a field of knowledge on its own.  Edith Dekyndt looks at the waters of the Dead Sea, that become almost an abstract undersea landscape. The exceptional physical qualities of this salt water make this an unusual study: depth, weightlessness floating, where the presence of salt eradicates any possible life form. Edith Dekyndt films the emptiness and the supposed absence in this sea, in which we can, however, notice an immense richness of movements and colors due to light variations of light. In Dead Sea Drawings, the artist films the surface of the sea, under which she places a white sheet of paper. The shadows of the minerals present at the surface of the water create a random drawing, like an infinite variation of designs. She reminds the spectators that this sea and its coast have been witness to thousands of years of history, different religions and are still marked today by three distinct political entities. This work is part of a project called Lot’s wife (La Femme de Loth), which refers to a passage in the Book of Genesis in which the patriarch, Lot, and his family run away from Sodom and Gomorrah during the destruction of the two cities. Disobeying the Angel’s command not to look back, Lot’s wife turns into a salt statue. For this project the artist has made a series of drawings where the salt creates hollows in the paper, distorts it, damages it and in doing so, creates forms and designs.","Born in 1960, Ieper, BelgiumLives and works in Belgium",Dead Sea Drawing,Europe,"['sea.n.01', 'water.n.01', 'design.n.01', 'drawing.n.01', 'paper.n.01', 'surface.n.01', 'light.n.01', 'undertaking.n.01', 'spectator.n.01', 'wave.n.01', 'cognition.n.01', 'phenomenon.n.01', 'record.n.01', 'field.n.01', 'sheet.n.01', 'destruction.n.01', 'percept.n.01', 'light.a.01', 'shadow.n.01', 'passage.n.01', 'form.n.01', 'survey.n.01', 'colors.n.01', 'approach.n.01', 'quality.n.01']","['natural_phenomenon.n.01', 'light.n.01', 'dead_sea.n.01', 'subjectivity.n.01', 'intangible.n.01', 'salt.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/dead_sea_drawing.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/dead_sea_drawing-300x169.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/dead-sea-drawing/,"['Material_Physical/4.205128205128205', 'Society/1.6666666666666667', 'Individual_Personal/1.0']","['Material_Physical', 'Society', 'Individual_Personal']",6.871794871794872,"['Economy/1.6666666666666667', 'Environmental/1.6025641025641026', 'Physics/1.6025641025641026']","['Economy', 'Environmental', 'Physics']",4.871794871794872,"['Cultural/28.439469336992566', 'Material_Physical/21.380958240246173', 'Society/20.22159188196677']","['Cultural', 'Material_Physical', 'Society']",70.0420194592055,"['Arts/8.084213172448466', 'Mind/7.573382173382173', 'Time/6.639188752424046']","['Arts', 'Mind', 'Time']",22.296784098254683,0.6666666666666666,0.0
Laure Prouvost,"In Stong Sory Vegetables, Laure Prouvost explains that she woke up one morning and that some vegetables had fallen from the sky on her bed, making a hole in her ceiling. Each video, in this series, is an odd still life representation turning everyday elements into imaginary and funny stories. A tomato, an onion, a lemon and a carrot are displayed in front of the monitor as relics. These vegetables are also present, outside the monitor, to assure the spectators as well that the stories we are hearing are true.  The artist invites us to participate in her stories, and to sort out the inextricable connections between language, image and perception. In many of her videos, Laure Prouvost uses as a starting point her own family life, her acquaintances or even her pets. Her daily stories drift quickly towards odd and funny connections. Thus, in the video Stong Sory, the artist prepares a beautiful cake for her brother’s birthday, which contains living surprises such as spiders and birds.

Loretta Fahrenholz,"Loretta Fahrenholz’s video is composed of a patchwork of sequences. She constructs her film by juxtaposing stylized takes of street dance performances or images of the disasters at Far Rockaway caused by hurricane Sandy.  A dancer goes back and forth in a corridor, a crooked silhouette contorts itself from anxiety on an unmade bed, bodies collapsed on the ground suddenly come to life, dancers, characterized by pixilated gestures, pretend to fight to the death. Their movements are robots-like: the machine man and the zombie only belong to fiction.  “Ditch Plains” strongly raises questions related to technology and man caught up in mediatized environments. The hip-hop music accentuates the resemblance with to a trashy horror movie. Loretta Fahrenholz manages to capture the odd or intimate moments that occur in these little communities, moments where one forgets the presence of the camera.",born 1981 in Starnberglives and works in Berlin.,Ditch Plains,Europe,"['moment.n.01', 'dance.n.01', 'movie.n.01', 'machine.n.01', 'land.n.04', 'sequence.n.01', 'technology.n.01', 'music.n.01', 'fiction.n.01', 'compose.v.01', 'death.n.01', 'community.n.01', 'presence.n.01', 'gesture.n.01', 'environment.n.01', 'street.n.01', 'motion.n.03', 'performance.n.01', 'camera.n.01', 'question.n.01', 'body.n.01', 'life.n.01', 'video.n.01', 'image.n.01']","['fabrication.n.01', 'reality.n.02', 'technology.n.01', 'hip-hop.n.01', 'juxtaposition.n.01', 'spectator.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/dp.still030.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/dp.still030-300x169.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/ditch-plains/,"['Cultural/11.570415858651154', 'Individual_Personal/3.138461538461539', 'Material_Physical/2.6923076923076925']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Material_Physical']",17.401185089420387,"['Fantasy/2.9230769230769234', 'Materiality/2.6923076923076925', 'Technology/1.9']","['Fantasy', 'Materiality', 'Technology']",7.515384615384615,"['Cultural/39.64125906772966', 'Material_Physical/24.75575845722905', 'Individual_Personal/13.125333979745747']","['Cultural', 'Material_Physical', 'Individual_Personal']",77.52235150470446,"['Arts/13.969087122028302', 'Materiality/7.53052503052503', 'Space/7.169683257918551']","['Arts', 'Materiality', 'Space']",28.669295410471882,1.0,0.3333333333333333
Marc Nagtzaam,"Nagtzaam’s medium is drawing and his repertory of forms varies from abstract hard-edge and wall drawing to the reproduction of written material that he collects from art magazines. The artist uses abstract architectural elements that he reproduces on the wall in which he inserts drawings, elements from photographs and drawings of texts collected from art magazines. The repetition, control and imperfection of the movements create a tension, a particular vibration in his geometrical drawings and in the drawings of texts. The idea of repetition, of a copy, appears as an essential ritual element and a ritual in the artist’s work process. Despite a kind of austerity and the evocation of a minimal and conceptual aesthetic, a light goes through his composition giving his work an organic dimension. Exhibition walls, random perspectives and frontal hangings provoke a sort of dizziness and of virtual upheaval.  This work is composed of two wall drawings and three drawings on paper (a protocol allows the installation in different spaces). The artist’s idea is to merge different spaces together, to affirm their existence while denying it (confronting tangible and virtual space). The drawings hung in these spaces reproduces the traces of previous works, in memory of previous projects and past actions. The drawing made out of texts is a patchwork of fragments of sentences coming from Asian magazines. These fragments evoke a different place where the snippets of words complete and contradict each other, and seem to describe, explain as well as disappear. The architectural skeleton, its absence of density, suspends the time of physical experience. Wavering and steadiness are put to test in a strangely experienced period of time.","1968, Helmond, the Netherlands",Installation #1,Europe,"['drawing.n.01', 'magazine.n.01', 'architectural.a.01', 'repeat.n.01', 'fragment.n.01', 'wall.n.01', 'abstract.a.01', 'space.n.01', 'elements.n.01', 'idea.n.01', 'control.n.01', 'being.n.01', 'kind.n.01', 'conceptual.s.01', 'component.n.01', 'dimension.n.01', 'trace.n.01', 'time.n.01', 'write.v.01', 'tension.n.01', 'compose.v.01', 'time_period.n.01', 'physical.a.01', 'paper.n.01', 'composition.n.01']","['architecture.n.02', 'time.n.05', 'fragment.n.03', 'tension.n.03', 'abstraction.n.04', 'contradiction.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/MN_I_1.001.O.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/MN_I_1.001.O-300x200.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/installation-1/,"['Cultural/18.589456484348133', 'Material_Physical/8.011111111111111', 'Society/3.2040100250626566']","['Cultural', 'Material_Physical', 'Society']",29.804577620521904,"['Arts/9.52703818369453', 'Technology/4.083333333333333', 'Time/3.6666666666666665']","['Arts', 'Technology', 'Time']",17.277038183694533,"['Individual_Personal/26.82195059842119', 'Cultural/20.058453120143795', 'Material_Physical/13.431113331113329']","['Individual_Personal', 'Cultural', 'Material_Physical']",60.311517049678315,"['Mind/9.30769230769231', 'Media/7.629017490936995', 'Values/7.576729153199741']","['Mind', 'Media', 'Values']",24.513438951829045,0.6666666666666666,0.0
Rachel Rose,"A minute Ago starts with a hailstorm pelting down unexpectedly on a quiet beach in Siberia. People, half naked, run for cover under towels and parasols, to the music of the Pink Floyd.  The next scene is an interview of Philip Johnson, filmed 10 years before in the Glass House he constructed. Johnson was 90 years old then. At this point in the video there is a kind of digital sound that interrupts the high definition image, moving to the rhythm of a wood percussion musical composition by Steve Reich. The house, surrounded by an extraordinary landscape, is then bombarded by hail, the soundtrack becomes a live concert interrupted by the yelling and cheering of the public.  The painting Landscape with the funeral of Phocion by Poussin is the only image in the house. It shows a hearse going through fields to the burial place. The image duplicates itself with the deconstruction of the video image, the rain which pixelates the screen, the soundtrack which chops up this time space.","For artist Rachel Rose, the current moment is one of shifting terrain: as technology advances, the world changes beneath and around us, leaving us struggling to keep up. Rose is interested in the rapidly changing conditions we live in, and the ways that language, technology, and images mediate the out-of-sync realities of our organic lives.

Fabien Giraud & Raphael Siboni,"The Unmanned, is composed of several 26min episodes, it is a fictional documentary about the history of humanity faced with technology acceleration. Each episode dramatizes a “singular” encounter between man and machine. Each episode is filmed with a different camera (a preprogrammed machine or a drone).  The title The Unmanned – in French, ‘an uninhabited machine’ highlights perfectly the subject and the method used by the artists.  The series uses as a starting point Ray Kurzweil (RK), a researcher described as the “the pioneer of Silicon Valley”. Kurzweil popularized the theory of singularity, as a point of “discontinuity” or inevitable rupture where a machine auto-generates itself to overtake man. Fabien Giraud and Raphael Siboni’s series starts with Ray Kurzweil’s death and the beginning of the machine reign. For Ray Kurzweil and many other positivist researchers, the theory of singularity goes along with an important financial and political project. Considerable investments (particularly from Google where RK heads of a laboratory) apply especially to genetics and biotechnology. Kurzweil’s real project lies behind the theory of singularity: immortality through technological rebirth. This research aims at slowing down the process of aging and bringing our parents back to life. Episode 1 is an image of the world in 2045, as seen by Kurzweil. He would then be 97 years old and spend his time with a young child improving his education. This portrait is the accomplishment of Ray Kurzweil’s reasoning project, the moment when he would have brought back his father (Friedrich Kurzweil).  Therefore the series starts from the end, 2045, the moment where Ray Kurzweil can finally die because he is replaced by his son who is actually his father. The episode was filmed by a drone in a tropical forest of Mexico.","Fabien Giraud (born in 1980) and Raphael Siboni (born in 1981) live and work in Paris, France","2045–The Death of Ray Kurzweil (""The Unmanned"" series)",Europe,"['episode.n.01', 'machine.n.01', 'father.n.01', 'film.v.01', 'undertaking.n.01', 'moment.n.01', 'documentary.n.01', 'series.n.01', 'method.n.01', 'fictional.a.01', 'brush.n.06', 'bring.v.01', 'mexico.n.01', 'head.n.01', 'technology.n.01', 'compose.v.01', 'death.n.01', 'child.n.01', 'real.a.01', 'portrayal.n.01', 'artist.n.01', 'subject.n.01', 'camera.n.01', 'procedure.n.01', 'title.n.01']","['technology.n.01', 'machine.n.01', 'biotechnology.n.01', 'genetics.n.01', 'resurrection.n.02', 'age.n.03']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/episode_1_-_02_.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/episode_1_-_02_-300x169.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/death-ray-kurzweil/,"['Cultural/12.894887955182073', 'Material_Physical/7.087868653086044', 'Individual_Personal/5.982564102564102']","['Cultural', 'Material_Physical', 'Individual_Personal']",25.96532071083222,"['Technology/8.042787114845938', 'Physics/3.984189723320158', 'Familial/3.5942857142857143']","['Technology', 'Physics', 'Familial']",15.62126255245181,"['Cultural/25.282649213531574', 'Society/14.776000143647206', 'Individual_Personal/12.692929438982071']","['Cultural', 'Society', 'Individual_Personal']",52.75157879616085,"['Technology/7.250113122171946', 'Arts/5.85359477124183', 'Media/4.904201680672269']","['Technology', 'Arts', 'Media']",18.007909574086046,0.6666666666666666,0.3333333333333333

Designed by Polish architect Karol Shayer, it was destroyed in 2008 (date of the project’s creation). This project is multifaceted, always transforming into different forms and involving a series of collaborations: the first step took place as part of the “traveling curtains project”, which consisted in recuperating the curtains from the Carlton hotel before its demolition and sending them to different cities throughout the world where they would be subject to new interventions and transformations by artists, among whom Marwa Arsanios.  A video records the collecting of the curtains. The second step consisted in the transformation of the collected curtains, turned into fashionable clothing items.

Marwa Arsanios,"I’ve heard stories (2008) is one of Marwa Arsanios early works. It is a short animated film staging a story that took place at the Carlton hotel in Beirut. This work is the first part of a longer project on this iconic building.  In I’ve heard stories, Marwa Arsanios attempts to piece together rumors surrounding the now demolished Hotel Carlton. The hotel was a popular meeting place for gay men living in Beirut, Lebanon, where homosexual acts are considered illegal. At that time (1973 to 1993), the hotel was also the setting of three murders that might or might not have been related to these sexual encounters. Among the victim of these (probably) passionate crimes was the Lebanese politician and businessman Henri Pharaoun. Known as a collector and the richest man in Lebanon during most of his lifetime, Pharaoun was stabbed multiple times by an unknown assailant (his lover, driver or cook). Nora was the only witness to this murder. The nature of the murders went unreported. The animation explores different ways of narrating Arsanios’ reconstruction of the event through drawings and videos, gossip and facts, in an effort to give these crimes their place in the history of the city.","Marwa Arsanios is born in 1978 in Washington, United-States.Lives and works in Beyrouth, Lebanon.

Setareh Shahbazi,"Shahbazi’s early drawings in the series “Oh No…” are reminiscent of comic strips or children’s coloring books. Subjects are rendered graphically and set against flat solid colors. The origin of these drawings is a mix of her own collection of images and the Arab Image Foundation’s collection in Beirut, Lebanon. Shahbazi’s most recent work “Spectral Days” takes an introspective turn through a series of photomontages that are based on hundreds of roughly scanned family photographs. Creating spectral figures, Shahbazi delves into the loaded history of her family’s exile from Iran following the revolution. Like the rest of her work, which is built on the logic of free association, these images resist a literal or a linear reading while simultaneously speaking of and surpassing the context from which they were born.

Yusuke Yamatani,"In his series Tsugi no yoru e (Onto the next night), 2010, Yamatani gives viewers access to the wild world of young rockers and skaters. He prints their idiosyncratic life in ferrotyped gelatin silver prints. Using this forgotten printing process to depict his generation, he manages successfully to reevaluate a classic approach with a fresh understanding of it. The six black-and-white works in the Kadist collection come from this Osaka project and present a kind of portrait of youth who meet up over skateboarding and congregate around punk rock concerts. Out of their ennui comes a creative freedom expressed through lifestyle.","Yusuke Yamatani grew up playing music with several different punk bands. He continued his music while studying philosophy at Rissho University in Tokyo. At twenty-two, Yamatani decided he wanted to be able to accomplish something on his own, rather than be identified as part of a music group. He turned to photography, initially using a girlfriend’s camera. He moved to Nagasaki, where he studied with Shomei Tomatsu, who became a major influence as he embarked on a career on his own as a photographer. After several years he returned to Tokyo, but soon moved away from the capital to Osaka, where he believed he would be able to capture something local.

It’s contrasting dark and vibrant tones presage his later series of works, exhibited at L.A.’s Hammer Museum as Scorched Earth. These larger works share a map-like quality, looking like aerial views of some scarred urban landscape. Black and red lines sear across the compositions, made through Bradford’s unique layering and burning techniques. The 2012 print—a small shard, perhaps, from one of these larger views of the land—shares this approach. Greyed fragments crisp along the edges into rock-like formations, engulfed in the umber and orange colors of fire.","Born and raised in Los Angeles, artist Mark Bradford draws material, inspiration, and methods from the city streets that surround him. His large-scaled collage paintings for which he is known are often built up through layers of repurposed street advertisements, hair papers, flyers, and scraps. Cementing these fragments together with paint and overlaying recycled street art stencils, Bradford evokes rich, colorful works that are alive with texture, and teeming with shards of the material world. In his earliest works, Bradford relied heavily on hair papers (used during the process of permanently curling hair), pilfered from his mother’s beauty salon in L.A.

Toyin Ojih Odutola,"As she traces the same shape again and again, Ojih Odutola’s lines become darker and deeper, sometimes pushed to the point where their blackness becomes luminous. Set against a blank white background, as in Untitled (2015), Ojih Odutola’s figures are stark, resolute in their darkness. The surface of her subject’s skin becomes ribbon-like, lines weaving across the contours of their head and neck. The simplicity and starkness of Ojih Odutola’s composition—most often, black on white, sometimes with shots of color woven through the deep black lines—enable a consideration of skin, blackness, surface, and detail, all hovering out of time and space.","Though born in Nigeria, artist Toyin Ojih Odutola was raised largely in the United States, living in Alabama, California, and now New York. Known for her intricate drawings of human heads and figures, Ojih Odutola’s artistic practice is concerned with the representation of race, and the concept of blackness as visual marker and social construct. Her drawings are made through intricately and fastidiously layering black lines—building up a density that Ojih Odutola describes as “black on black on black.” Using pens and markers as her primary media, Ojih Odutola builds textures through sinewy black lines, shot through at times with metallic color.

Maria Taniguchi,"Maria Taniguchi works across several media but is principally known for her long-running series of quasi-abstract paintings featuring a stylized brick wall device. Full of subtle gradations and low-key modulations, these are her trademark: a sustained, reiterative practice, steeped in repetition but carefully attuned to the economies and the sculptural presence of painting. Her approach to painting is conceptual. Her point of departure for the series is individual, subjective time. The unified visual grid of the black monochrome acrylic paintings is based on the simplest repeating pattern in masonry, yet when viewed more closely their stark surfaces veer more towards the personal and poetic: glistening patches of irregular shapes and sizes reveal the limits of a days work.","Throughout her paintings, sculptures, and videos, Maria Taniguchi unpacks knowledge and experience—connecting material culture, technology, and natural evolution—and investigates space and time, along with social and historical contexts. Whether with her quasi-abstract brick paintings or with the moving images of plain and everyday objects, Taniguchi enforces the action of viewing upon our senses. The consequence is the reinterpretation of the objects, and the attainment of sensorial and cognitive experiences.",Untitled,Asia,"['grid.n.01', 'conceptual.s.01', 'repeat.n.01', 'economy.n.01', 'form.n.03', 'sculptural.a.01', 'see.v.05', 'poetic.a.01', 'approach.n.01', 'individual.a.01', 'presence.n.01', 'series.n.01', 'personal.a.01', 'shape.n.01', 'surface.n.01', 'establish.v.08', 'wall.n.01', 'black.a.01', 'medium.n.01', 'practice.n.01', 'ocular.a.02', 'time.n.01']","['repeat.n.01', 'time.n.01', 'form.n.03', 'conceptual.s.01', 'formalism.n.01', 'subjectivity.n.01', 'relativism.n.01', 'experience.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_MT_2015_Untitled_16146_a-WEB.png,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_MT_2015_Untitled_16146_a-WEB-203x300.png,https://kadist.org/work/untitled-maria/,"['Individual_Personal/8.498529411764705', 'Material_Physical/4.076923076923077', 'Cultural/2.6470588235294117']","['Individual_Personal', 'Material_Physical', 'Cultural']",15.222511312217193,"['Mind/5.223529411764705', 'Time/2.5384615384615383', 'Design/1.8235294117647058']","['Mind', 'Time', 'Design']",9.58552036199095,"['Cultural/30.107676619905735', 'Society/20.60707103354163', 'Material_Physical/10.84871794871795']","['Cultural', 'Society', 'Material_Physical']",61.56346560216531,"['Media/9.188251454427924', 'Economy/7.4007326007326', 'Arts/7.30927960927961']","['Media', 'Economy', 'Arts']",23.898263664440133,0.6666666666666666,0.0
Glenn Ligon,"In his 2011 neon work, Untitled (Only Poetry), Ligon borrows a phrase from the Chilean author Roberto Bolaño.

Ligon filters through cultural sources to create compositions that highlight social inequalities, commemorate struggles, and point fingers at hypocrisy.

Aslan Gaisumov,"Gaisumov fled Grozny with his family during the Russian occupation in the early 2000s. This semi-autobiographical video involves a misty field, and Chechnyans (mostly Gaisumov’s own extended family) walking calmly but with purpose toward a car. First one and two at a time, and eventually by the dozen, families climb into the car. It’s both a literal and metaphorical demonstration of the compromising discomforts of departure from one’s homeland, and implicitly refers to the challenges of a proper assessment of the numbers of displaced peoples. The car they travel in, the “Volga”, is a relic of the Soviet era administrative class (the nomenklatura). It’s an icon that recalls the aspirations of a better country, and regional unity, but also a failed attempt. In the US and elsewhere, the scene suggests clowns piling into a tiny car at the circus. This may refer to the humiliation of fleeing, or the fact that the people of the Caucasus have been historically de-humanized by the Russians as inferior.","Young Chechen artist Aslan Gaisumov’s artworks are an opportunity to understand events of his personal life and the recent history of his people. By endowing his war memories with an art form the artist strives to critically and emotionally distance himself from the events of the last two decades and to find an intuitive and poetical language for their description.

The single-channel video Waltz of the Machine Equestrians is a response to the overwhelming number of motorbikes and scooters overtaking the streets of Vietnam as small agrarian communities have been displaced by the construction of skyscrapers. The video shows 28 “equestrians” on motorbikes and scooters arrayed into a rainbow cavalcade held together by strings clipped onto brightly colored ponchos. Wearing helmets, face masks, and sun glasses, the riders attempt to shield themselves from the environment with armors sutured from cheap plastic material. They meander in a procession through a former scenic town near the Saigon River that has become the busy district of Thu Thiem. The precarious turns in the terse choreography is ushered by a soundtrack featuring Dmitri Shostakovich’s histrionic Suite for Variety Orchestra, Waltz no. 2, in which trombones and cymbals echo the increased tensions between the individual and the collective. As the riders break free of each other in a grand finale, the sacrifice of spontaneity in maintaining the mechanical rhythm of such an interdependent enterprise is underscored in light of individual freedom.","Uudam Tran Nguyen born in KonTum Vietnam to an artist family. Although he had lived in the United States for almost two decades, during which he was trained as a figurative sculptor at UCLA and the School of Visual Art in New York, Vietnam remains a central theme in his works. Facile in a variety of media ranging from video, sound and text installations, to guerilla activity, Nguyen engages broad social concerns through using materials with aesthetic appeal.

Luke Murphy,"What Color is Luke Murphy’s outstanding digital painting that elegantly loops in nonstop motion. The artist cleverly usurped the familiar signage of brightly scrolling words that we ordinarily see calling out to advertise a Bodega or sidewalk cart’s fast food. In a DIY manner, Murphy constructed the extra-luminous LED panel screen and also wrote the code that sets the pace and pattern of the flowing words. Murphy plays with his viewers’ routine as “users” who spend countless waking hours on a daily basis staring at a computer screen. In the same way, he regards his viewers as “users” of his art. On the screen of the work, Murphy’s words animate one of the Internet’s oldest memes: in bold letters “ORANGE,” “YELLOW,” “GREEN,” and so on, glide across the display in colors different from those they signify.  Emoticons dance across the composition, as iconic as a Jasper Johns’ flag painting, but with the humor of a broken announcement board on the New York subway. Murphy resolves the tension between painting (as object) and computer screen (as medium), which has plagued digital artists for years.","Luke Murphy is a systems-based artist whose work is loosely bound by common themes of quantifying elements of the psyche and spirit with a particular interest in the Gnostic gospels, religious paintings, and digital languages – codes and systems to make art.  His work of the past few years has been an investigation into the fundamentals of randomness and how it powers digital art, the underlying mechanisms of hope and politics and more broadly our digital age. Seeking the most perfect source of randomness lead him in the past to use radioactive decay, as the engine to generate random numbers that are then harvested to power his art. The sublime unpredictability and profound unknowability of the spontaneous decay of Uranium is translated by his various algorithms into a new sublime, one of information, digital visualization and painting strategies.  Murphy’s work tries to interleave cultural post-atomic anxieties, information culture and the Gnostics’ belief that the world was and is irrational.",What Color,Americas,"['screen.n.01', 'viewing_audience.n.01', 'digital.a.01', 'food.n.01', 'dance.n.01', 'new_york.n.01', 'york.n.01', 'flag.n.01', 'display.n.01', 'familiar.a.01', 'form.n.03', 'iconic.a.01', 'daily.s.01', 'colors.n.01', 'tension.n.01', 'color.n.01', 'composition.n.01', 'artist.n.01', 'medium.n.01', 'manner.n.01', 'object.n.01']","['ad.n.01', 'painterly.s.01', 'digital.a.01', 'anxiety.n.01', 'everyday.s.01', 'banner.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_WhatColor2.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_WhatColor2-248x300.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/murphy-what-color/,"['Society/2.6263736263736264', 'Individual_Personal/2.6263736263736264', 'Politics/2.307692307692308']","['Society', 'Individual_Personal', 'Politics']",7.56043956043956,"['Power/2.307692307692308', 'Emotion/1.8571428571428572', 'Economy/1.0']","['Power', 'Emotion', 'Economy']",5.164835164835165,"['Cultural/22.38089851325146', 'Material_Physical/9.060281548516844', 'Society/5.099865047233469']","['Cultural', 'Material_Physical', 'Society']",36.54104510900177,"['Arts/7.732859297565179', 'Media/6.792647058823529', 'Materiality/4.303418803418804']","['Arts', 'Media', 'Materiality']",18.82892515980751,0.3333333333333333,0.0
Patty Chang,"The video “Shangri-La” refers to the mythical city of James Hilton’s novel “Lost Horizon” written in 1933 and is exemplified in a film by Frank Capra which speaks of eternal youth in a city of happiness. In 1997, a small town in an agricultural region of central China near the Tibetan border was proclaimed as the place that inspired Shangri-la. Thereafter, a dozen other cities in the same area have claimed to be paradise on earth, prompting a marketing battle without mercy, raging on until the government’s intervention. The mirror used to build the model of the mountain is highly symbolic and often appears in the work of the artist. In literature and art, it represents the transition between reality and the dream world composed of projections and desires. Chang’s work focuses on the reality and fiction inherent in an existing space in both its concrete embodiment and its myth. She explores the idea of a real journey to an imaginary place. This work exposes contradictions: the search for a city’s roots and traditions leads to a falsification of its history, and cultural conflicts inside of touristic and financial goals.","When she arrived in New York in the mid 1990s, Patty Chang became involved in the performance scene. Staging her own body in intensely difficult situations enables her to denounce problems she observes in contemporary society such as various excessive behaviors like eating disorders, as well as the sex trade, gender and cultural stereotypes, identity issues. Soon, she also used video and photography (like the Contortion series 2000-2002) to document her actions and extend her practice. By appropriating cinematic conventions, popular culture, pornography, literature and translation, Chang ceaselessly explores and subverts historical and current relations between East and West.

Stéphane Calais,"L’herbier (petit Trianon) consists of four “realistic” drawings of plants, screenprinted on transparent PVC. Relying on drawing as a study, this work resembles many sketchbook drawings of the artist, but also alludes to the series titled “Magnolia”. “The subject is a kind of cultural minimum (the plant) and the herbarium tends to this minimum,” Calais suggests. This work follows the tradition of still life painting, ranging from technical mastery to vanity. The metaphor of the plant as a network and an ornament is recurrent theme in his work as well as arborescent typography, wall painting in the works “Le haricot magique du petit Jack,”(Little Jack’s bean) (1997) as well as sculpture gardens. Evoking a rococo spirit, his drawings surfaces’ shimmer like a glaze, quivering at the slightest breath. One can well imagine that L’Herbier ( the Herbarium) could have taken place in the Petit Trianon at the garden of Versailles, signifying a balance between simplicity and the richness of ornament. In an interview, the artist spoke of this work like a house of cards – everything is visible and transparent, the whole is obvious. Yet, the overlap of the screenprint detailed in a “block sediment” of different sheets alludes (by surprise) to images – the slightly blurred images are not immediate and clear.","From screen-printing to sculpture, as well as painting and installation, Stéphane Calais multiplies the figures of style, underpinned by the lines of drawing, all in playful and sweet world, at times disturbing. All mediums used by the artist, associated intimately with the world of drawing, exist as extensions of the sheet of paper. His series of “sculpture collage” titled “Ornement, crime et délice” illustrate his interest in the density and variety of styles and materials: nets hanging from the ceiling supporting basketballs, plants, feathers, etc. Decoration is not incidental, but is a dynamic network internal to his works. Collage is “a way to settle the real” as the artist suggests and “to cross temporalities, always on the mode of the diverse.” While some violence is present between the lines, like all tales, his work contains two levels of reading. For example, Calais is fascinated by the work and the tragic fate of Bruno Schulz, a Polish-Jewish writer and artist, who “is one of the designers of fantasy, this great line that forges a truly global world” as depicted in the installation “La chambre de Schultz” (2007-2008).

Matthew Buckingham,"Matthew Buckingham presents a narrative directly connected with a highly symbolic site in the United States, the Mount Rushmore Memorial*. He elaborates a historiographic narrative of this place and switches it into the domain of science fiction by proposing a photograph of the Memorial as it should appear in 500 000 years. The effigies of Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln and Roosevelt become unrecognizable. In the texts, deployed in a chronological order, we learn, among other things, that the sculptor Gutzon Borglum was a member of the Ku Klux Klan.Buckingham tells real and fictional stories to test their validity and exemplarity in the present. The installation, featuring the image of the Memorial, can lead us to reflect on our role in writing new chapters of this history.     * The Memorial is located in South Dakota in the United States, it is an 18 meters high monumental granite sculpture initiated in 1925, representing four of the most significant presidents in American history.","Matthew Buckingham was born in 1963 in the United States of America. He has recently had solo exhibitions at the Art Institute of Chicago and at the Reina Sofia in Madrid. His critical approach reenacts real or fictional stories while interrogating their validity in order to clarify the present. He considers the construction of collective memory and individual memory. He asks how these memories can be diametrically opposed to the writing of History with a capital H dependent on the Modernist ideology of progress. Several of his works are linked to the exploration of the lives of significant individuals, such as important figureheads for Feminism. His work relates to the questions posed as a consequence of Cultural Studies in the 1970s, of Queer and Feminist theories as well as Postcolonial studies. In his articulation of reality and fiction, he is close to works which are already in the collection by Mario Garcia Torres or by Walid Raad.","The six grandfathers, Paha Sapa, in the year 502 002",Americas,"['narrative.n.01', 'history.n.01', 'fictional.a.01', 'locate.v.01', 'symbolic.a.01', 'fiction.n.01', 'south.n.01', 'american.a.01', 'narrative.s.01', 'real.a.01', 'function.n.03', 'sculpture.n.01', 'photograph.n.01', 'image.n.01']","['erosion.n.01', 'rushmore.n.01', 'prefiguration.n.02', 'ethnography.n.01', 'context.n.01', 'sioux.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/img-692.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/img-692-217x300.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/the-six-grandfathers-paha-sapa-in-the-year-502-002/,"['Cultural/3.356390977443609', 'Individual_Personal/2.3927601809954755', 'Material_Physical/2.3238095238095235']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Material_Physical']",8.072960682248608,"['History/1.8181818181818181', 'Mind/1.6235294117647059', 'Language/1.561904761904762']","['History', 'Mind', 'Language']",5.0036159918512855,"['Cultural/22.915362905068793', 'Material_Physical/10.623132423132423', 'Individual_Personal/5.70552503052503']","['Cultural', 'Material_Physical', 'Individual_Personal']",39.244020358726246,"['Fantasy/8.200757575757576', 'Arts/7.356435394670688', 'Land/7.199755799755799']","['Fantasy', 'Arts', 'Land']",22.756948770184064,1.0,0.0
Elina Brotherus,"A subject’s back stands before a landscape of mountains, arid and majestic, Der Wanderer 3 revisits the theme of man versus nature dear to Romantic painting and the paintings of Caspar David Friedrich in particular. “From him I returned to the theme of the character turning their backs to the viewer. I love the back. The back is quiet, discreet, polite and distant. It does not challenge the viewer as the eye does, the viewer looks at the same landscape as the model, but they are not disturbed.” With the series “The New Painting” made between 2000 and 2004, Brotherus confronts the photographic medium to the codes of classical painting, its subjects and aesthetics, particularly those of the landscape and the use of the nude.","Elina Brotherus depicts, through her photographic work a portrait of the contemporary artist made during different artistic residencies. Frequently in her work, she is the main model. In the series of “Suites françaises”  (French suites) made during a residency of three months at the Musée Nicéphore Niepce at Chalon-sur-Saône in 1999, the artist questions her relation to a foreign language, showing the difficulty in naming things with “post it” stickies. From this work emerges a sense of autobiographical intimacy, of which the camera exists as an absent witness. The artist captures decisive emotional states: the skin texture of a dancer in rehersal, a fine arts model posing as a Degas nude, a state of mind before leaving…The theme of landscape links introspection and contemplation as revealed in her self-portaits. One thinks of Caspar David Friedrich who stressed in his paintings that art played a role as mediator between nature and man. When referring to her work  Brotherus has stated, “For me, photography is primarily a constructed image. I consider myself a “maker” of images, or perhaps as someone who finds images. Visual discovery is very important. The working process follows after in the lab.”Elina Brotherus was born in 1972 in Helsinki, Finland.

Olaf Breuning,"In the work We only move wehen something changes !!!, Olaf Breuning composes a portrait of posed antiglobalization protesters, each wearing clown noses, inside of a scene reminiscent of an event. Like in the work Easter Bunnies (2004) (photographs of the Moai of Easter Island with big ears and rabbit teeth supported by scaffolding) the artist introduces the outside frame into his photographic frame. The detail of the red noses, that punctuate the image, re-examine the photograph’s meaning by introducing the role of the absurd inside of contemporary global issues. At once critical and playful, Breuning doesn’t alienate his subjects. The young anti-globalization activists are not impaired. Instead, they are shot or snapped in a moment of confusion, which is equally shared by Olaf Breuning himself. The spelling mistake of ‘when’ creates a supplementary text of a subtext. “Wehen” in German signifies the act of floating in the wind and the pains of childbirth. A linguistic slip surprisingly in tune with the subject of the image, the photograph evokes youth’s generational gap torn between the uncertainties and desires of action.","Olaf Breuning’s photographs, videos, performances and installations play with codes of mass production with references to publicity, fashion and cinema and “high” and “low” art. Between fiction and reality, fairytales and triviality, nightmare and bad jokes, the artist immerses his viewers decidedly into a pop and kitsch culture which is constantly being revisited.

Mohamed Bourouissa,"The film called Temps Mort (Dead Time or Time Out) presents an exchange of short video footage assembled into one final edit. Remotely driven footage of daily life in prison, the banality of a sink, of a plant or a plate of pasta are offtset against scenes of life outside, in the streets of Paris, a night of love or seascapes. The dialogue between the inmate and the artist occurs by text messages and captures this exceptional situation of exchange, sharing et perhaps dependence. As the tie between the two men develops, the confrontation between life inside and out of those walls intensifies. Like his previous work, it is interesting to compare this with the documentaries screened in the general media about violence in the suburbs or in prisons.","Mohamed Bourouissa studied at the Arts Décoratifs in Paris and then at the Fresnoy.

Barbara Bloom,"In the 1980’s, while browsing Parisian fleamarkets, Barbara Bloom stumbled into an anonymous watercolor (dating to around 1960) in one of Paris’ fleamarkets, probably a study made by an interior designer for a bedroom. The artist found the image to be typically Parisian. The watercolor, framed under a mat made of cardboard, had color tests on its margin, elements that Bloom discovered when she raised it. These details caught her attention and inspired her to create the installation titled The Bedroom. The work presents several elements related to image: a reproduction of the study, a reproduction of another watercolor contained in the set, and a carpet showing the floor of the depicted room (a detail of the carpet under the bed, and a shadow of the chair represented), as well as dabs of paint also present on the edges of the study. The two prints are hung on the wall, painted in light yellow, like the color of the walls in the study. On the floor, the carpet adds a final touch to the domestic aspect of the installation, also existing as a quasi-abstract expressionist painting. The installation plays upon different levels – the perspective effect on the carpet, aquarelle tests from the margin of the study, as well as “real” elements, each becoming decorative patterns for the piece at large.","Collector Barbara Bloom mixes autobiographical details, fictional narratives, and literary quotes. She arranges images and objects, and at the same time she makes transparent fetishitic qualitites which bind her to her objects and installations. The series entitled “Broken Objects” (2001) features celadon-colored porcelain broken by the artist then “repaired” with gold, according to an ancient Japanese technique. Fractures in the porcelain reveal the object’s fragility and imperfection. Like a precious scar, the porcelain’s fracture tells it’s story. The artist compares herself to a detective who unleashes meaning inside of small details. Bloom belongs to the generation of post-modern artists such as Cindy Shermann, Barbara Kruger, Richard Prince, etc. who analyze visual culture and expose its underlying ideologies. Although her practice is conceptual, it is based on objects that she likes or intrigue her. Through her decorative arrangements she refers to museography and the history of museums (the use of vitrines, wall text, name placards, lighting, etc.) and the way the eye operates inside of this context. Her interest in the question of perception is not only related to the visible and its limits, but also to representation, with particular regard to women’s place in history, which explains why she plays with sentimentality, femininity and elegance in some of her objects. Bloom was Jason Dodge’s professor with whom she shares a sense of metonymy: anecdotes of universal dimensions, the object as a trace, as well as memory and vanity.Barbara Bloom was born in 1951 in Los Angeles.

ATLAS GROUP / Walid Raad,"This image is an extract from a notebook in the archives of doctor Fakhouri that lists the cars that have been used for bombs between 1975 and 1991. Each page of the notebook contains a collage of an image of a car with the same make, model and color as the exploded car with a text in Arabic that gives the details of the place, time and date of the explosion, the number of people in the accident, the perimeter of destruction, the weight and the type of explosive. The images of the cars made visible are only equivalents since the cars that actually exploded are totally destroyed. Doctor Fakhouri made reconstitutions while the information collected in the media itself is subject to interpretation. The composition of these images in space is another distancing from the real fact. It is a little known fact that Lebanese historians were also gamblers during the war. They met every Sunday at the race courses. Race after race, the historians were positioned behind the press photographers who were there to take a picture of the winning horse passing the finishing line. The historians betted on how many fractions of seconds before or after passing the line the photograph would be taken. That is to say that no photo showed the horse on the finishing line. Each page of the notebook contains an image of the horse passing the finish line cut out of the Annahar newspaper on the following day. It features the annotations of doctor Fakhouri on the length and duration of the race, on the winning horse and his timing, his average speed, the initials of the different historians and their bets, the time between the snapshot and the passage of the finishing line, a very brief description of the winning historian (here the linguist). These documents provoke questions about historical fact. Why are there no images of the precise moment when the horse passes the finishing line? Does the press authorize the reproduction of false information? Conscious of the impossibility of capturing the exact moment, the historians bet not on the horses but on the photographer’s margin of error. The evidence about an event is not necessarily linked to the production of an objective document. There can be no certain objectivity with photographic material.","The Atlas Group is a project established in Beirut in 1999 to research and document the contemporary history of Lebanon.

Carey Young,"Report of the Legal Subcommittee is a print featuring a map of the stars, together with a found transcription of a recent United Nations meeting in which various international delegations declare frustration with their 40-year-old, ongoing efforts to devise a legal definition of outer space. This admission seems to hold a rich poetic potential, the human attempts to bureaucratize and control outer space seemingly frustrated by the sublime scale and mystery of its infinite depths.","Carey Young’s (b. Lusaka, Zambia, 1970) practice centers on the ethics of business and legal practice, motivated from having spent her early professional career in this context, to question society and politics. Young parodies and analyses the corporate business and legal world to expose its influence on contemporary society. The subject of law —that which is central to the structure of the international community — is a subject rarely explored in the contemporary art milieu. In exploring law as an artistic medium to address questions of the sublime and the void, Young traverses themes of the autonomous body, law and fiction and the power of law on society to highlight the danger of corporate influence in the institute and autonomous thinking.",Report of the Legal Subcommittee,Europe,"['attempt.n.01', 'star.n.01', 'map.n.01', 'keep.v.01', 'space.n.01', 'poetic.a.01', 'scale.n.01', 'human.a.01']","['outer_space.n.01', 'constellation.n.02', 'systematize.v.01', 'capitalism.n.01', 'frustration.n.01', 'futility.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/cy-43-prt.jpeg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/cy-43-prt-239x300.jpeg,https://kadist.org/work/report-of-the-legal-subcommittee/,"['Material_Physical/9.684615384615386', 'Society/1.8333333333333335', 'Individual_Personal/0.8333333333333334']","['Material_Physical', 'Society', 'Individual_Personal']",12.351282051282054,"['Space/8.146153846153846', 'Economy/1.8333333333333335', 'Body/0.8333333333333334']","['Space', 'Economy', 'Body']",10.812820512820513,"['Cultural/10.708139409609998', 'Material_Physical/10.512332112332114', 'Society/7.2835164835164825']","['Cultural', 'Material_Physical', 'Society']",28.503988005458595,"['Space/8.712332112332112', 'Arts/3.2750000000000004', 'Spirituality/3.257142857142857']","['Space', 'Arts', 'Spirituality']",15.244474969474968,0.6666666666666666,0.3333333333333333
Leung Chi Wo and Wong Sara,"Photojournalist with Two Cameras restages a portrait of a photojournalist from the background of an old photograph of protest published in South China Morning Post on January 10, 2010 under the headline “Return of the Radicals: Recent angry protests are nothing new.” The photojournalist in the photograph, probably from a protest of earlier decades, was capturing the scene of a protester’s arrest while wearing two cameras. January of 2010 was a time of pro-Democracy demonstrators called for the release of activist Liu Xiaobo, drafter of the Charter 08 manifesto calling for the end of authoritarian rule, was sentenced to 11 years in prison one month earlier. Leung’s isolating and highlighting of the photographer by bringing him from the original photograph’s background to the foreground of his studio shot calls attention to the two older cameras and the journalist’s retro-style clothing. This focus brings forth the multiplicity of gazes present in photojournalism and its implications for free speech and freedom of press across the geopolitical history of Hong Kong.","Leung Chi Wo tends to highlight in his art the boundaries between viewing and voyeurism, real and fictional, and art and the everyday. Leung is generally concerned with aspects of photography that are not strictly visual and often considers the local population and sites in his photographic installations to reflect a deeper critical engagement with globalization and global consumerism. Working often with pinhole photography and mixed media while exploring cityscapes, Leung focuses on the emotional expressions of the urban man through figural portraiture. Specifically, his photography captures the identity and politics of Hong Kong after its return to China in relation to his photographed subjects.",Photojournalist With Two Cameras,Asia,"['protest.n.01', 'camera.n.01', 'background.n.01', 'photograph.n.01', 'prison.n.01', 'address.n.03', 'rule.n.01', 'militant.n.01', 'print.v.01', 'china.n.01', 'photographer.n.01', 'studio.n.01', 'south.n.01', 'attention.n.01', 'shooting.n.01', 'original.s.01', 'portrayal.n.01', 'scene.n.01', 'history.n.01', 'time.n.01']","['reenactment.n.01', 'photojournalism.n.01', 'protest.n.03', 'china.n.01', 'dictatorship.n.01', 'foreground.v.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/leung_chi_wo_and_sara_wong_photojournalist_with_two_cameras_web.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/leung_chi_wo_and_sara_wong_photojournalist_with_two_cameras_web-200x300.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/photojournalist-with-two-cameras/,"['Cultural/12.872819303159861', 'Politics/6.044230769230769', 'Society/4.7651903651903655']","['Cultural', 'Politics', 'Society']",23.682240437580994,"['Arts/5.56750208855472', 'Media/4.965634674922601', 'Land/2.6198830409356724']","['Arts', 'Media', 'Land']",13.153019804412994,"['Material_Physical/18.068254277542213', 'Cultural/8.9100930115636', 'Individual_Personal/6.8242063492063485']","['Material_Physical', 'Cultural', 'Individual_Personal']",33.80255363831216,"['Land/11.349553370606003', 'Activism/4.275', 'Time/3.3354645354645354']","['Land', 'Activism', 'Time']",18.96001790607054,0.3333333333333333,0.3333333333333333

Through his public installations, workshops, and commissions, he tries to reinforce the interest in and analysis of technology in artistic production and theory, with hopes to build cross-connections between art and technology in Indonesia.",Men from Hyperion and Women from Phoebe (ver 0.3),Asia,"['pair.n.01', 'feature.n.01', 'degree.n.01', 'interpretation.n.01', 'produce.v.01', 'sound.n.01', 'surface.n.01', 'woman.n.01', 'practice.n.01', 'form.n.01']","['experiment.n.02', 'acoustics.n.01', 'gender.n.01', 'technology.n.01', 'connection.n.01', 'misuse.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/guitar_by_venzha_web.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/guitar_by_venzha_web-300x225.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/men-from-hyperion-and-women-from-phoebe-ver-0-3/,"['Cultural/9.979640277163496', 'Material_Physical/5.846677959721438', 'Politics/4.116711229946524']","['Cultural', 'Material_Physical', 'Politics']",19.943029466831458,"['Technology/3.5656346749226002', 'Physics/3.4103143233578015', 'Arts/1.7124183006535947']","['Technology', 'Physics', 'Arts']",8.688367298933995,"['Cultural/17.709798534798544', 'Society/14.866045392515984', 'Individual_Personal/11.359793148028446']","['Cultural', 'Society', 'Individual_Personal']",43.935637075342974,"['Culture/4.973168498168498', 'Media/4.118681318681318', 'Economy/4.028937728937729']","['Culture', 'Media', 'Economy']",13.120787545787545,0.3333333333333333,0.0
Sora Kim,"Turtle Walk is a video installation that documents two performers carrying large white disks on their backs as they walk through the urban environment of Seoul. The simple disks disrupt normal social behaviors in urban space, acting like parabolic antennae that cause the performers to interact and communicate unusually with their surroundings. The performance causes viewers to reflect on their expectations for normal behaviors within the social space of the city. The video appeared as part of Citydance, co-presented by Kadist and CCA Wattis, a series of screenings that asked, “How does our movement as individuals or groups shape the urban imaginary?”","Sora Kim’s work often involves procedures of gift-giving, spontaneous social interactions, and the role of numbers in our personal lives. She frequently collaborates with socially dispossessed people or engages the participation of her viewers.

Taiyo Kimura,"Haunted by You documents Taiyo Kimura’s struggle to use a record player, satirizing the normal actions of everyday life in order to question the meanings that underlie ordinary modes of living. The performance narrative unfolds upon the circular movements of the turntable. A chicken’s leg replaces the turntable’s arm. The artist places a watermelon on the revolving record and attempts to slice it with a knife attached to his faces. He throws an octopus onto the vinyl. Finally, he ties a noose around his neck and allows it to tighten with each rotation of the turntable. Ordinary objects, motions, and actions become absurd and humorous, challenging viewers’ unconscious approaches to daily life.","Taiyo Kimura works with sculpture, video, and installation and uses everyday objects, humor, and music to questions the meaning of ordinary life.

Gao Mingyan,"In City Golf (2008) the artist Gao Mingyan films himself playing 18 “holes” of golf throughout the mega-city of Shanghai. For each hole, Gao traveled to significant places from his memory – his first school, his childhood playground, and his former date hangouts – and proceeded to play a makeshift round of golf at each location. In revisiting locales from his youth, Gao attempts to forge a linear connection between all the important places that comprise a life’s experience, his performative “passing” through each location poetically referencing his own passage through time. Gao’s project, however, raises deeper questions about transgression. In order to construct these temporary “holes,” Gao has to willing subvert how these locations function as public site, a significant intervention of private will into a communal space in a country, China, where the tensions between private/public are decidedly political.","Gao Mingyan produces video based-works that examine the political and epistemological violence of our contemporary moment. While his work may seem to document the everyday and mundane, he is decidedly interested in how the dissemination of popular media affects our perception of social tensions and anxieties. His practice stems from the belief that our contemporary moment is defined by a constant state of warfare in which epistemological forms of political and economic warfare inflict as much harm as live ammunition.

Jakrawal Nilthamrong,"The film Man and Gravity follows the journey of a man in an old, beaten motorcycle, struggling to transport his possessions through a mountainous landscape. At times riding swiftly and at times caught in a bind, we witness the man fighting against gravity and the roughness and irregularity of the terrain. The film draws on the artist’s own Buddhist beliefs, referencing the writings of ascetic Thai philosopher Buddhadasa Bhikkhu, who uses the concept of gravity as a metaphor for karma and destiny. The man’s attempt to win over gravity, pushing and maneuvering in and out of ditches while holding the weight of his possessions, speaks of the invisible forces we must all work against, and symbolizes the struggle to fulfil his (and our own) destiny.","Jakrawal Nilthamrong is a Bangkok based artist and filmmaker who came to prominence for his unconventional approach to filmmaking. From short films and documentary to video installations and feature films, his works often incorporate concepts from Eastern philosophy, which acquire new meanings when revisited in a contemporary context. Influenced by surrealist figures such as Salvador Dalí and Luis Buñuel, Nilthamrong’s films are characterized by their enigmatic nature, lack of a linear narrative, and their use of the non-sequitur. Some of the recurring themes in his work include karma, reincarnation and destiny, drawing on his own beliefs as a practicing Buddhist in order to explore painful events in Thailand’s history and their resulting trauma. The results are perplexing and complex films that follow their own internal logic and defy easy interpretation, slipping between past and present, the real and the imagined.",Man and Gravity,Asia,"['times.n.01', 'force.n.01', 'struggle.n.01', 'invisible.a.01', 'movie.n.01', 'journey.n.01', 'concept.n.01', 'metaphor.n.01', 'attempt.n.01', 'landscape.n.01']","['physical.s.04', 'struggle.n.03', 'gravity.n.01', 'karma.n.01', 'destiny.n.02', 'buddhism.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/man_and_gravity_1_web.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/man_and_gravity_1_web-300x201.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/man-and-gravity/,"['Material_Physical/3.427350427350427', 'Individual_Personal/2.8666666666666667', 'Society/0.8888888888888888']","['Material_Physical', 'Individual_Personal', 'Society']",7.182905982905982,"['Spirituality/2.8666666666666667', 'Physics/2.658119658119658', 'Economy/0.8888888888888888']","['Spirituality', 'Physics', 'Economy']",6.413675213675214,"['Cultural/19.73812037635568', 'Individual_Personal/15.6960927960928', 'Society/11.55310712679134']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Society']",46.98732029923982,"['Media/6.554151404151405', 'Spirituality/4.826373626373626', 'Culture/4.764835164835165']","['Media', 'Spirituality', 'Culture']",16.145360195360198,0.6666666666666666,0.3333333333333333
Robert Zhao Renhui,"Changi, Singapore, possibly 1970s is from the series “As We Walked on Water” (2010-2012), which looks into Singapore’s history around the phenomenon of land reclamation. After exhausting the country’s own soil from its tiny hills and ridges, the government had to buy sand from Malaysia and Indonesia to continue its reclamation efforts. At the early stages of a land reclamation project, the imported sand would sit idle for some time, forming an artificial desert-like landscape. By fictionally representing these landscapes, Zhao’s image fluctuates between history and story making, echoing the equally undermined condition of the man-made nature of our landscapes as they gradually become part of the real environment.","Robert Zhao Renhui’s photographic prints question fact-based presentations of conservation and highlight the manner through which documentary, journalistic, or scientific reports sensationalize nature in order to elicit viewer sympathy. Zhao portrays human as figures curious about their natural environment, which is at times mysterious and unpredictable. Through observing human behavior in front of animals rather than that of the animals themselves, Zhao’s critical lens examines various modes of what he calls a “zoological gaze,” the manner through which humans view animals and nature. His works create visual ambiguity so the viewer becomes aware of assumptions made about the way images present facts. Zhao received a Bachelor of Fine Arts in photography at Caberwell College of Arts and a Masters degree at the London College of Communication, where he graduated with distinction.","Changi, Singapore, possibly 1970s",Asia,"['land.n.01', 'landscape.n.01', 'phenomenon.n.01', 'history.n.01', 'phase.n.01', 'water.n.01', 'government.n.01', 'environment.n.01', 'attempt.n.01', 'real.a.01', 'state.n.04', 'nature.n.01', 'undertaking.n.01', 'narrative.n.01', 'time.n.01', 'series.n.01', 'image.n.01']","['land.n.01', 'property.n.01', 'reclamation.n.01', 'landscape.n.01', 'conservation.n.01', 'environment.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/changi_singapore_possibly_1970s_web.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/changi_singapore_possibly_1970s_web-300x200.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/changi-singapore-possibly-1970s/,"['Material_Physical/11.272827172827174', 'Society/1.8055555555555554', 'Individual_Personal/0.9230769230769231']","['Material_Physical', 'Society', 'Individual_Personal']",14.001459651459653,"['Land/8.74975024975025', 'Urbanization/1.8055555555555554', 'Familial/0.9230769230769231']","['Land', 'Urbanization', 'Familial']",11.478382728382728,"['Material_Physical/19.749383949383954', 'Individual_Personal/17.842471563524203', 'Cultural/13.992607392607395']","['Material_Physical', 'Individual_Personal', 'Cultural']",51.58446290551555,"['Time/7.459274059274058', 'Land/7.34065934065934', 'Familial/5.718681318681319']","['Time', 'Land', 'Familial']",20.518614718614717,0.6666666666666666,0.6666666666666666
Camel Collective,"Something Other Than What You Are is formed by two works: a multi-channel video installation with controlled lighting, and a single channel version with stereo sound. In both works, the 36-minute video depicts a narrative taking place outside a live theater performance in the form of monologues that moves between the production and technical crew. There is a set of three different characters— a lighting technician, a lighting designer, and a professor all played by the same actress who share in their personal experiences and attitudes the precariousness of their work, the problems and myths of collaboration, and the obsolescence of theatrical technology. Across the soliloquies, light becomes a subject and metaphor for the production of visibility and invisibility in the creative field of theater. Something Other Than What You Are, by Camel Collective,  was shot in REDCAT’s theater, using the theater both as a fictional setting as well as subject of study. It was presented in 2015 as part of the first solo exhibition of the group in the United States, curated by Ruth Estevez at REDCAT gallery.","Camel Collective comprises the artists Carla Herrera-Prats (Mexican, photographer and conceptual artist) and Anthony Graves (American, painter), who began working together in 2005 during a fellowship at the Whitney Independent Program. However, the origins and evolution of the collective has drastically changed over the last decade. First, it was a larger research and discursive group organized to question ideas around labor, affect, and collectivity. At the time, in the context of the Bush administration and the Iraq War, the group was primed with artists, along with a few architects, writers and curators developing their careers in political discourse and cultural opposition. Mapping a unique artistic trajectory, their agenda also interrogated the history of artist collaboration, and sought out projects to support artist’s rights and potential unionization of artists. It wasn’t until 2010 the group condensed to only Herrera-Prats and Graves, who have focused their individual practices under Camel Collective to address the problems of contemporary work and collaboration through performance, video, sculpture, and photography.",Something Other Than What You Are,Americas,"['theater.n.01', 'production.n.01', 'subject.n.01', 'field.n.01', 'shoot.v.01', 'form.v.01', 'fictional.a.01', 'setting.n.01', 'creative.a.01', 'version.n.01', 'collaboration.n.01', 'light.a.01', 'survey.n.01', 'technology.n.01', 'video.n.01', 'metaphor.n.01', 'set.n.01', 'individual.a.01', 'narrative.s.01', 'sound.n.01', 'personal.a.01', 'performance.n.01', 'experience.n.01', 'form.n.01']","['theater.n.01', 'obsolescence.n.01', 'value.n.02', 'narrative.n.01', 'labor.n.02', 'performance.n.02']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Camel-Collective_Something-Other-Than-What-You-Are-Still-01.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Camel-Collective_Something-Other-Than-What-You-Are-Still-01-300x168.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/something-other-than-what-you-are/,"['Cultural/7.167372642837039', 'Society/4.2', 'Individual_Personal/3.233333333333334']","['Cultural', 'Society', 'Individual_Personal']",14.600705976170374,"['Arts/2.8161764705882355', 'Fantasy/1.9090909090909092', 'Economy/1.8']","['Arts', 'Fantasy', 'Economy']",6.5252673796791445,"['Cultural/20.4950172376643', 'Politics/10.203749191984487', 'Society/7.04746103569633']","['Cultural', 'Politics', 'Society']",37.746227465345115,"['Arts/8.012111254758313', 'Land/4.075', 'Culture/4.0']","['Arts', 'Land', 'Culture']",16.087111254758312,0.6666666666666666,0.3333333333333333
Emilija Škarnulyte,"In the video, the artist follows her grandmother, Aldona, during her daily walk through the Grutas Park in Lithuania. Founded ten years after the collapse of USSR, this privately-owned sculpture park features close to a hundred Soviet-era statues collected from all over the country. As similar statues were often taken down or destroyed in neighboring Soviet countries, the sculpture park became a unique yet controversial resource. Avoiding both museumification and destruction, the park offers an alternative destination for markers of a painful past. In the video, viewers witness Aldona groping for these monuments along the leafy forest road and gently caressing their surfaces to feel their cracks and comprehend their scale. With the statues no longer occupying places of prominence in city centers, Škarnulyt? highlights their accessibility as Aldona interacts with them by running her hands across their surfaces. Aldona is revealed to be visually impaired, so holding, patting, and touching the monuments with her hands becomes her process of uncovering and comprehending the past through its physicality. In the spring of 1986, the nerves of Aldona’s eyes were poisoned, probably due to the Chernobyl Nuclear Plant explosion. The work reveals the importance of tactile and physical experiences of history, expanding cultural knowledge beyond visual manifestations, while addressing the complicated status of public monuments in regards to the histories they commemorate. Aldona is a highly personal work for the artist whose grandmother was very instrumental to her development as an artist.","Intertwining fiction with documentary, Emilija Škarnulyt?’s videos and multimedia installations explore the psychological power that our environment holds over us, taking an anthropocentric view through the lens of her camera. Focusing on the invisible relations between the physical world and our social imaginary, her films have looked into geological ungrounding processes, for example the concept of geologic time and its influence on our relation with history; invisible architectures, such as the way violent conflicts inscribe themselves in the earth’s structure and vice versa, as well as larger systems of power.

Judith Hopf,"Hopf’s works reference the effects that developments in economics and technology have had on our bodily and mental composition. With her series Laptop Men she presents a humorous reading of the way we interact with computers, and the growing tendency to perceive them as part of our bodies. This takes place against a backdrop of an increasing dependence on implants and prostheses among the human species. We instantly recognize ourselves in the standing or lying steel sculptures resembling thin stickmen, these Laptop Men are perhaps in the process of checking their Facebook account or streaming their favorite series. According to Hopf, these figures were developed with a nod to Modernist sculptures, all while studying the gestures attached to laptops or iPads observed in transit zones such as airports, or other spaces where people have to wait. We try to overcome time with laptops, developing a particular body language in public where the laptop becomes part of the body. The work avoids being too moralistic about a particular idea, attempting instead to deal with the animation of abstract form, feeding it back through a body where electronic tools are already integrated in it.","In her sculptures, installations and videos, German artist Judith Hopf transforms everyday settings and humble materials into comic expressions of humanist values, verging on the absurd. With an understated concision characteristic of her practice, the artist herself describes her working method as an attempt to do something “that doesn’t put me in a bad mood.” Claude Lévi-Strauss’s concept of bricolage resonates not only with Hopf’s formal approach but also in conceptual terms, in the way her works are open to new connections based on their changing context. Resonating with and embodying all the things experienced in a society of overstretching, burnout and chronic exhaustion, Hopf creates sculptures, furniture and absurdist films. She uses humor and wit to address the politics of art making, group dynamics, and the impact of technology on perception and human experience.",Untitled (Laptop Men 4),Europe,"['body.n.01', 'sculpture.n.01', 'reading.n.01', 'animation.n.01', 'backdrop.n.01', 'tool.n.01', 'development.n.01', 'effects.n.01', 'technology.n.01', 'abstract.a.01', 'gesture.n.01', 'language.n.01', 'series.n.01', 'composition.n.01', 'public.a.01', 'idea.n.01', 'human.a.01', 'figure.n.01', 'procedure.n.01', 'people.n.01', 'space.n.01', 'form.n.01', 'time.n.01']","['economy.n.01', 'technology.n.01', 'computer.n.01', 'body.n.01', 'medium.n.03', 'motion.n.03']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/3_JH119_Judith-Hopf_Untitled-Laptop-Man-4_2018.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/3_JH119_Judith-Hopf_Untitled-Laptop-Man-4_2018-200x300.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/untitled-laptop-men-4/,"['Cultural/13.948394742512392', 'Material_Physical/10.395726495726496', 'Society/5.8705379587732525']","['Cultural', 'Material_Physical', 'Society']",30.21465919701214,"['Technology/7.254449472096532', 'Space/7.146153846153846', 'Economy/3.4260935143288087']","['Technology', 'Space', 'Economy']",17.826696832579188,"['Cultural/28.12983731954321', 'Individual_Personal/23.55008977950155', 'Material_Physical/20.936502549737853']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Material_Physical']",72.61642964878261,"['Arts/9.802400703871292', 'Space/7.235042735042734', 'Mind/5.907692307692307']","['Arts', 'Space', 'Mind']",22.945135746606333,0.6666666666666666,0.3333333333333333
Yuri Ancarani,"The Wedding is a silent film, a probing observation of marriage rituals in Qatar in which we soon notice that there is not a single woman visible. The film is part of the broader project The Challenge through which the artist depicts the boredom and rituals endured by young Qatari men throughout various forms of costly and codified entertainment, including the highly theatrical practices of falcon hunting or car racing. The strange, almost surreal, choreography set against an artificial, overexposed backdrop, highlights the privileged presence of men in this part of the world, grouped together by sex and social class. Isolated from the rest of the world, a large tent becomes the theatrical stage. Within this paradigm, silence operates to put the spectator directly in relation with what they see without a mediating discourse.","Yuri Ancarani’s films are quasi-hypnotic devices; following highly unique bodily and site-specific choreographies, drawing sensitive portraits of human relations. Having been awarded numerous prizes in various festivals, the artist is renowned in both the visual art and the documentary film scenes, His preferred mode of presentation is to show his films in gallery spaces, where spectators can experience the physical presence of the images in different ways. Ancarani works without a precise script, choosing instead a process that favors an experiential depiction of the subject and location, and the creative use of film production techniques. There is not necessarily a discernable narrative in his work, but rather compositions of images or sequences that might be isolated from one another in a discontinuous way without disrupting the coherence of the film. Central characters are often loci for an analysis of certain types of masculinity. The director selects moments in which the expressiveness of the body highlights the rituals through which such behaviors are perpetuated.",The Wedding,Europe,"['discourse.n.01', 'backdrop.n.01', 'movie.n.01', 'phase.n.01', 'class.n.01', 'put.v.01', 'relation.n.01', 'visible.a.01', 'individual.a.01', 'presence.n.01', 'woman.n.01', 'practice.n.01', 'undertaking.n.01', 'spectator.n.01', 'social.a.01', 'form.n.01']","['marriage.n.01', 'ritual.n.01', 'culture.n.01', 'sex.n.04', 'ceremony.n.01', 'man.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/capture-vidéo-3.png,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/capture-vidéo-3-300x169.png,https://kadist.org/work/the-wedding-2/,"['Society/4.333927510398098', 'Individual_Personal/2.0', 'Cultural/1.8235294117647058']","['Society', 'Individual_Personal', 'Cultural']",8.157456922162805,"['Culture/1.8235294117647058', 'History/1.8235294117647058', 'Body/1.0']","['Culture', 'History', 'Body']",4.647058823529411,"['Society/18.51686956834016', 'Cultural/17.447308410543705', 'Individual_Personal/14.535878156930792']","['Society', 'Cultural', 'Individual_Personal']",50.50005613581466,"['Media/6.608450046685341', 'Spirituality/5.659706959706959', 'Community/5.14065934065934']","['Media', 'Spirituality', 'Community']",17.40881634705164,1.0,0.0
Andrew Ekins,"Butter Mountain is part of an ongoing series of works that combines a sense of painterly mass and substance with sculptural language to examine the synergy between a topographical landscape and a landscape of the human condition. The work intentionally alludes to the materiality of the human body and of the land. A stool has been consciously repurposed as a “support”, that by its nature and identity provides evidence of human presence. Paint skins are harvested from tins of domestic and industrial or art paints. These are piled, stacked and manipulated to shape a crumpled fleshy landscape, mirroring the grime of human presence and the materiality of a body of land. The title of this work refers to the name given to an extraordinary bulk of “food-waste” created by a period of blinkered EEC political management of food production, which led to the infamous confrontation between Bob Geldof and Margret Thatcher drawing attention to the issue. These works are formed over time and bear the marks of time in their appearance. The sagging, misshapen form is intended to carry some of the narrative of the work. Themes of mortality and decay, growth and renewal are asserted and cloaked by a corrupted decorative structure surfacing through the substance of the paint. Ekins is interested in developing a confection of degraded beauty, a fugitive relationship between the sublime, the abject, and a contemporary perception of beauty.","Andrew Ekins’ work frequently deals with waste and recycling, using discarded materials to make something new. This in itself is not unusual, but the fact that he uses discarded paint, finishing up ends of cans, as well as discarded furniture differentiates him from other similar artists, for the work becomes a self-reflexive process. He is interested not simply in the alchemical side of this practice, but in the way in which things can slide in entropy, forming their own shapes determined by gravity. Paint becomes a malleable substance in his work, a sculptural material at the same time as a painterly one, dealing with themes related to human existence and abjection.",Butter Mountain,Europe,"['paint.n.01', 'human.a.01', 'beauty.n.01', 'land.n.01', 'presence.n.01', 'landscape.n.01', 'body.n.01', 'mountain.n.01', 'food.n.01', 'analyze.v.01', 'ongoing.s.01', 'form.v.01', 'mass.n.01', 'percept.n.01', 'appearance.n.01', 'time.n.01', 'sculptural.a.01', 'production.n.01', 'attention.n.01', 'time_period.n.01', 'issue.n.01', 'language.n.01', 'structure.n.01', 'relationship.n.01', 'identity.n.01']","['materiality.n.02', 'body.n.01', 'waste.n.01', 'beauty.n.01', 'mortality.n.01', 'decay.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/18.PA_.EU_.21.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/18.PA_.EU_.21-206x300.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/butter-mountain/,"['Material_Physical/12.450849150849153', 'Individual_Personal/2.6']","['Material_Physical', 'Individual_Personal']",15.050849150849153,"['Space/6.346153846153846', 'Materiality/1.9090909090909092', 'Environmental/1.7692307692307692']","['Space', 'Materiality', 'Environmental']",10.024475524475523,"['Material_Physical/31.539793539793546', 'Individual_Personal/30.883627483627492', 'Cultural/26.92442002442003']","['Material_Physical', 'Individual_Personal', 'Cultural']",89.34784104784107,"['Culture/8.915384615384614', 'Materiality/8.462271062271062', 'Mind/8.027106227106227']","['Culture', 'Materiality', 'Mind']",25.4047619047619,0.8,0.3333333333333333
Aubrey Williams,"Carib Carnival illustrates Willams’ unique artistic language, combining Pre-Columbian iconography with abstraction. A series of abstracted shapes that resemble bones, masks and serpent-like images surrounded by fiery vapors and gases, illustrate the destruction of culture as one of the predominant themes of Williams’ work. He considered the Mayan and Aztec cultures to exemplify a number of present-day faults; according to Williams they developed technologies that would eventually lead to their own destruction. Williams melds a combination of Gorky and German Expressionsim with his West African heritage, painting what he characterized as “the smell of old blood … the smell of the presence of the conquistadors. It’s the smell of loss, and replacement with lesser than what was destroyed. It’s equality coming out of forced change, a displacement of identity, violation and yet new growth asserting itself.” Williams’ work thus looks at the world from a Guyanese perspective with a strong sense of his African heritage, as well as the destructiveness of European culture. Carib Carnival, while perhaps celebrating the frenzy of carnival, brings to the fore the idea of destruction of civilizations, the destruction by civilizations and an African holocaust. It is a bonfire of civilizations out of which something might rise. There is another image hidden within the work, a bound, reclining figure, perhaps a reference to the rapacious behavior of imperial colonizers and the auto-da-fé.","Brought up in Guyana, Aubrey Williams (1926 -1990) was one of the founding members of the Working People’s Art Group, while at the same time working as an agricultural officer in the field during the period of British colonization in Guyana. He was sent to the jungle to live with the Warrau tribe and this had a profound impact on him and his practice as an artist. The artifacts that he came into contact with, made in secret for fear of being found out by missionary priests, were totemic, and colored with intense natural tones. Williams arrived in London in 1952 as part of the Windrush generation. He went to St Martin’s School of Art and was exposed to the German Expressionists at Marlborough Gallery and the Abstract Expressionists at the Tate and Whitechapel Galleries. While his early exhibitions were greeted with interest, he was soon marginalized by critics and art historians. It was only in 1989, when a series of his works were shown as part of the exhibition “The Other Story” at the Hayward Gallery that he and his fellow black artists emerged from the shadows of a discriminatory history. Williams is now regarded as one of the most important British artists of his generation. Working between abstraction and figuration, his paintings resonate with his own culture while also engaging with Western Modernism.",Carib Carnival,Europe,"['destruction.n.01', 'african.a.01', 'culture.n.01', 'mask.n.01', 'loss.n.01', 'strong.a.01', 'change.n.01', 'combination.n.01', 'abstraction.n.01', 'technology.n.01', 'presence.n.01', 'language.n.01', 'shape.n.01', 'image.n.01', 'mention.n.01', 'identity.n.01', 'idea.n.01', 'sense.n.01', 'position.n.03', 'subject.n.01', 'figure.n.01']","['iconography.n.01', 'destruction.n.01', 'culture.n.01', 'trauma.n.02', 'supplanting.n.01', 'colonialism.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/18.PA_.EU_.22.png,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/18.PA_.EU_.22-300x174.png,https://kadist.org/work/carib-carnival/,"['Society/12.640334087473676', 'Politics/5.016965490649701', 'Individual_Personal/4.881177302229934']","['Society', 'Politics', 'Individual_Personal']",22.53847688035331,"['Violence/5.0255044726440605', 'Colonization/3.3968253968253967', 'Power/2.307692307692308']","['Violence', 'Colonization', 'Power']",10.730022177161766,"['Individual_Personal/31.291050616050622', 'Cultural/22.493492781728083', 'Material_Physical/12.603016591251885']","['Individual_Personal', 'Cultural', 'Material_Physical']",66.38755998903059,"['Mind/9.217582417582419', 'Values/8.404670329670331', 'Culture/6.346153846153846']","['Mind', 'Values', 'Culture']",23.9684065934066,0.3333333333333333,0.0
Aura Satz,"For her telephone sound composition Dial Tone Drone(2014), Satz commissioned a conversation between two old friends, the sound pioneers Pauline Oliveros (1932-2016) and Laurie Spiegel (born 1945). Carried out via iPhone and Skype and prompted by a series of questions from Satz, the pair congenially discuss aspects of drone sounds, which for years have been an important component of their unconventional electronic work, both audio and video. Their interest in drone sounds and use of sustained or repeated sounds, notes, or tone-clusters aligned with Satz’s own interest in alert signals, and the latter’s attempt to forge a new understanding of hypervigilance and emergency through sound as a perceptual trigger of high alert.  After recording the exchange between Oliveros and Spiegel, Satz orchestrated the conversation against a backdrop of a drone composition by each, which move from voice to analogue accordion and to electronic music and converge in the center of the fourteen-minute composition. The first half features excerpts from Horse Sings from Cloud(1975), an accordion score with voice by Oliveros, and the second half features the Expanding Universe(1974-76), a computerized composition by Spiegel.  In their conversation Oliveros and Siegel both agree that although a drone has only one tone, it isn’t static because the listener’s mind will always search for difference. By deciphering small deep patterns, the listener will construe some form of interesting counterpoint. Dial Tone Drone encourages its perambulatory audience to slow down and pay attention, to do more than simply hear.","A key figure among a talented generation of younger artists who engage with sound, Aura Satz has received widespread critical acclaim across her nearly two decade-long practice. Satz’s entry into sound began through a series of projects that revolved around magic, born of an interest in how a ventriloquist’s falsetto voice always seems to emanate right from a puppet’s mouth. At the time she was working with sculpture, performance, and photography, and had made several films using archival footage of magicians in action. She developed a work about the female body, with a magician’s assistant being cut up into pieces and then put together again. Getting inside a historical composition, prying it open and discovering its mechanics, had an impact on how she went on to develop her own camerawork. Satz’s trajectory orbits around two major topics. One involves the art and science of music, sound technology, vibration and acoustics. The other involves social and political factors, especially issues of gender and the rediscovery of important contributions women have made to the development of technology, namely as inventors of new systems of notation, encryption and sound-making.",Dial Tone Drone,Europe,"['sound.n.01', 'tone.n.01', 'conversation.n.01', 'composition.n.01', 'voice.n.01', 'telephone.n.01', 'note.n.01', 'mind.n.01', 'mark.n.01', 'backdrop.n.01', 'universe.n.01', 'pair.n.01', 'component.n.01', 'exchange.n.01', 'form.n.03', 'feature.n.01', 'music.n.01', 'aspect.n.01', 'audience.n.01', 'attention.n.01', 'center.n.01', 'attempt.n.01', 'question.n.01']","['technology.n.01', 'communication.n.01', 'machine.n.01', 'friendship.n.01', 'exchange.n.02', 'acoustics.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/18.PA_.EU_.23.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/18.PA_.EU_.23-300x197.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/dial-tone-drone/,"['Cultural/20.682048163394914', 'Politics/9.398121486356782', 'Material_Physical/5.815908728952207']","['Cultural', 'Politics', 'Material_Physical']",35.896078378703905,"['Technology/8.322987616099072', 'Arts/3.435495223730518', 'Physics/3.4103143233578015']","['Technology', 'Arts', 'Physics']",15.168797163187392,"['Cultural/17.97520828844359', 'Individual_Personal/16.027578304048895', 'Material_Physical/15.692302305537604']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Material_Physical']",49.695088898030086,"['Mind/8.655122655122655', 'Space/8.360159448394743', 'Language/6.3211538461538455']","['Mind', 'Space', 'Language']",23.336435949671245,0.6666666666666666,0.0
Jackie Karuti,"The Planets, Chapter 32 (2017) is a short video that depicts the world at a time of great anxiety. However, it is done with a sharp sense of humor. It starts with a voice explaining that Africa will be partially inundated in the coming year, ending with the impossible relationship between the artist and a chatbot (primitive form of artificial intelligence). Using film animation and DIY techniques, Karuti proposes a history of technology based on different events such as space exploration, and the rise of artificial intelligence. As in several of her works, imaginary characters — a crow and a black silhouette — continue to wander, in search for a new world.","Jackie Karuti is an artist based in Nairobi, Kenya.

Adorned with different pockets, visible through the transparency of the paper and different light bulbs illuminating the form, white cables link the piece to hidden plug sockets, recalling a similar piece made by the artist for the 2015 Ricard Foundation prize. The work is representative of a series of recurrent concepts in the artist’s work manipulation of scale, abstraction through monumentalization, highlighting of tangential objects integrated like sculptural elements by the artist, in a way in which others might try and hide them, as well as the melding of the intimate alongside objects of mass production and the globalization of tastes.","The work of Mélanie Matranga requires a period of adaptation for the observer, not in terms of intellectual or theoretical cognizance — the forms, objects and situations are both quotidian and universal — but rather in terms of emotional and sentimental range. Run through with threads and fluxes of affects, the artist’s work constructs a distance that must be negotiated, one which electrifies the interstice between the private sphere and the public space, between intimacy and togetherness, introspection and the staging of the self. Matranga’s work has the capacity to reflect on the present state of sensation, and the perpetual adjustments taking place between the real and the virtual. She reveals the complexity of sentiment in an immediate and sensitive way. She creates spaces for thought, where bodies communicate with one another when words do not suffice.",My shape,Europe,"['shape.n.01', 'piece.n.01', 'object.n.01', 'mass.n.01', 'times.n.01', 'concluding.s.01', 'abstraction.n.01', 'form.n.01', 'form.n.03', 'sculptural.a.01', 'visible.a.01', 'production.n.01', 'concept.n.01', 'scale.n.01', 'original.s.01', 'paper.n.01', 'elements.n.01', 'light.n.01', 'white.a.01', 'series.n.01']","['abstraction.n.02', 'object.n.01', 'globalization.n.01', 'mass_production.n.01', 'memorial.n.03', 'scale.n.03']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/18.PA_.EU_.28.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/18.PA_.EU_.28-200x300.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/my-shape/,"['Society/7.6956376956376955', 'Material_Physical/3.4270085470085467', 'Cultural/3.1692307692307695']","['Society', 'Material_Physical', 'Cultural']",14.291877011877013,"['Economy/5.838494838494839', 'Arts/2.3692307692307693', 'Materiality/1.7692307692307692']","['Economy', 'Arts', 'Materiality']",9.976956376956377,"['Individual_Personal/17.2702380952381', 'Cultural/13.078962867198165', 'Politics/10.200102821155454']","['Individual_Personal', 'Cultural', 'Politics']",40.54930378359172,"['Values/6.691849816849816', 'Design/4.401307189542484', 'Mind/4.36043956043956']","['Values', 'Design', 'Mind']",15.453596566831859,0.3333333333333333,0.0

Richard Gordon,"San Francisco, Moscone Center is a silver gelatin print from the series American Surveillance, a ten-year-long project where Richard Gordon photographed surveillance cameras across USA. In the image’s foreground we see the silhouette of a man, darkened and in contrast to the bright streetscape unfolding behind him. To the left, an American flag flutters in the wind, saluting the skyscrapers—among them the iconic architecture of the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. The mundanity of the scene is unsettled when we realize a surveillance camera on the top right corner reciprocates the stare of Gordon’s lens, or perhaps the other way. The otherwise quiet image then becomes an exercise of resistance: together with the other images from the series, Gordon’s photograph documents the changes that have taken place in architecture, civic life, especially in a post 9/11 experience of public space. In this new urban landscape, scrutiny and fear can be seen concretely through the normalized, ubiquitous presence of surveillance technology that Gordon captures.","Originally from Chicago, Richard Gordon was a self-taught photographer best known for his intelligent and masterfully printed black-and-white photographs. He began taking photographs in the 60s in Chicago and soon traversed across the country, documenting the public and private lives of Americans through his idiosyncratic lens.

Richard Gordon,"Washington D.C. Constitution Ave. is a silver gelatin print from the series American Surveillance, a ten-year-long project where Richard Gordon photographed surveillance cameras across USA. In the image, a woman and a child walk along Constitutional Avenue as a surveillance camera on the street post directs its gaze towards them. The otherwise quiet image then becomes an exercise of resistance: together with the other images from the series, Gordon’s photograph documents the changes that have taken place in architecture, civic life, especially in a post 9/11 experience of public space. In this new urban landscape, scrutiny and fear can be seen concretely through the normalized, ubiquitous presence of surveillance technology that Gordon captures.","Originally from Chicago, Richard Gordon was a self-taught photographer best known for his intelligent and masterfully printed black-and-white photographs. He began taking photographs in the 60s in Chicago and soon traversed across the country, documenting the public and private lives of Americans through his idiosyncratic lens.

Rometti Costales,"This anarchist flag is made from Huayruro seeds, a native plant of South and Central American tropical areas. In some cases, the Huayruro seeds are used in the preparation of psychotropic plants such as Ayahuasca (Tohé). These plants occupy a central place in Amazon biopolitics.  Anarquismo Mágico – Magical Anarchism – is a speculation about what might have happened during the encounter between an anarchist – a former fighter of the Durruti Column, expatriated in the Bolivian Jungle – and a native, semi-nomad community of the Amazon.

Adelita Husni-Bey,"Postcards from the Desert Island is a remake of a 50s educational film Holiday from the rules in which four children interact with an omniscient narrator who teleports them to a tropical island where there are no rules. As in Lord of the Flies, the little children’s anarchistic society quickly breaks down. Finally, when the narrator asks the children if they want to leave the island they answer unhesitatingly: “instead of making up a lot of rules, why don’t we go home where we already have them?”.  Adelita Husni-Bey’s film shows her collaboration with a self-run public primary school based in Paris, founded in 1962 by the French educator Robert Gloton, a militant of the experimental pedagogical movement Éducation Nouvelle. During a 3three-week workshop, the artist invited the children to turn their school hall into a desert island. The film documents how the group of youngsters embraces a social life in a no-man’s land, showing how they relate to some of the key principles and unresolved problems of self-governance, such as imagining a life without institutions;, questioning of punishment and the struggle for power, wondering how to deal with immigration and civil disobedience, and where to draw the line between public and private realms.","Born in Milan, Italian-Libyan Adelita Husni-Bey is an artist and researcher. Her practice, which encompasses drawing, painting, collage, video, and participatory workshops, concentrates on micro-utopias, and on how the collective memory works as well as questioning the mechanisms of political and economic power and control.  Her background in sociology as well as fine arts has helped in criticizing prevailing systems of organization of advanced capitalist societies in areas such as labour, schooling and housing. She questions the type of visibility there is in producing an artwork on ‘under-represented communities’, and looks for alternatives as a form of reaction to the way Western society is structured. In that sense, her role as an artist strives to instigate reflection on, and effectively produce, alternative social imaginaries.",Postcards from the Desert Island,Europe,"['island.n.01', 'child.n.01', 'rule.n.01', 'school.n.01', 'public.a.01', 'movie.n.01', 'french.a.01', 'militant.n.01', 'struggle.n.01', 'pull.v.01', 'institution.n.01', 'private.a.01', 'life.n.01', 'collaboration.n.01', 'leave.v.01', 'land.n.01', 'paris.n.01', 'document.n.01', 'cardinal.s.01', 'society.n.01', 'establish.v.08', 'power.n.01', 'motion.n.03', 'social.a.01']","['experiment.v.01', 'child.n.01', 'self-government.n.01', 'remake.n.01', 'power.n.01', 'collaboration.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/AHusni-Bey_Adunanza_sala1_ph-©RolandoPaoloGuerzoni_125.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/AHusni-Bey_Adunanza_sala1_ph-©RolandoPaoloGuerzoni_125-300x202.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/postcards-from-the-desert-island/,"['Cultural/6.483516483516483', 'Politics/2.511655011655012', 'Individual_Personal/2.3692307692307693']","['Cultural', 'Politics', 'Individual_Personal']",11.364402264402264,"['Arts/4.026373626373626', 'Power/2.511655011655012', 'Media/2.4571428571428573']","['Arts', 'Power', 'Media']",8.995171495171496,"['Individual_Personal/15.071336996337', 'Cultural/14.763150901386199', 'Society/12.208877397112694']","['Individual_Personal', 'Cultural', 'Society']",42.043365294835894,"['Community/6.315262515262516', 'Spirituality/5.079487179487179', 'Land/4.34065934065934']","['Community', 'Spirituality', 'Land']",15.735409035409035,0.6666666666666666,0.0
The Propeller Group and Superflex,"Fade In (the whole title of the film is actually the entire five page script) is a collaboration with the Danish artist collective Superflex (group of freelance artist–designer–activists committed to social and economic change, founded in 1993 by Jakob Fenger, Rasmus Nielsen and Bjørnstjerne Christiansen).  There are several time layers to understand the story behind this film. In 1601, the San Jago set sail from Goa for Lisbon; the cargo included the first consignment of South East Asian porcelain destined for the European market. During the journey, the cargo was stolen by Dutch pirates and sold on auction in Holland, which generated huge profit boosting the country?s economy. Objects from the San Jago are part of the collection of a historical museum in Holland (the Zeeuws Museum).  In residency at the Zeeuws Museum, Superflex commissioned The Propeller Group to produce a three-part TV-series called “Porcelain” based on this historic event, which was filmed in Vietnam and broadcast on Vietnamese television in March 2010. Authentic objects from the collection were used in the series, as well as fake ?toy replica? wooden guns produced in Vietnam.","The Propeller Group was established in 2006 as a cross-disciplinary structure. Its members, Phunam, Matt Lucero, and Tuan Andrew Nguyen have initiated a multi-platform, based in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam and Los Angeles, California. The Propeller Group is able to produce large-scale works, which expose the strategies of the type of global agency their name suggests. Their use of mass media enables them to combine seemingly contradictory themes: advertising and politics, history and future, and public and private. The Propeller Group often pushes their work back into the public sphere, using commodities as a form of public art. As an integral part of their practice, the group has cultivated the guise of an advertising agency—a public relations firm that confuses the brand and the message.",FADE IN: EXT.

Slavs and Tatars,"Wheat Mollah (2011) is one of Slavs and Tatars composite object. The title Wheat Mollah has various interpretations, from “master” or spiritual authority for Shiites and “friend” for Sunnis. The turban is also worn in a diversity of cultures and religions in Africa, Asia and India. However, in this work, the turban is woven in wheat. For Slavs and Tatars, wheat is almost an atavistic element, used in the emblem of the USSR as well as in that of Iran’s first established bank, Bank Sepah and in the one of the revolutionary guards.  For the writer Fionn Meade, Slavs and Tatars’ object can also be described as “reminiscent of Marcel Broodthaers’s early sculptures that targeted Belgian nationalism and bourgeois complicity in colonialism via comic deployment of mussels, coal, and eggs alongside news from the Congo. Slavs and Tatars’ sculptural mashups of cliché and gravity likewise reside in the tension between literalness, critique, and dismissive laughter.”","Self-described as an “Eurasian-based” collective, Slavs and Tatars investigates the “polemics and intimacies” of the region “east of the former Berlin Wall and west of the Great Wall of China” or Caucasia. As part of their practice, Slavs and Tatars gives lectures and performances that embody the history and multiculturalism of this region they research.

Daniel Keller,"To make the video installation Soft Staycation (Gaze Track Edit), the artist, playing the role of ‘job creator’, hired a group of unemployed and expat freelancers through Craigslist to watch a 30 minute compilation of national tourism ads. These ads, which are generally sponsored by various publicly funded tourism boards and screened in airports for example, were found on the Internet by Keller. He used a gaze-tracking camera to measure the eye movements of the people participating in the experiment. Despite the relentlessness of the source, the subjects define zones of attention that the camera records.  Instead of using the gathered gaze data for any specific research purpose, the consumptive gaze is transmuted onto the video itself, creating an ensemble of light spots and shadows. The film is screened on a large LED screen, the same kind used for advertisement purposes. By staging a typical marketing study, the artist points out the persisting automatisms of consumer-spectators, while the flexible LED curtain makes it quite a sculptural and hypnotic piece.","Daniel Keller belongs to a generation of artists born at the end of the 1980s, nourished by digital imagery, who have participated in the social networks as a communication strategy, combining the public and the private spheres; a logical heir to the “entrepreneur” artist of 1990-2000.  Interested in the existence of the artwork on the Internet, as another – or even an extension – exhibition space, Daniel Keller believes in the participation of the public as a critical authority, who can comment, post, re-post the artwork, etc. He reappropriates participatory strategies (for example using charity bands) that find a new echo with the Internet crowdfunding. In his works and his collaborative projects (AIDS-3D), Keller merges art and technology (including the use of new materials) with special attention to social and ecological issues.",Soft Staycation (Gaze Track Edit),Americas,"['gaze.n.01', 'ad.n.01', 'purpose.n.01', 'camera.n.01', 'eye.n.01', 'occupation.n.01', 'record.n.01', 'national.a.01', 'light.a.01', 'shadow.n.01', 'specific.a.01', 'survey.n.01', 'sculptural.a.01', 'video.n.01', 'attention.n.01', 'screen.n.01', 'beginning.n.04', 'function.n.03', 'motion.n.03', 'people.n.01', 'piece.n.01', 'movie.n.01']","['marketing.n.02', 'technology.n.01', 'track.v.02', 'tourism.n.01', 'data.n.01', 'gaze.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/softstaycation_bd.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/softstaycation_bd-300x205.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/soft-staycation-gaze-track-edit/,"['Society/10.500722394220844', 'Cultural/5.390196078431373', 'Material_Physical/2.4916996047430833']","['Society', 'Cultural', 'Material_Physical']",18.3826180773953,"['Economy/10.500722394220844', 'Technology/2.9', 'Arts/1.7124183006535947']","['Economy', 'Technology', 'Arts']",15.113140694874438,"['Cultural/22.300605113840415', 'Society/15.663908640379233', 'Individual_Personal/11.076556776556778']","['Cultural', 'Society', 'Individual_Personal']",49.04107053077643,"['Economy/6.651210227680816', 'Arts/6.034706959706959', 'Media/5.754151404151404']","['Economy', 'Arts', 'Media']",18.44006859153918,0.6666666666666666,0.6666666666666666
Fernanda Gomes,"For this floor based work, Gomes has taken two lengths of bamboo and tied them together using linen thread. The work is self-supporting and stands in a crack or a hole in the floor. The work suggests precariousness, frailty as well as humanity through its verticality, and its gentle sinuous form, referencing perhaps the work of Giacometti. Other works in the exhibition recalled the work of Mondrian with an emphasis on horizontal and vertical lines. The fact that this work deviates from an emphasis on the rectilinear should be seen within the context of Gomes’s constructivist routes and her interest in Arte Povera. Allowing the material to express its own inner nature is fundamental to her work. The modest nature of her art suggests a poetics of the immaterial. The standing sculpture, modest though it may be, articulates the space of the room, suggesting a near and a far. Gomes generally makes her work in situ, responding to the space the exhibition will occupy, the gallery thus becoming an extension of her studio.","Fernanda Gomes was born and still works in Rio de Janeiro. Her work is within the tradition of Latin American art that engaged in the postwar era with constructivism and minimalism. Lygia Clark, Helio Oiticica, Lucio Fontana are the names that come to mind when thinking of her Latin American antecedents but in terms of her Northern American forebears it is the Minimalist generation of Robert Ryman and Richard Tuttle that have a bearing on her work. Fernanda Gomes should neither be seen as a Minimalist, nor as an artist in the tradition of Arte Povera, to which her work also clearly relates.  Rather she makes paintings, and more particularly sculptures which are intimate, that examine the interface between sculpture and painting, that look at the gap between the intentional and the accidental as well as the purity of form that is disturbed by the patina of age and time. Her action in bringing materials together is transformative. She sees her works as things, rather than paintings or sculptures, things that relate to and have an effect on the space they inhabit. Gomes’s use of found materials is infused with a strong sense of humanity and vulnerability.",Untitled,Americas,"['floor.n.01', 'nature.n.01', 'hole.n.01', 'space.n.01', 'line.n.01', 'studio.n.01', 'cardinal.s.01', 'establish.v.08', 'context.n.01', 'material.n.01', 'sculpture.n.01', 'form.n.01']","['humanness.n.01', 'nature.n.01', 'vulnerability.n.01', 'site.n.02', 'constructivist.n.01', 'self-sufficient.s.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/AJG-FG-00045a-site.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/AJG-FG-00045a-site-200x300.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/untitled-14/,"['Individual_Personal/3.9692307692307693', 'Material_Physical/3.9692307692307693', 'Politics/2.307692307692308']","['Individual_Personal', 'Material_Physical', 'Politics']",10.246153846153847,"['Identity/2.3692307692307693', 'Power/2.307692307692308', 'Familial/1.6']","['Identity', 'Power', 'Familial']",6.276923076923078,"['Material_Physical/5.904029304029303', 'Cultural/4.920751633986928', 'Individual_Personal/3.138461538461539']","['Material_Physical', 'Cultural', 'Individual_Personal']",13.96324247647777,"['Arts/4.14297385620915', 'Identity/2.3384615384615386', 'Space/1.746031746031746']","['Arts', 'Identity', 'Space']",8.227467140702434,0.6666666666666666,0.3333333333333333
Karla Black,"Karla Black is a Scottish artist living in Glasgow. Her work draws from a multiplicity of artistic traditions from expressionist painting, land art performance, to formalism. Her large-scale sculptures incorporate modest everyday substances, along with very traditional art-making materials to create abstract forms. Black chooses her media for their tactile aesthetic appeal: the familiarity of the texture of cellophane or the scent of cosmetics bridges the experience of tangible matter with the intimacy of memory or the subconscious. Black’s process is intensely physical and this energy is conveyed through ‘impromptu’ staging of her work; this suggestion of performance psychologically involves the viewer with the making process, provoking instinctive responses to her precarious assemblages. Black’s work evinces childhood memories of cakes and candy floss, of birthdays and ice cream. It is absorptive, immersive and engaging, painterly and sculptural, ephemeral and yet permanent. It always has a fragile appearance and is often fragile, capable of being destroyed by a draught or the actions of a viewer. It teeters on the edge of being and non being.     Not Today is essentially a painting on three sheets of transparent plastic suspended from the walls by scotch tape. These materials are typical of Black’s art.  Suspended in front of a white wall or even a window, the work is as much about light as it is about colour. The layers of the painting coalesce into one plane when the visitor stands before it and yet as a layered painting it also has actual depth.  Black says of her work: “sculpture … can be a pure engulfment and absorption in the material world, when you’re not even aware of yourself, when you have no self consciousness, and you’re not being watched and you’re just purely absorbed in the material world. That is the best possible kind of escape – when you are fully connected to yourself. I think about art as a place to behave, as an escape, not just for me but for the people looking at it,” says Black.  Her emphasis is on materials and their behaviour. “My work is just rooted in the physical, it just is a thing; it’s real. You don’t have to think, “What does it represent?” or “What does it mean?” It is just, like, it is here. And you’re here. And it is just that exchange.“","Karla Black is a Scottish artist living in Glasgow.

Hassan Massoudy,"Ranging from Baudelaire to the Koran, each of Hassan Massoudy’s drawings are titled with a quotation from a text. In the case of La beauté sauvera le monde, the text originated from Dostoyevsky’s The Idiot, alluding to aspirations, models of behavior and words of wisdom. The image itself, though generated in a hybrid manner relating to Arabic and Japanese calligraphy, suggests both fluttering flags and buildings rising high out of the desert as one would see in many developing Middle Eastern countries.","Hassan Massoudy trained as a classical calligrapher in Baghdad before attending the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris in 1969. The prevailing themes of his work are peace and tolerance. Working also in performance, Massoudy has taken his work beyond calligraphy to grapple with landscape, architecture, human emotions and experience. Moving beyond the repetitious nature of calligraphy, Massoudy has invented his own adapting language that refers to traditions of both painting and calligraphic writing. The turning point came when he envisioned Arabic letters as sculptures in the desert outside of Najaf. Massoudy’s work is thus a melding of the Arabic and European tradition situated in the liminal space between abstraction and figuration.",La beauté sauvera le monde,Middle East & Africa,"['flag.n.01', 'japanese.a.01', 'model.n.01', 'building.n.01', 'state.n.04', 'drawing.n.01', 'manner.n.01', 'image.n.01']","['language.n.01', 'text.n.01', 'religion.n.01', 'landscape.n.01', 'architecture.n.01', 'emotion.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Massoudy.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Massoudy-238x300.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/la-beaute-sauvera-le-monde/,"['Individual_Personal/25.286380286380293', 'Cultural/13.62917654241184', 'Society/5.168376068376069']","['Individual_Personal', 'Cultural', 'Society']",44.083932897168204,"['Emotion/14.500299700299703', 'Language/4.746031746031746', 'Spirituality/4.314285714285715']","['Emotion', 'Language', 'Spirituality']",23.560617160617163,"['Cultural/9.416666666666668', 'Individual_Personal/8.07627666451196', 'Material_Physical/5.283516483516483']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Material_Physical']",22.776459814695112,"['Arts/4.510897435897436', 'Mind/3.995604395604396', 'Culture/2.307692307692308']","['Arts', 'Mind', 'Culture']",10.814194139194141,0.6666666666666666,0.0
Emeka Okereke,"Bariga Nights is a photographic series set in the Bariga neighborhood in Lagos (Nigeria). This district has the reputation as home to some of the most disenfranchised of an estimated 21 million inhabitants of Lagos. After several years of being on the road across Africa, Europe and North America, Okereke decided to stay in Lagos in 2016. He took an apartment in Bariga and since has actively photographed daily life in the neighborhood. This series results from his everyday encounters with his neighbors. He states,“The premise of my photographic work here is not to portray poverty, but rather the poetry in everyday acts of living.”","Emeka Okereke is a Nigerian visual artist and writer who lives and works between Lagos and Berlin, moving from one to the other on a frequent basis. A past member of the renowned Nigerian photography collective Depth of Field (DOF), he holds a bachelor’s/master’s degree from the Ecole nationale supérieure des beaux arts de Paris and has exhibited in biennales and art festivals in cities across the world, notably Lagos, Bamako, Cape Town, London, Berlin, Bayreuth, Frankfurt, Nuremberg, Brussels, Johannesburg, New York, Washington, Barcelona, Seville, Madrid and Paris. In 2015, his work was exhibited at the 56th Venice Biennale, in the context of an installation titled A Trans-African Worldspace.  Okereke is the founder and artistic director of Invisible Borders:  The Trans-African Project, an artist-led initiative that addresses gaps and misconceptions posed by frontiers dividing the 54 countries of the African continent. The project’s flagship undertaking is the Invisible Borders Trans-African Road Trip, wherein up to a dozen artists, including photographers, writers, filmmakers and performance artists collectively travel across Africa to explore and participate in various photographic events, festivals and exhibitions, while engaging on a daily basis with, and producing work about/in collaboration with, the people and the places they encounter.   Okereke’s work oscillates between diverse mediums. He employs photography, video, poetry and performative interventions in the exploration of one over-arching theme:  that of borders. Another aspect of his practice lies in project organizing and lecturing: coordinating artistic interventions that promote exchanges cutting across national and international platforms. In 2008, he organized the first ever photographic exchange project between schools in France and Nigeria – the Yaba College of Arts and Technology Lagos and Ecole nationale supérieure des beaux arts de Paris. This was followed by Crossing Compasses: Lagos-Berlin Photo Exchange and Converging Visions: Nigeria-Netherlands Photo Exchange (2012).

Laura Gannon,"The impressionistic surface of Wild Money (2017) recalls the 1950s paintings of Philip Guston. Its creases recall human skin, while the filigree pattern of red skeins implies what lies beneath. The body is fully implicated in this work. The ink is applied to both sides of the linen and suggests an inner and outer dimension. The titles of Gannon’s work frequently reference books: in this case Wild Money by Luna Jaffe, a visual artist and psychotherapist. It is a book aimed at artists about feelings for money and the artist’s relationship to money. In Wild Money, Gannon speaks both to the materiality of the densely woven fabric and the spaces that are opened up through the cuts.","Laura Gannon works across a range of media: painting, drawing, sculpture and video. With a background in film, she has often installed her video work using dividing elements, screens or benches, to create selective viewing experiences for her audience. The artist has recently developed a series of paintings using metallic ink on unstretched linen. At the end of the painting process, the artist cuts into the linen. While cutting gestures inevitably make reference to the work of Lucio Fontana, Gannon’s interests are different. Fontana was interested in breaking the picture plane, the cuts in his work created dark mysterious slits.

Vaclav Pozarek,"Concerning his objects, Pozarek often relies on chance to guide him. He uses scraps of wood, boxes, hinges and doors, keeping a close eye on what position each object will assume later in the space. Although it suggests the opposite at first glance, Zwillinge is autonomous and functionless. Assembled from found wood and aluminium, and making use of empty and in-between space, it makes a quasi-serious impression, as if they have an important task to fulfill. As part of an ensemble, these objects become actors that play specific roles that can change depending on the constellation. With the specific installation of this work, the gallery’s architecture is accentuated as a frame of reference. Pozarek’s working method is anything but capricious, dreamy, or playful. He works with a target in mind, even though the formal theme of his work first emerges when he is modelling the materials.","Growing up in Czechoslovakia, Vaclav Pozarek experienced political aggression, spying and ludicrous impediments. For a long time, he was denied of almost everything; the only remaining thing allowed was for him to become a toolmaker. However, later he found work as a typographer in Pilsen. There was the official doctrine of Socialist Realism, but the fact that the art should serve a political purpose was, for Pozarek, off the cards. In 1968 he left, first to Hamburg and London, where he studied under Anthony Caro at Central Saint Martin’s School of Art, before settling in Bern. In Bern, Pozarek developed a synthesis of the Constructivist principles and the application of the arts to everyday reality. Pozarek’s practice traverses predominantly sculpture and drawing, while also incorporating installations, photography, and film.",Zwillinge,Europe,"['wood.n.01', 'specific.a.01', 'object.n.01', 'mind.n.01', 'method.n.01', 'eye.n.01', 'opportunity.n.01', 'glance.n.01', 'change.v.01', 'box.n.01', 'actor.n.01', 'space.n.01', 'formal.a.01', 'position.n.01', 'architecture.n.01', 'frame.n.01', 'impression.n.01', 'function.n.03', 'mention.n.01', 'subject.n.01', 'undertaking.n.01', 'material.n.01']","['materiality.n.02', 'architecture.n.01', 'space.n.02', 'object.n.01', 'realism.n.03', 'everyday.s.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/VP_Zwillinge_2017_part1_1_FotoNickAsh.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/VP_Zwillinge_2017_part1_1_FotoNickAsh-184x300.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/zwillinge/,"['Material_Physical/6.509090909090909', 'Cultural/4.476307189542483', 'Individual_Personal/3.312418300653595']","['Material_Physical', 'Cultural', 'Individual_Personal']",14.297816399286988,"['Materiality/2.909090909090909', 'Arts/2.6985294117647056', 'Space/1.8']","['Materiality', 'Arts', 'Space']",7.407620320855615,"['Individual_Personal/15.613986160038795', 'Cultural/13.768212669683262', 'Material_Physical/6.840903540903541']","['Individual_Personal', 'Cultural', 'Material_Physical']",36.2231023706256,"['Mind/5.644133644133644', 'Values/4.332142857142857', 'Arts/3.4985294117647054']","['Mind', 'Values', 'Arts']",13.474805913041207,1.0,0.3333333333333333

Andrey Shental,"Descent into the Fungal is a two-channel video and a sculptural installation. The mushroom / sculptural element is site-specific and is grown from readymade mushroom blocks sold by mushroom farmers. They are given two weeks to mature and follow their natural cycle, bringing the natural element directly into the white cube.One video channel is situated within a scientific method of thinking— the artist thinks about issues of symbiosis and the ways in which fungal networks are intertwined with their surroundings. Here, the natural becomes the digital and vice-versa.The other video is from the perspective of the mushroom— it has its own language, albeit compressed and digitized in nature. The video presents fungi as a conscious being, giving personality and human-like behaviour to it. Presented on a green-screen background void of any surroundings, this channel contrasts with the documentary side and shows the fungus as its own sentient self. The two channels are displayed facing each other, leaving the viewer situated between the ‘scientific’ and the ‘mushroom speak’.","Andrey Shental is an independent artist, theorist, cultural critic, and curator based in Moscow.

Leslie Shows,"Human Quarry is a large work on paper by Leslie Shows made of a combination of acrylic paint and collage. Both through its title and formally—through how the shapes in the composition resemble a mountain or natural formation—the piece relays us to a mineral quarry or a deep mining pit where materials are extracted. Interspersed among the block-like figures and rocky textures, we also see several human silhouettes, either cut-out, or as if they were whited out by a shining light, or lost in the shadows. There’s additional evidence of human presence: architectural features such as steps and a window, and symmetrical forms that resemble an X-ray scan or an inkblot from a Rorschach test. These references are collisions of opposing forces—positive and negative space, light and dark, presence and absence, consciousness and the subconscious. Together they comprise a complex excavation that somehow equates human experience with geological time, as if the spectral figures were layers of sediment from civilizations past.","Although at first Leslie Shows’ work might read as abstract compositions, a close inspection reveals her expanded approach to painting and the deeper connections she has forged between her practice and the realms of geology, the passing of time and the imaginary. Her works are usually large in scale and materially rich, deftly combining a lush and diverse arsenal including sand, paint, metal, fabrics, plexiglass, ink, and collage among others. Whether hung sideways in diamond-like shapes, or laden with folds, fragments and textures that stretch and drip, her work is rarely confined within the limits of a frame. A key aspect of Shows’ practice is an interest in the various ways in which we relate to the natural world. She has taken inspiration from the mineral pyrite, or iron pyrite, also known as fool’s gold; from water formations from the faces of rocks; and even from calcified mining ruins that the artist remembers from her childhood spent in Juneau, Alaska. Whether suggesting forms from nature like beehives, or emulating the textures of crystals and marble or the shapes of minerals, each piece connects us to a place, a landscape, real or imagined.",Human Quarry,Americas,"['human.a.01', 'presence.n.01', 'light.n.01', 'figure.n.01', 'mountain.n.01', 'dark.n.01', 'consciousness.n.01', 'architectural.a.01', 'combination.n.01', 'lose.v.01', 'shadow.n.01', 'feature.n.01', 'paint.n.01', 'layer.n.01', 'complex.a.01', 'collage.n.01', 'natural.a.01', 'paper.n.01', 'shape.n.01', 'composition.n.01', 'mention.n.01', 'experience.n.01', 'title.n.01', 'material.n.01', 'piece.n.01']","['nature.n.01', 'geology.n.01', 'architecture.n.01', 'civilization.n.01', 'humanity.n.01', 'time.n.03']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_Leslie-Shows_Human-Quarry.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_Leslie-Shows_Human-Quarry-224x300.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/human-quarry-2/,"['Material_Physical/8.399924712968192', 'Individual_Personal/7.862095875139353', 'Cultural/5.864444198732124']","['Material_Physical', 'Individual_Personal', 'Cultural']",22.12646478683967,"['Physics/3.3150762281197066', 'Familial/3.1210702341137124', 'Arts/2.6985294117647056']","['Physics', 'Familial', 'Arts']",9.134675873998123,"['Cultural/17.68832327802917', 'Individual_Personal/9.811939350639044', 'Material_Physical/9.616117216117217']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Material_Physical']",37.11637984478543,"['Design/4.863247863247863', 'Mind/4.0796380090497735', 'Arts/3.9645550527903475']","['Design', 'Mind', 'Arts']",12.907440925087984,1.0,0.3333333333333333
Hao Liang,"Eight Views of Xiao and Xiang is a series of landscapes in the Xiaoxiang region in the modern day Hunan Province, China, and was a popular subject of poems, drawings and paintings during the Song Dynasty (960–1279). Liang follows tradition by interpreting the historical subjects by classical Chinese artists including Dong Yuan (934–962 AD), Mu Xi (died in 1281 AD), Wen Weiming (1470–1559 AD). This reinterpretation represents the meeting point of the Xiang River and the Dongting Lake. The artist’s use of light, shadow and color creates a simultaneously flat and three-dimensional space on the silk surface. By employing the Chinese technique of ink painting on silk, Hao Liang proposes a sophisticated reflection on the complex relationship between tradition and modernity.","The work of Hao Liang reimagines and explores the sublime of contemporary ecological landscapes. His traditional Chinese ink paintings refer to the past and the present in an effort to modernize tradition. Influenced by Chinese antiquity, Liang’s practice uses contemporary language with references to the past and in so doing rejects the temporal modalities of chronological time and modern-day national boundaries and identity. Through his long-term research on landscapes, gardens and urban culture, the artist questions why Chinese culture has such a close relationship with tradition.",Eight Views of Xiao and Xiang V,Asia,"['chinese.a.01', 'tradition.n.01', 'song.n.01', 'river.n.01', 'region.n.01', 'shadow.n.01', 'china.n.01', 'technique.n.01', 'day.n.01', 'complex.a.01', 'popular.a.01', 'modern.a.01', 'contemplation.n.02', 'color.n.01', 'surface.n.01', 'light.n.01', 'historical.a.01', 'relationship.n.01', 'artist.n.01', 'position.n.03', 'subject.n.01', 'drawing.n.01', 'landscape.n.01', 'space.n.01', 'series.n.01']","['tradition.n.01', 'modernity.n.01', 'reinterpretation.n.01', 'landscape.n.01', 'identity.n.01', 'antiquity.n.03']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Capture-d’écran-2019-02-27-à-13.18.16.png,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Capture-d’écran-2019-02-27-à-13.18.16-300x139.png,https://kadist.org/work/eight-views-of-xiao-and-xiang-v/,"['Individual_Personal/16.556954156954163', 'Cultural/11.946886446886447', 'Material_Physical/5.771794871794873']","['Individual_Personal', 'Cultural', 'Material_Physical']",34.27563547563548,"['Mind/5.574358974358974', 'Identity/4.797979797979798', 'Media/3.998168498168498']","['Mind', 'Identity', 'Media']",14.37050727050727,"['Cultural/16.217453891138106', 'Material_Physical/14.898748619801252', 'Individual_Personal/13.604872191791703']","['Cultural', 'Material_Physical', 'Individual_Personal']",44.72107470273106,"['Mind/6.596727395411606', 'Arts/4.205128205128205', 'Culture/4.038461538461539']","['Mind', 'Arts', 'Culture']",14.84031713900135,1.0,0.3333333333333333
Karrabing Film Collective,"The Mermaids, or Aiden in Wonderland is a surreal exploration of Western toxic contamination, capitalism, and human and non-human life. Set in a land and seascape poisoned by capitalism where only Aboriginals can survive long periods outdoors, the film tells the story of a young Indigenous man, Aiden, taken away when he was just a baby to be a part of a medical experiment to save the white race. He is then released back into the world to his family. As he travels with his father and brother across the landscape he confronts two possible futures and pasts embodied by his own tale and the timely narratives of multinational chemical and extractive industries. The psychedelic and fragmented nature of the film reflects the insidious, creeping violence of toxicity that corrupts the psychology of those who are structurally, economically, and politically displaced. As Aiden, a stranger to his own land is reinserted into existence; he becomes acquainted with territorial nature and folklore – mermaids, a bee, a cockatoo bringing forth a pertinent inquiry of whose and which lives matter.","Karrabing Film Collective (est. 2013) is an award-winning group of filmmakers and artists, most of whom are Indigenous to the lands and coasts along northwestern Australia. They approach filmmaking as a mode of self-organization and a means of investigating contemporary social conditions of inequality. Through the collective’s inventive artistic language, their work challenges historical and contemporary structures of settler power. The films represent their lives and through the process create bonds with their land while intervening in global images of Indigeneity. In the Emiyengal Indigenous language Karrabing means ‘tide out’. It refers to a time of coming together, as well as to the coastline that connects the Karrabing Film Collective as an extended family group across social lines.  Their films and installations have been exhibited at Contour Biennale, Mechelen, Belgium; Berlinale Forum Expanded; Hallucinations, documenta 14, Athens; Sydney Biennale; vdrome.org; e-flux supercommunity at the Venice Biennale; Doc’s Kingdom, Lisbon; and Wexner Center for the Arts, Columbus, Ohio, among others.","Mermaids, or Aiden in Wonderland",Asia,"['land.n.01', 'narrative.n.01', 'nature.n.01', 'race.n.01', 'exploration.n.01', 'father.n.01', 'being.n.01', 'movie.n.01', 'western.a.01', 'matter.n.01', 'future.n.01', 'time_period.n.01', 'set.n.01', 'violence.n.01', 'family.n.01', 'white.a.01', 'human.a.01', 'landscape.n.01', 'life.n.01']","['capitalism.n.01', 'subspecies.n.01', 'perniciousness.n.01', 'autochthonal.s.01', 'narrative.n.01', 'psychedelic.s.03', 'nature.n.03', 'colonialism.n.01', 'animal.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/TheMermaidsHazmatJojo-copy-2.png,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/TheMermaidsHazmatJojo-copy-2-300x169.png,https://kadist.org/work/mermaids-or-aiden-in-wonderland/,"['Society/2.8333333333333335', 'Cultural/1.9090909090909092', 'Individual_Personal/1.8']","['Society', 'Cultural', 'Individual_Personal']",6.542424242424242,"['Fantasy/1.9090909090909092', 'Economy/1.8333333333333335', 'Identity/1.0']","['Fantasy', 'Economy', 'Identity']",4.742424242424242,"['Material_Physical/22.877999777999783', 'Individual_Personal/16.250349650349655', 'Cultural/10.294011544011545']","['Material_Physical', 'Individual_Personal', 'Cultural']",49.422360972360984,"['Materiality/7.487412587412587', 'Time/6.107070707070707', 'Land/6.083516483516483']","['Materiality', 'Time', 'Land']",19.677999777999776,0.6666666666666666,0.0
Jesús ‘Bubu’ Negrón,"The series of drawings Cancha Abierta (Yellow Series) derive from a project in which Jesús ‘Bubu’ Negrón worked with the community of El Rosario, located in the region of Beni, Bolivia, approximately 500 meters away from the Mamoré River. Due to a major flood that affected the vicinity–the largest recorded to date–the location had been practically buried under mud. One of the most distressed areas was the basketball court, which was buried underneath three feet of mud. Taking into consideration the site’s context, Negrón organized an “archeological” excavation to dig out half of the court. After working for four days with the help of the community and other invited artists from the Abubuya workshop, where the artist was in residence, they were able to remove most of the accumulated sludge. When the project was finished, the community organized the first basketball game, and through that simple act, the court was restored. This series of drawings serve as narrative depictions and records of this project.","Jesús Cruz Negrón, also known as ‘Bubu’, is an artist whose work is characterized by site-specific gestures and interventions that make no separation between art and life. His work consists of photography, sculpture, drawing, writing, performance, video and is often characterized by minimal interventions, the re-contextualization of everyday objects, and a relational approximation to artistic production as a revealing act of historical, social, and economic proportions. His works commonly act as tributes to daily survival in Latin America, revealing the experiences of ordinary people and the world of injustice that surrounds them by presenting it in elite spaces such as art fairs and biennials. His practice is a relational approximation to artistic production, a revealing act of historical, social and economic critique. Negrón lives in the neighborhood of Puerta de Tierra in San Juan, where he is part of grassroots community organizations for the preservation and well-being of the neighborhood, its history, and its people.",Cancha Abierta (Yellow Series),Americas,"['community.n.01', 'undertaking.n.01', 'drawing.n.01', 'series.n.01', 'river.n.01', 'record.n.01', 'region.n.01', 'locate.v.01', 'location.n.01', 'game.n.01', 'simple.a.01', 'narrative.s.01', 'artist.n.01', 'context.n.01']","['community.n.01', 'intervention.n.01', 'relational.s.01', 'flood.n.01', 'excavation.n.01', 'archeology.n.01', 'preservation.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/IMG_JBN_canchaabierta_WEB3.jpeg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/IMG_JBN_canchaabierta_WEB3-232x300.jpeg,https://kadist.org/work/cancha-abierta-yellow-series-2015/,"['Cultural/8.068809278097202', 'Society/4.6923076923076925', 'Material_Physical/2.380952380952381']","['Cultural', 'Society', 'Material_Physical']",15.142069351357277,"['Arts/3.934640522875817', 'History/2.0', 'Urbanization/1.6923076923076925']","['Arts', 'History', 'Urbanization']",7.62694821518351,"['Society/12.48159340659341', 'Material_Physical/10.801154401154403', 'Cultural/10.052747252747253']","['Society', 'Material_Physical', 'Cultural']",33.33549506049506,"['Space/5.086868686868687', 'Spirituality/4.057142857142857', 'Economy/3.3321428571428573']","['Space', 'Spirituality', 'Economy']",12.476154401154401,1.0,0.0

Li Ming,"In the eight-channel video installation Movement, Li Ming uses his body as a prop to interact with different means of transportation. Each channel features footage of the artist moving forward, jumping between various modes of transportation that weave in and out of the frame in a carefully orchestrated choreography. As the artist descends from the loader bucket of a moving construction tractor, he jumps onto a skateboard which he then discards as he lays on top of a suitcase that continues rolling forward. Running, skating, sliding on a trolley, chasing lifts from bicycles, trucks, excavators, tuk-tuks, all form part of his journey. The synchronization of the eight videos binds the parallel narratives together, creating the effect of the artist chasing his own image in an endless loop unravelling across the same city-scape. The use of repetition and seriality that and deceptive impression of linearity, echoes the illusion of time/space that is commonly used in Hollywood films.","Li Ming creates video, installation, performance and photography that explores the relationships between individuals and society through the lens of their interactions with daily objects and their direct environments. In 2008, Li Ming founded the art collective Double Fly Art Center, known for enacting humorous and anarchic public actions such as staging a mock bank robbery and faking orgasms while getting their feet massaged. The collective’s focus on improvisation, spontaneity and the nonsensical nature of their endeavours have become an important influence for on Li Ming’s practice, who in his recent videos, has relied on his own body to reveal hidden connections between space, time, himself and various social issues he perceives around him. His videos often have a purposefully grainy, shaky, and near amateur quality, reflecting the carefree ethos that defines his practice.

Lin Ke,"Jet Folder & Data Tree (2013) offers a humorous take on how computer and screen-based technologies affect our relationship to the natural world. In a statement through his gallery, Gallery Yang, Lin remarks that “one day in 2010, I discovered that the folders in my computer began talking to me. So I created lots of empty folders with no content but name.” Lin’s print, by extension, functions as a collage in which screen-based media becomes part of the natural world, and vice versa. By superimposing computer icons over “real” objects like airplanes or leaves in his photographs, Lin parodies familiar assumptions that photograph documents the real world by revealing the relative ease of manipulating the medium. At the same time, he also suggests that our increasing reliance on screen-based technologies affects our perception and relationship to the natural world. In Lin’s rendering, we can only see the natural world through the layer of a computer-based intervention, suggesting a much more trenchant divide between false and physical realities.","Lin Ke’s video and media-based installations explore how perceptual experiences of our surrounding environments are mediated and altered by various technologies. Computer operating systems, social media platforms, and screen displays become objects of aesthetic inquiry in his work, and his practice is deeply invested in the relationship between human beings and the natural world. Lin’s work offers various insights on contemporary iterations of virtual reality and the ways in which computer-based media affects our physical relationship to our own bodies by warping our sense of time, space, and stimulation. Boredom is a recurring theme throughout his work and plays on larger metaphors of disconnection from both interpersonal interactions and real space.",Jet Folder & Data Tree,Asia,"['natural.a.01', 'technology.n.01', 'real.a.01', 'relationship.n.01', 'medium.n.01', 'statement.n.01', 'airplane.n.01', 'icon.n.01', 'percept.n.01', 'familiar.a.01', 'tree.n.01', 'function.n.01', 'intervention.n.01', 'day.n.01', 'layer.n.01', 'physical.a.01', 'collage.n.01', 'document.n.01', 'world.n.03', 'object.n.01', 'photograph.n.01', 'time.n.01']","['technology.n.01', 'nature.n.01', 'screen.n.01', 'antonym.n.01', 'ruse.n.01', 'contrast.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/jet_folder_and_data_tree-90x60-2013_web.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/jet_folder_and_data_tree-90x60-2013_web-300x200.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/jet-folder-data-tree/,"['Cultural/5.959426847662142', 'Material_Physical/2.523076923076923', 'Individual_Personal/2.3692307692307693']","['Cultural', 'Material_Physical', 'Individual_Personal']",10.851734539969835,"['Arts/2.481649069884364', 'Technology/1.9', 'Materiality/1.7230769230769232']","['Arts', 'Technology', 'Materiality']",6.104725992961288,"['Cultural/47.666246335363965', 'Material_Physical/8.42154512154512', 'Individual_Personal/8.211091832144463']","['Cultural', 'Material_Physical', 'Individual_Personal']",64.29888328905355,"['Media/11.031749622926094', 'Arts/10.809116210586797', 'Design/7.088084464555053']","['Media', 'Arts', 'Design']",28.928950298067946,1.0,0.3333333333333333

Lucia Madriz,"In her geometric paintings on wood panel, Madriz employs the Fibonacci numbers to illustrate, in simplified form, the pattern of natural plant growth—beginning from a single stem, and growing exponentially, rationally, and efficiently outward from there. Tinting the underlying wood but not covering it, Madriz’s delicate cubes seem to hover on the surface of the warm wood surfaces, drawing more attention to the grain and its own natural pattern. Always drawing the attention back to the natural world, Madriz’s multimedia works aim to reassert the natural, and our own links to it.","Born in Costa Rica and living in Germany, artist Lucía Madriz has a global perspective. Her videos, paintings, and installation works deal with issues of global concern—specifically agriculture, genetically modified crops, and the sustainability of our shared natural resources. Her interest in these issues has led her, in recent years, to develop installation projects where images are formed out of careful arrangements of seeds, grains, and dried beans—crops that sustain life in most of the globe’s cultures, and ones that are heavily implicated in the United State’s experiments with genetic modification.",Untitled,Americas,"['wood.n.01', 'natural.a.01', 'form.n.03', 'attention.n.01', 'surface.n.01', 'geometric.s.01', 'purpose.n.01', 'plant.n.01', 'individual.a.01', 'form.n.01']","['design.n.04', 'nature.n.03', 'agribusiness.n.01', 'sustainability.n.01', 'acculturation.n.02', 'botanic.a.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/img_lucia_madriz_untitled-child_of_threetree11_web.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/img_lucia_madriz_untitled-child_of_threetree11_web-300x200.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/untitled-lucia-madriz/,"['Individual_Personal/11.728205128205133', 'Cultural/8.842490842490841', 'Material_Physical/7.505685618729097']","['Individual_Personal', 'Cultural', 'Material_Physical']",28.07638158942507,"['Economy/5.931219073324336', 'Mind/4.774358974358975', 'Culture/3.6025641025641026']","['Economy', 'Mind', 'Culture']",14.308142150247413,"['Cultural/11.094871794871798', 'Society/5.51025641025641', 'Individual_Personal/4.8981684981684985']","['Cultural', 'Society', 'Individual_Personal']",21.50329670329671,"['Mind/4.128937728937729', 'Design/3.3076923076923075', 'Culture/3.107692307692308']","['Mind', 'Design', 'Culture']",10.544322344322346,0.6666666666666666,0.6666666666666666
Margo Wolowiec,"Wolowiec’s textile work Not This Time (2015) translates pixelated images into sensuous fabric and ink based forms that are at once beautiful in their abstraction and anxiety-ridden in their visualization of a malfunctioning digital world. In order to produce this work, Wolowiec selects a grouping of digital images from web-based sources that have a glitch, an aberration in which a short-lived technical fault results in distortions in an image’s display. Through a dye sublimination ink process, the images are printed onto strands of thread pixel by pixel, which the artist then weaves into a final work. The resulting textile piece resembles a stunningly diffuse landscape of amorphous greyscale forms that alternately reference blurry screens and darkly portentous night skies. By translating these visual blips and aberrations into permanent forms, Wolowiec challenges our assumptions that digital phenomenon can only exist in the ephemeral, and her modern tapestries feel both familiar and startlingly innovative. Towards the bottom of the work, Wolowiec marks the fabric with a brown cross, gesturing towards the practice of selecting photographs on a contact sheet with an x. This mark not only becomes a sign of the maker’s hand – it is also a graphically symbolic representation of the increasingly narrow gap between ancient handcrafts such as weaving, traditional imaging making practices such as photography, and contemporary digital/new media techniques.","Margo Wolowiec is a post-emerging artist who works predominantly with textile. Her abstracted fiber wall hangings reference patterns found in Navajo rugs and Bauhaus weavings; often rendered in black, white, and greyscale, they could be interpreted as Modernist tapestries. Wolowiece’s handwork, however, is anything but retrograde and her forms are largely sourced from visualizations of glitches and aberrations found on Internet-based social networking platforms such as Instagram, Facebook, and Tumblr. In translating pixelated images into fiber art through painstaking technique of hand dye and weaving, Wolowiec offers a wholly original response to producing art in the digital age by narrowing the gap between traditional practices of handcraft and contemporary modes of image making offered through new media technologies. She has exhibited domestically and internationally at venues such as Jessica Silverman Gallery, San Francisco; Lisa Cooley, New York; and di Rosa, Napa.

Robert Zhao Renhui,"Expedition #46 is a work from the series “The Glacier Study Group,” which consists of artists, scientists, activists, and enthusiasts of glacial and polar activity in the Artic Circle to conduct scientific investigation, data collection, and glacier sampling. Recent media attention on global warming and climate change has driven interest in increased glacial activity. The group spends long period of each year in the harsh Arctic environment to acquire in-depth knowledge of these changes while experiencing the landscape firsthand. Expedition #46 presents voyeuristic images of human activity in expansive surreal glacial landscapes to elicit a sense of discovery in the viewer, who travels by-proxy via Zhao’s photographic series. The viewer is able to observe the Study Group’s journey in observing their environment and engage in critical reflection of the varying documentary spectatorship deployed in the visual discourse of environmentalism and scientific research.","Robert Zhao Renhui’s photographic prints question fact-based presentations of conservation and highlight the manner through which documentary, journalistic, or scientific reports sensationalize nature in order to elicit viewer sympathy. Zhao portrays human as figures curious about their natural environment, which is at times mysterious and unpredictable. Through observing human behavior in front of animals rather than that of the animals themselves, Zhao’s critical lens examines various modes of what he calls a “zoological gaze,” the manner through which humans view animals and nature. His works create visual ambiguity so the viewer becomes aware of assumptions made about the way images present facts.

Peter Robinson,"Defunct Mnemonics (2012) plays off woodworking traditions found in indigenous art in order to create a body of formally minimal objects that are both beautiful in their restraint and profoundly moving in their associations with the totemic. Resembling large pick-up-sticks, the complete work is comprised of 126 vertical sculptures wrapped in fabric with alternately monochromatic and graphically patterned dyes and prints. Leaning against a wall and arranged side-by-side, they could be mistaken as highly decorated mallets for use in an undetermined ritual or game. These associations with faith and repetition are entirely intended: as part of Robinson’s process, each sculpture was hand carved and finished based on a case of spirit sticks housed at the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa, New Zealand’s national museum and art gallery in Wellington. In order to produce another layer of tactile experience and texture, Robinson wrapped every stick in a roll of concentric felt, in some cases switching between fabrics as means of creating a richly heterogeneous finish to the work. The visual and aural codes at play in Defunct Mnemonics are a reminder of how repetition can help us order ourselves through more deeply felt rhythms. At once both playful and meditative, Robinson’s work encourages us to slow down and retrain our focus through considered visual and metaphorical stops and starts.","Peter Robinson is an artist whose work explores the various cross-sections between materiality, identity, and the indigenous. Many of his works utilize motifs found in Maori art, and his use of woodworking and felted wools often riff on culturally specific materials based in communal craft practices. His clean lines and deliberately restrained forms, though, could be easily placed alongside Minimalist sculpture and feel unselfconsciously modern. Robinson studied at the Ilam School of Fine Arts and has exhibited extensively throughout New Zealand. In 2001, his work was included in the exhibition bi-polar at the Venice Biennale.",Defunct Mnemonics,Asia,"['repeat.n.01', 'association.n.01', 'fabric.n.01', 'museum.n.01', 'ocular.a.02', 'sculpture.n.01', 'brooding.s.01', 'spirit.n.01', 'rhythm.n.01', 'playful.a.01', 'national.a.01', 'print.n.01', 'see.v.05', 'layer.n.01', 'game.n.01', 'play.n.01', 'produce.v.01', 'tradition.n.01', 'hand.n.01', 'establish.v.08', 'wall.n.01', 'experience.n.01', 'procedure.n.01', 'make.v.03', 'body.n.01']","['minimalism.n.01', 'totemic.a.01', 'metaphorical.s.01', 'repeat.n.01', 'brooding.s.01', 'rhythm.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/peter_robinson_defunct_mnemonics_installation_web.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/peter_robinson_defunct_mnemonics_installation_web-225x300.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/defunct-mnemonics/,['Material_Physical/3.3384615384615386'],['Material_Physical'],3.3384615384615386,"['Time/2.5692307692307694', 'Physics/0.7692307692307693']","['Time', 'Physics']",3.3384615384615386,"['Cultural/41.9819237951591', 'Society/26.519688644688646', 'Individual_Personal/24.976123876123886']","['Cultural', 'Society', 'Individual_Personal']",93.47773631597164,"['Arts/13.791691804927101', 'Culture/11.592063492063494', 'Spirituality/11.333633033633035']","['Arts', 'Culture', 'Spirituality']",36.71738833062363,0.0,0.0
Taiki Sakpisit,"A Ripe Volcano, a collaboration with Yasuhiro Morinaga, revisits two sites of violence and aggression in Thailand’s recent past: The Rattanakosin Hotel, the site where the military troops captured and tortured the civilians, students and protestors who were hiding inside the hotel during the Black May of 1992; and Ratchadamnoen Stadium, a Roman amphitheater-style Muay Thai boxing arena, which was built in 1941-45 during the Second World War and since then has become the theatrical labyrinth for more acculturated and commercially “acceptable” displays of bloodshed. The work builds around the recollections of human experiences that took place within these spaces and shifts through the mental space distilled from the possessed memory of wounded time. Within the medium of the multi-channel video/ sound installation, Sakpisit and Morinaga create dreamlike variations sprawling through darkened room where the haunting images and ambient sounds float through the space, creating an exquisitely hypnotizing experience. A Ripe Volcano is an allegorical revelation where Bangkok becomes a site of mental eruption and the emotionally devastated land during the heights of terrors, primal fears, trauma, and the darkness of time. Through a rich use of saturated color and diffuse light, the film evocatively recalls the histories of the various figures – soldiers, protestors, boxers, and spectators – whose traumatic experiences still haunt the empty rooms they once occupied. The remains of these intense experiences and traces of memories are rendered here through a kind of imaginative cinematic re-embodiment, the physical and psychological pain and suffering transformed into the dreamlike landscape of images. A Ripe Volcano, by extension, both pays tribute to these embodied histories while also creating a new space for healing through artistic expression and creative connection with audiences.","Taiki Sakpisit is a filmmaker and media-based artist whose work explores depictions of violence and unease that emerged from the political upheaval in Thailand from the late 1980s to the present day. A deftly skilled editor, his work frequently incorporates sophisticated use of montage and soundscape to produce experiences that are both sensually resonate and narratively disjointed as part of a larger strategy to disorient audiences and engage them in heightened modes of viewership. Sakpisit has screened his films extensively in venues throughout Southeast Asian and has been included in festivals at the Tokyo Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Gio Verona Video Festival, and the Birbeck Institute for the Moving Image, London.",A Ripe Volcano,Asia,"['experience.n.01', 'sound.n.01', 'space.n.01', 'memory.n.01', 'soldier.n.01', 'transform.v.01', 'psychological.s.01', 'dark.n.01', 'injury.n.01', 'fear.n.01', 'history.n.01', 'creative.a.01', 'shift.n.01', 'display.n.01', 'collaboration.n.01', 'military.a.01', 'black.n.01', 'trace.n.01', 'connection.n.01', 'time.n.01', 'land.n.01', 'expression.n.01', 'audience.n.01', 'physical.a.01', 'violence.n.01']","['violence.n.01', 'aggression.n.01', 'military.n.01', 'history.n.01', 'bloodshed.n.01', 'wound.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/a_ripe_volcano_06_web.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/a_ripe_volcano_06_web-300x84.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/a-ripe-volcano/,"['Society/10.387563843703298', 'Material_Physical/3.3090909090909095', 'Politics/2.541176470588235']","['Society', 'Material_Physical', 'Politics']",16.237831223382443,"['Violence/6.77162181471779', 'Time/2.509090909090909', 'War/1.7826086956521738']","['Violence', 'Time', 'War']",11.063321419460872,"['Individual_Personal/18.719394640447277', 'Material_Physical/12.900630088865386', 'Society/11.606011635423402']","['Individual_Personal', 'Material_Physical', 'Society']",43.22603636473606,"['Emotion/10.543223443223445', 'Violence/5.567550096961861', 'Time/5.101851090086384']","['Emotion', 'Violence', 'Time']",21.21262463027169,0.6666666666666666,0.6666666666666666
Hiraki Sawa,"Hako (2006) depicts a mysterious and dystopic landscape where the world becomes flat: distance between different spaces, depth of field and three-dimensional perceptions are canceled. Interiors of a Victorian doll’s house, a rippled seascape, a palm tree forest, and a gravel seashore are superimposed, morphing into each other. The hermetic narrative is charged with psychological and mythological aspects. Hako reflects Sawa’s interests in psychotherapies, in particular, the sand tray therapy, also known as sandplay, created by Dora Kalff. Sandplay asks participants to create their own arrangement of objects in a sandbox by choosing from a wide range of small figures to which the subconscious attaches symbolic meanings. Echoing this process, Sawa creates his imaginary dimensions where rules and selected elements allow for improvisation and play to reveal unconscious processes. Certain elements give visual clues and metaphorically comment on issues such as the hybridity of the human and the non-human. This is indicated by walking trees and a miniature toy clock that is animated to keep real world time in order to ponder the illusionary concept of linear time. Reality is not scientific. As the fantastical becomes everyday and the supernatural becomes commonplace, so does the reverse.","London-based Japanese artist Hiraki Sawa’s video installations and filmic works probe landscapes, psychological dreamlands, domestic interiors, imaginary spaces, ideas of displacement and migration, and above all, the inner self. He weaves animals, people, plants, animated and inanimate objects into a series of surreal sequences to create enigmatic and immersive worlds of sound and image. Employing a combination of digital editing and hand-made methods of cutting, pasting and collaging, Sawa highlights the ambiguous boundaries between facts and fictions and meditates on how remembrance and memory can be manipulated by time, emotion and mental influences.",Hako,Asia,"['tree.n.01', 'elements.n.01', 'procedure.n.01', 'make.v.03', 'rule.n.01', 'psychological.s.01', 'field.n.01', 'agreement.n.04', 'distance.n.01', 'uncover.v.01', 'percept.n.01', 'dimension.n.01', 'time.n.01', 'aspect.n.01', 'symbolic.a.01', 'concept.n.01', 'play.n.01', 'house.n.01', 'issue.n.01', 'inspire.v.01', 'real.a.01', 'everyday.s.01', 'meaning.n.01', 'world.n.03', 'ocular.a.02']","['percept.n.01', 'psychotherapy.n.01', 'symbolism.n.01', 'unconscious_mind.n.01', 'supernatural.n.01', 'fiction.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/hiraki_sawa_hako_2006_web.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/hiraki_sawa_hako_2006_web-300x225.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/hako/,"['Cultural/12.830128205128206', 'Individual_Personal/8.491350316350315', 'Material_Physical/1.7142857142857142']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Material_Physical']",23.035764235764237,"['Fantasy/7.291666666666667', 'Mind/5.847119547119546', 'Culture/3.076923076923077']","['Fantasy', 'Mind', 'Culture']",16.21570929070929,"['Individual_Personal/32.94148172089349', 'Cultural/29.591686418157014', 'Material_Physical/9.843986568986569']","['Individual_Personal', 'Cultural', 'Material_Physical']",72.37715470803707,"['Mind/13.143864468864471', 'Culture/12.61868131868132', 'Values/9.008089133089134']","['Mind', 'Culture', 'Values']",34.770634920634926,1.0,0.6666666666666666

Kiran Subbaiah,"Flight Rehearsals focuses on Subbaiah’s desire to fly as a means to highlight the relationship between human ambition and limitations of the physical world. The video presents philosophical explorations of the human desire to defy gravity and time. The minimalist set of a table highlights the intention and persistence of the protagonist rather than technological innovation. The video manipulates the camera angle to distort the appearance of space so that Subbaiah’s repeated attempts at beating gravity can achieve momentary flights. As the flight attempts move into the bedroom, what first appears to be a close up of an alarm clock turns out to be an oversized ringing alarm clock further back to create a distortion of space through manipulations in scale. Such effects highlight both the proximity and distance between apparent success and distorted perception.","Born in Sidpur and living in Bangalore, Kiran Subbaiah works in a variety of media that includes assemblage, video and internet art after initial training as a sculptor. His works examine the relationships of use and value in everyday objects through subverting form and function.

Wong Wai Yin,"In this work the artist stages a humorously violent “intervention” against male-dominated cultures of art production in present-day China. For this video, Wong accompanied six male friends from art school to a group show of their work titled “Inside Looking Out” at Osage Gallery in Beijing. Throughout her visit, she was rarely acknowledged for her own creative accomplishments and was more frequently introduced as an artist’s girlfriend, and often without name. Although inspired by Conceptual art of the 1960s, Wong had never considered her prior work to be in conversation with Feminist Art. Her encounters in Beijing, however, compelled her to address her experience of gendered erasure and discrimination. In her black and white video, Wong stands off camera with a metal stool in hand. As the six artists from the “Inside Looking Out” show appear on screen, Wong hits each one on the head with the stool, provoking winces and laughs from her “victims.” Wong makes it clear that the artists are willing participants, and their laughter and over exaggerated expressions of pain signal that they are “in” on the joke. But Wong’s slapstick violence here is for more than parodic effect, and in staging these violent interventions in miniature, she signals the need for a decisive rupture against art world patriarchies that foreclose opportunities for female and non-binary artists.","Wong Wai Yin experiments with a variety of media, ranging from painting, sculpture, collage, installations and photography. Her extensive body of work calls into question the role of art in our economic structure and the arbitrary value given to works of art. She forces us to think about notions of quality, utility and value and challenges our belief in the credibility of one of the most important middle-class pastimes, in Hong Kong in particular, that of shopping. Wong takes the ephemera daily lives; the things we take for granted in our wallets or handbags, the everyday bits and pieces we pick up from the supermarket, and the things we throw away and re-presents them to us transformed into original hand-crafted works of art. She does this in ways that are wanton, witty and whimsical. Her work is playful, irresponsible and capricious, and as a result, completely engaging and irreverent of presumed boundaries between gallery-exhibited art and daily life. Her videos and installation, by comparison, are reminiscent of the conceptual art of the 1960s that questioned the process of making art, authorship and the definition of art as a unique original object in an age of mechanical reproduction.",Tribute to Inside Looking Out - For the male artists along my way,Asia,"['artist.n.01', 'intervention.n.01', 'female.a.01', 'opportunity.n.01', 'brush.n.06', 'creative.a.01', 'black.a.01 white.a.01', 'school.n.01', 'conversation.n.01', 'china.n.01', 'head.n.01', 'expression.n.01', 'see.v.05', 'video.n.01', 'production.n.01', 'screen.n.01', 'inspire.v.01', 'violence.n.01', 'hand.n.01', 'black.a.01', 'white.a.01', 'camera.n.01', 'experience.n.01', 'culture.n.01']","['discrimination.n.01', 'feminist_movement.n.01', 'patriarchy.n.01', 'temper.n.02', 'inequality.n.01', 'sex.n.04']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/wong_wai_yin_tribute_web_copy.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/wong_wai_yin_tribute_web_copy-300x253.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/tribute-to-inside-looking-out-for-the-male-artists-along-my-way/,"['Individual_Personal/14.35780885780886', 'Society/5.121794871794871', 'Politics/3.774509803921569']","['Individual_Personal', 'Society', 'Politics']",23.2541135335253,"['Emotion/11.35780885780886', 'Inequality/3.774509803921569', 'Violence/2.371794871794872']","['Emotion', 'Inequality', 'Violence']",17.504113533525302,"['Politics/12.843455074337427', 'Cultural/12.677655677655682', 'Society/11.059606243429773']","['Politics', 'Cultural', 'Society']",36.58071699542288,"['Power/5.575452488687783', 'Activism/4.048868778280543', 'Culture/4.0']","['Power', 'Activism', 'Culture']",13.624321266968327,0.6666666666666666,0.0
Yang Xinguang,"Although seemingly unadorned at first glance, Yang Xinguang’s sculptural work Phenomena (2009) employs minimalist aesthetics as a means of gesturing towards the various commonalities and conflicts between civilization and the natural world. Comprised of rudimentary planks of wood hammered together into a rectangular form, Yang’s work uses reclaimed materials from everyday life and seems deliberately in conversation with Arte Povera, the art movement that originated in Italy during the late 1960s where practitioners produced art from found and common materials as an act of resistance against the decided commercialization of the art world through market economies. Yang, by extension, pays close attention to his materials in attempt to release the forms within them rather than impose his own. He rarely adds anything to the materials that he uses; instead, he chisels, pares and scrapes the excess away, allowing his completed works to emerge through a combination of happenstance and almost meditative handwork. In Phenomena, Yang’s handwork becomes apparent in a constellation-like form scratched into the wood. Suddenly, the nails and knots in the wood’s surface become vertices in a larger web of connecting lines, suggesting the inexorable interconnections between our alternately fabricated and naturally occurring environments. Rather than privileging one over the other, Yang’s work invites us to contemplate these relationships and how these coessential phenomena define our existence.","Yang Xinguang is an artist whose work explores the interconnections between the natural world fabricated materials in a post-industrialist society. His work is deliberately restrained and frequently uses reclaimed materials such as found wood planks, a gesture that recalls the Arte Povera movement’s commitment to using un-rarified and common materials in art making practice. His work is also deeply invested in exploring the phenomenological relationship between viewers and artworks, and his sculptural installations gesture towards Minimalist traditions, inviting viewers to pause and consider their own relationship to their surrounding space. Yang is a graduate of the Central Academy of Fine Arts in China. He has exhibited extensively throughout China and has had international exhibitions at venues such as Artissima, Turin, and Art 41 Basel in Switzerland.",Phenomena,Asia,"['wood.n.01', 'phenomenon.n.01', 'material.n.01', 'form.n.01', 'everyday.s.01 life.n.01', 'brooding.s.01', 'market.n.01', 'glance.n.01', 'being.n.01', 'aesthetics.n.01', 'combination.n.01', 'late.a.01', 'conversation.n.01', 'economy.n.01', 'common.a.01', 'resistance.n.01', 'sculptural.a.01', 'line.n.01', 'attention.n.01', 'natural.a.01', 'environment.n.01', 'attempt.n.01', 'everyday.s.01', 'surface.n.01', 'relationship.n.01']","['object.n.01', 'surface.n.01', 'everyday.s.03', 'modernism.n.01', 'commonplace.s.01', 'criticism.n.02']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/xinguang_yang_phenomena_web.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/xinguang_yang_phenomena_web-300x200.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/phenomena/,"['Cultural/12.249811463046761', 'Society/3.91025641025641', 'Material_Physical/3.888888888888889']","['Cultural', 'Society', 'Material_Physical']",20.04895676219206,"['Arts/6.40365761689291', 'Economy/2.371794871794872', 'Design/2.307692307692308']","['Arts', 'Economy', 'Design']",11.08314479638009,"['Cultural/34.32537754643018', 'Society/22.92159244264508', 'Individual_Personal/19.357857931542142']","['Cultural', 'Society', 'Individual_Personal']",76.6048279206174,"['Arts/10.502789023841656', 'Economy/8.431501831501834', 'Time/7.828571428571428']","['Arts', 'Economy', 'Time']",26.76286228391492,0.6666666666666666,0.6666666666666666
Dominique Zinkpè,"Dominique Zinkpè’s works with a wide range of materials, from jute to used cars to “hôhô” figures, which come from the Cult of Twins in southern Benin as a voodoo religion symbole of fertility. His portfolio is continually morphing between mediums and subjects, tackling issues such as intimacy, sex, the sacred and the profane while linking ancestral culture with the contradictions found in today’s world. These sketches of tumultuous human drama are infused with elements of irony and satire to reveal Zinkpè’s most disturbing and arresting constructs of the imagination. In Cosmos Animiste, Dominique Zinkpé presents a world of ghosts. They show the transformation that people, animals and vegetation undergo, through contact with their environment – an animistic idea. Borrowing from dreams and the world of the spirits, the quasi-human characters in this painting hover above a modern city, and seem agitated in a battle involving desire and metamorphosis. The strange, hybrid beings — both man and animal — engage in scenes of dance, evoking the transcendental power play deeply rooted in Benin culture vis-à-vis games of masquerade, sex and gender. Energetic in its lively colors but at the same time through fragile drawing, reminiscent of graffiti (a big inspiration for Dominique Zinkpé), this painting reminds one of hastily scribbled notes. This little scenery could disappear at once, as it was an epiphany. Drawing from the aesthetic currents and beliefs of the past, this painting underscores unresolved tensions that have arisen from the fusion of Catholicism, animism, and indigenous traditions, with contemporary culture.","Dominique Zinkpé was born in 1969 in Cotonou, Benin.  Dominique Zinkpè is arguably one of the most recognizable contemporary artists to emerge from Benin. He is a versatile self-taught artist, producing drawings, paintings, sculptures and installations. His vivid paintings and drawings are both intimate and revealing, often denouncing injustice and hypocrisy. Beginning at an early age, Zinkpè’s artistic skill was rewarded early on when he won the Young African Talent Prize at the 1993 Grapholies Art Festival in Abidjan, Ivory Coast. Ten years later, during the Dak’art Biennial of Contemporary Art held in the Senegalese capital, he received the prestigious UEMOA Prize for his installation Malgré Tout !. Active and politically aware, Zinkpè developed “Boulev’art: Artists in the Street” in 1999, a project that seeks to bring the work of local contemporary artists to wider attention. Since its creation, six subsequent manifestations of this public rally have taken place in Benin and France. Moreover, in an effort to share his artistic knowledge with others, Zinkpè founded the Ayïzo – Œuvre de l’Esprit association in 1999, which has since opened the “Unik-lieu de création contemporaine”, an artistic space to train and promote contemporary artists. It is also with this goal in mind that Zinkpè assumed his duties as event organizer of the 2010 Benin Biennial.",Cosmos animiste,Middle East & Africa,"['play.n.01', 'culture.n.01', 'ghost.n.01', 'dance.n.01', 'note.n.01', 'transformation.n.01', 'universe.n.01', 'imagination.n.01', 'uncover.v.01', 'dream.n.01', 'animal.n.01', 'aesthetic.a.01', 'desire.n.01', 'colors.n.01', 'game.n.01', 'tension.n.01', 'concept.n.01', 'modern.a.01', 'issue.n.01', 'tradition.n.01', 'environment.n.01', 'elements.n.01', 'idea.n.01', 'contemporary.s.01', 'power.n.01']","['ghost.n.03', 'latent_hostility.n.01', 'fusion.n.01', 'sex.n.04', 'contradiction.n.01', 'metamorphosis.n.03']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Dominique-Zinkpè-Cosmos-Animiste-©-Raphael-Fanelli-site.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Dominique-Zinkpè-Cosmos-Animiste-©-Raphael-Fanelli-site-300x300.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/cosmos-animiste/,"['Individual_Personal/4.700854700854701', 'Material_Physical/2.3619909502262444', 'Cultural/1.9473684210526314']","['Individual_Personal', 'Material_Physical', 'Cultural']",9.010214072133577,"['Language/1.9473684210526314', 'Spirituality/1.9230769230769231', 'Body/1.7777777777777777']","['Language', 'Spirituality', 'Body']",5.648223121907332,"['Individual_Personal/66.02136197136196', 'Cultural/40.49947927889104', 'Material_Physical/24.71509911656971']","['Individual_Personal', 'Cultural', 'Material_Physical']",131.23594036682272,"['Mind/19.369230769230768', 'Culture/15.365287653522952', 'Values/13.192673992673992']","['Mind', 'Culture', 'Values']",47.92719241542771,1.0,0.0
Hayoun Kwon,"Lack of evidence is the account of a Nigerian called Oscar exiled in France, which confronts a historical and social reality with a personal and intimate testimony. Taking as a point of departure Oscar’s request for asylum in France, this fictional document is a peregrination on the different levels of the reconstitution of memory and the subjectivity of its interpretation.  Oscar’s legal testimony reveals a dramatic reality taking place in Nigeria, where family executions still exist in the case of having twins who are considered a ‘diabolical off-spring’. Oscar’s request was rejected based on a lack of evidence. With the use of 3D, Kwon reassessed the real and fictitious qualities of Oscar’s story. The film is constructed through sequences juxtaposing different realities and then by becoming an ideal mise en abîme of the story. The image becomes an elastic characteristic memory and recalls the process of reconstitution. From another perspective, this film questions what constitutes proof and whether this artistic reconstitution of a traumatic event could be used as major evidence, whether art can have an “objective” dimension.","Born in 1981 in Seoul, South Korea Lives and works in Paris and Nantes   Hayoun Kwon was born in South Koera in 1981 and moved to France in 2011 to pursue her studies at the Nantes School of Art and Le Fresnoy, where she presented the video Lack of evidence for her final diploma. The complex relationship with her home country plays a leading role in her work and issues of immigration, political relations, national and extraterritorial laws are a consistent interest. To address these political questions, Kwon became very skilled in using animation, keeping a balance between a real and fictional register.

Daniela Ortiz,"Previously, Ortiz produced a series of photographs related to her research on the position of ‘service architecture’, the vital space given to domestic servants in the modernist architectural houses of South American upper class families.  Following the same formal principal, she has developed a new series called Estat nacio. This  work presents a critical point of view on the construction of a national sovereignty through speeches and laws concerning people who are not considered as citizens according to immigration legislation and the regulations affecting immigrants’ rights and freedom. The project presents an analysis of historical figures related to colonialism, still visible in the public spaces of Barcelona, mainly through monumental statues of military figures, politicians or industrial figures. The series is accompanied by images of institutions that financed and collaborated in colonialism such as the Bank of Barcelona or the Overseas Hispanic Society. A text contextualizes each image and serves as a historical reference for each figure or institution. This is a critical answer to speeches referring to the idea of a Nation-State characterized by a territory, a precise population with a common language and culture.","Through her work, Daniela Ortiz aims to generate visual narratives in which the concepts of nationality, racialization, social class and gender are explored in order to critically understand structures of colonial, patriarchal and capitalist power. Her recent projects and research deal with the European migratory control system, its links to colonialism and the legal structure created by European institutions in order to inflict violence towards racialized and migrant communities. She has also developed projects about the Peruvian upper class and its exploitative relationship with domestic workers. Recently her artistic practice has turned back into visual and manual work, developing art pieces in ceramic, collage and in formats such as children books in order to take distance from Eurocentric conceptual art aesthetics.",General Joan Prim i Prats,Unspecified,"['address.n.03', 'institution.n.01', 'figure.n.01', 'critical.a.01', 'historical.a.01', 'population.n.01', 'series.n.01', 'district.n.01', 'national.a.01', 'architectural.a.01', 'military.a.01', 'space.n.01', 'class.n.01', 'common.a.01', 'formal.a.01', 'position.n.01', 'see.v.05', 'visible.a.01', 'architecture.n.01', 'house.n.01', 'name.v.01', 'construction.n.01', 'american.a.01', 'language.n.01', 'society.n.01']","['monument.n.02', 'immigration.n.01', 'colonialism.n.01', 'inequality.n.01', 'sovereignty.n.03', 'institution.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/work_prim_daniela_ortiz_baja_2817.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/work_prim_daniela_ortiz_baja_2817-300x87.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/general-joan-prim/,"['Politics/9.686586658955079', 'Society/9.197275239380502', 'Individual_Personal/3.3931623931623935']","['Politics', 'Society', 'Individual_Personal']",22.277024291497973,"['Inequality/3.5426065162907268', 'Power/2.6654761904761903', 'Geopolitics/1.9473684210526314']","['Inequality', 'Power', 'Geopolitics']",8.155451127819548,"['Cultural/15.838201177907067', 'Society/15.134340659340662', 'Material_Physical/11.580097680097683']","['Cultural', 'Society', 'Material_Physical']",42.55263951734541,"['Arts/9.975930115636', 'Urbanization/8.569505494505494', 'Land/8.352747252747253']","['Arts', 'Urbanization', 'Land']",26.89818286288875,0.3333333333333333,0.0
Köken Ergun,"The Battle of Karbala was a military engagement that took place on 10 Muharram, 61 AH (October 10th, 680) in Karbala, situated in present day Iraq, when Hussein, the grandson of the prophet Muhammad, was killed. This battle is central to Shia Muslim belief in which Hussein’s martyrdom is commemorated each year, in a celebration called Ashura which symbolises the birth of Muslim division still at issue today between the Shia and Sunni. During Ashura, the artist worked in close collaboration with the people of Zeynebiye (referring to Hussein’s courageous sister, Zeyneb), documenting their preparations for the ceremonies, which involve a mass theatre performance and the isolated, weeping ritual at the end of the Ashura day. What in other countries is celebrated through a collective performance of blood and pain is experienced here through a highly theatrical and emotional day, presenting Islam as the practice of a culture rather than politics. Ergun attempts to question the cultural importance of religions against a “radical secularism” that has ruled Turkey until now.","Born in Istanbul, in 1976, Köken Ergun studied acting and worked with the American theatre director Robert Wilson. He then became interested in contemporary art, especially video and performance.

Paul Czerlitzki,"In this painting made in 2014, which is part of a series started in 2013, the artist dismantles the traditional painting process. Putting aside any formal intervention, the artist lets the membrane slowly soak up white monochrome paint through a transferring technique before removing it. In some places the structure of the canvas can be seen, while other places of the canvas are purposely blurred to evoke the texture of the material used. Although the artist’s actions can seem surprisingly simple, they express an intellectual potential and a visual complexity that allow the spectators, if not force them, to perceive the work in a clear, definite and slow way.","Born 1986 in Danzig, Pologne Lives and works in Düsseldorf and Paris   Paul Czerlitzki’s work takes part in a reflection on painting and its material components. “The artist has therefore selected a methodological process with which he can repeatedly renegotiate, discover and critically examine painting’s material preconditions, i.e., the frame, the canvas and paint, and the objective, namely, to produce a (panel) painting. He dismantles existing orders by using the canvas as a membrane through which to apply or press colours. He also positions the canvas in relation to the space, as in an installation, or else removes it from the frame and mounts it again slightly off.” (Suzanne Friedli and Elisabeth Gerber)",Ohne Tittle,Europe,"['complexity.n.01', 'formal.a.01', 'intervention.n.01', 'technique.n.01', 'paint.n.01', 'traditional.a.01', 'simple.a.01', 'structure.n.01', 'action.n.01', 'white.a.01', 'ocular.a.02', 'procedure.n.01', 'material.n.01', 'spectator.n.01', 'series.n.01']","['soak.n.01', 'slow.a.02', 'membrane.n.01', 'painting.n.01', 'procedure.n.01', 'nontraditional.a.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/paul-czerlitzki-st-2013.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/paul-czerlitzki-st-2013-197x300.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/ohne-tittle/,"['Cultural/12.476062989298287', 'Society/7.2835164835164825', 'Material_Physical/4.24174538911381']","['Cultural', 'Society', 'Material_Physical']",24.00132486192858,"['Arts/6.845537958773253', 'Spirituality/3.257142857142857', 'Culture/2.4349206349206347']","['Arts', 'Spirituality', 'Culture']",12.537601450836744,"['Cultural/21.506349206349213', 'Society/17.03553113553114', 'Politics/13.768584356819654']","['Cultural', 'Society', 'Politics']",52.31046469870001,"['Arts/7.255311355311355', 'Economy/5.598168498168498', 'Power/4.087912087912088']","['Arts', 'Economy', 'Power']",16.94139194139194,0.6666666666666666,0.3333333333333333
Nora Schultz,"Halfway between a painting and an installation City Sound of Rug gathers found images, synthetic foam, painted metal plates, and prints placed on the floor. Rugs are elements representative of commerce and related to the idea of territory, handicraft and community. In City Sound of Rug, the rugs are used as surfaces upon which prints are manually made. The traces of paint on the synthetic foam and the paint transfers from one rug to another, enable the spectator to see the materials used as tools, elements that constitute the structure of the installation. City Sound of Rug also incorporates advertising billboards of real estate projects. The work focuses on architecture and urbanism. The use of color is essential in this work: the blue, red and green marks become signs and characterize the work like an act of speech.","Born 1975, Frankfurt / Main, Germany   Lives and works in Berlin  Nora Schulz explores the relations between painting, sculpture, performance, and language. She tends to capture the moment where forms become signs and elements of language. She is interested in translation and in the shifts that occur when external realities and cultural patterns are readapted. She mainly works with industrial materials that she collects in the surroundings of her studio in Berlin (metal of all sorts, rugs, shafts, tubes, ropes). Process and shifting are the bases of her practice which concerns transformation within each context. She remodels found objects into abstract sculpted paintings characterized by precarious balance.

Hossein Valamanesh,"In Runner there are two elements:a big painting and a rolled Persian rug. The rug refers to Iran’s cultural history. The travelling tribes used to transport rugs through the desert on camels or horses so that they would always have a comfortable place to sleep and dream. The oldest known rug is from the 6th century before J.-C. The rugs’ iconography is related to the mythical Paradise garden. The rug used  in Runner refers to the idea of moving in space to emigration and the artist’s story.  The big picture made of natural materials (red sand and lotus flowers) refers to Aboriginal paintings and their relation to cosmic forces. This big abstract surface is a reminder of both the Australian and the Iranian deserts. As in most of his work, Hossein Valamanesh knits a dialogue between two cultures while revealing the universal character of each of them, and situates the individual at the center of this configuration.","Born in Teheran in 1949, Hossein Valamanesh immigrated to Australia in 1973 while going back regularly to Iran. His work is often made out of natural material or found objects such as Persian rugs, family photo albums or clothes. He is influenced by Persian poetry and Sufism, which brings a metaphysical questioning related to his personal reflections. He starts from his own cultural story as an emigrant; from his encounter with another culture to question the human condition. When he arrived in Australia he discovered Aboriginal art which made him decide to stay and settle in Australia. Since then, he has had direct contact with these Aboriginal communities interested in the relation between nature and the cosmos.",Runner,Middle East & Africa,"['force.n.01', 'dialogue.n.01', 'dream.n.01', 'abstraction.n.01', 'relation.n.01', 'picture.n.01', 'red.s.01', 'century.n.01', 'natural.a.01', 'person.n.01', 'center.n.01', 'surface.n.01', 'elements.n.01', 'idea.n.01', 'fictional_character.n.01', 'cultural.a.01', 'culture.n.01', 'material.n.01', 'narrative.n.01', 'history.n.01', 'space.n.01']","['emigration.n.01', 'cross-cultural.a.01', 'tradition.n.01', 'universal.n.03', 'desert.n.01', 'rug.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/VALAMANESH-Runner-image1-copie.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/VALAMANESH-Runner-image1-copie-300x210.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/runner/,"['Individual_Personal/10.936752136752139', 'Cultural/7.346794871794872', 'Material_Physical/4.8369909502262445']","['Individual_Personal', 'Cultural', 'Material_Physical']",23.120537958773255,"['Mind/4.774358974358975', 'Culture/3.269230769230769', 'Geopolitics/2.8473684210526313']","['Mind', 'Culture', 'Geopolitics']",10.890958164642377,"['Individual_Personal/28.074561876032476', 'Cultural/22.365454480160373', 'Material_Physical/14.247411068463702']","['Individual_Personal', 'Cultural', 'Material_Physical']",64.68742742465655,"['Mind/9.469036845507436', 'Values/7.60467032967033', 'Design/5.589671766142354']","['Mind', 'Values', 'Design']",22.66337894132012,1.0,0.3333333333333333
Lee Kit,"The work Tender is composed of several elements: a porcelain spoon, a florescent lamp box, a small portable night light, a shelf with nearly invisible embossments of flowers and a jar of jam resting on a black plastic tray. The cardboard painting is made of acrylic and inkjet ink on which we can read Tender. Tender is a brand of extra soft tissue paper, it refers to an intimate comfort but results in a sentiment of melancholy and absence. This installation is made of universal elements. Nothing is context specific however, it’s always site specific, in the sense that he uses very small gestures to alter the situation of a given space.","Born in 1978 in Hong Kong Lives and works in Taipei, Taiwan   Lee Kit represented the Honk Kong pavilion at the Venice Biennale in 2013 where the exhibition was turned into a half functional private space. The visitor entered a neutral room, open and loose but precisely organized. The artist was searching to deliver both an atmosphere and a still image. In fact, the artist uses the term “setting” to define his paintings, ready-mades or performances. His work comments on the long-term dialectic between form and function. Once made, his hand-painted pieces of cloth are used for picnics and diners and his monochrome sheets of linen serve as blankets, pillows or tablecloths in exhibitions. He says, “I am not expressing an emotion: I am expressing my attitude through my paintings”. These objects are clues of his biography as they express a form of life, his daily life in Honk Kong. And if the name of a brand appears on his cardboard paintings, it is less a reference to consumerism (i.e. Pop art) than a love for details. If there is a reference to art history, it would be the 17th century Dutch painter Johannes Vermeer for his depiction of middle class interiors, his attention to details and light.

Uri Aran,"Like much of Aran’s work this sculptural installation is akin to a riddle. It has no exact meaning, and it can be somewhat frustrating, yet with careful inspection it begins to reveal unexpected information. In his 2014 exhibition at Peep-Hole, Milan, where this work was shown, Aran referred in a series of new works to Mancala games. These ancient pastimes (popular throughout the Middle East, Africa and Asia) typically employ a perforated board and pieces formed out of seeds or stones. In an analogy to agricultural activity, Mancala games are at once elementary and poetically allusive; in their combination of improvised apparatus, rudimentary rules and metaphorical potency, they furnish an oblique metaphor for Aran’s art, in particular his ranging, open-ended and atemporal mode of sculpture. The still-life assemblage Game II elaborates upon the idea of ‘art as game’, embodying the same basic interplay of organization and chance, recalling childhood games and activities. While the work invokes Giacometti’s No More Play it also suggests the active processes of making works of art, conscious, unconscious and trial and error.","Born in 1977 in JerusalemLives and works in New York.  Uri Aran, born in Israel and based in New York, is young artist working in sculpture, installation, video and drawing. Much of Aran’s work is about grouping things together, assembling the detritus of the studio, images and objects that relate to his own life, in an attempt to make sense out of random things. He has stated: “In my own work the excitement and simultaneous pathos associated with the limitations of taxonomy are always present. I don’t establish logical equivalencies (…) instead I take parts of lists, classifications and narrative habits and I pluck, recapitulate and re-assign. My work has nothing to do with nonsense – in fact quite the opposite. I activate the highly sensitive reflex responses that a viewer might have to a trigger such as a piece of music, food, or a photo and I adjust the allegiances of that reflex. In this manner objects, language, intonation, everything develops an eccentricity that can be unnerving, perplexing, funny, poetic, and tragic ad infinitum.”",Game II,Americas,"['game.n.01', 'activity.n.01', 'east.n.01', 'rule.n.01', 'gathering.n.01', 'opportunity.n.01', 'form.v.01', 'combination.n.01', 'ancient.s.01', 'uncover.v.01', 'africa.n.01', 'rock.n.01', 'sculptural.a.01', 'popular.a.01', 'play.n.01', 'metaphor.n.01', 'center.n.01', 'meaning.n.01', 'idea.n.01', 'manner.n.01', 'procedure.n.01', 'sculpture.n.01', 'piece.n.01']","['game.n.01', 'open-ended.s.01', 'autobiography.n.01', 'procedure.n.01', 'conscious.s.01', 'trial_and_error.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/ua_peephole_03.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/ua_peephole_03-200x300.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/game-ii/,"['Cultural/13.048351648351648', 'Society/13.028571428571427', 'Individual_Personal/8.22857142857143']","['Cultural', 'Society', 'Individual_Personal']",34.3054945054945,"['Spirituality/6.514285714285714', 'Media/3.4571428571428573', 'Culture/3.314285714285714']","['Spirituality', 'Media', 'Culture']",13.285714285714285,"['Cultural/46.66336457659987', 'Individual_Personal/36.49075091575092', 'Society/31.496636696636706']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Society']",114.6507521889875,"['Arts/16.16495187818718', 'Spirituality/13.11648351648352', 'Culture/11.47997557997558']","['Arts', 'Spirituality', 'Culture']",40.76141097464628,1.0,0.6666666666666666
Marie Voignier,"Tourisme International was shot as the recording of a show on the scale of a country. In the urgency of perpetual travel, this tourist journey visits monuments, museums, institutions presented by North Korean guides whose voices we do not hear. Marie Voignier entirely redesigned the sound of each sequence in post-synchronization, making only the living experiences of footsteps and rustling of clothes audible, to create a new universe, disconnected from the official discourses. In this new decor, the artist attempts to re-appropriate the image she shot (frames and length were decided by the organizers), and gives another view of a country in perpetual representation of itself: a cinematographic representation that can be screened.  Interview in French with the artist about Tourisme International.","Marie Voignier was born in 1974 and lives in Paris. Her work presents a subtle criticism of the transitory status of fiction within the social and political fields. One could think of her work as a documentary practice when it could rather be considered as fiction, which, beyond its collective inscription finds itself sent to the heart of the intimate, in a movement of individuation. Working on these boundaries, the artist flushes out the erring ways of a collective imagination. For instance her first full-length film L’hypothèse du Mokélé-Mbembé (2012) follows the quest of a French zoologist who investigates pygmy stories about a prehistoric monster. For years, he has crossed the jungle back and forth looking for the unknown animal: the Mokélé-Mbembé.",Tourisme International,Europe,"['state.n.04', 'representation.n.01', 'interview.n.01', 'french.a.01', 'discourse.n.01', 'shoot.v.01', 'life.n.02', 'institution.n.01', 'universe.n.01', 'memorial.n.03', 'journey.n.01', 'sequence.n.01', 'voice.n.01', 'scale.n.01', 'sound.n.01', 'museum.n.01', 'frame.n.01', 'attempt.n.01', 'position.n.03', 'experience.n.01', 'make.v.03', 'image.n.01']","['tourism.n.01', 'propaganda.n.01', 'disconnect.v.02', 'rustle.n.01', 'north_korea.n.01', 'footfall.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/capture_decran_2014-05-22_a_16.42.31.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/capture_decran_2014-05-22_a_16.42.31-300x146.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/tourisme-international/,"['Society/6.808996851102114', 'Material_Physical/4.9409532750493845', 'Politics/1.0']","['Society', 'Material_Physical', 'Politics']",12.749950126151498,"['Economy/5.261988304093567', 'Land/2.6198830409356724', 'Activism/1.0']","['Economy', 'Land', 'Activism']",8.88187134502924,"['Individual_Personal/28.570451770451783', 'Cultural/26.82527472527473', 'Society/17.327862926547144']","['Individual_Personal', 'Cultural', 'Society']",72.72358942227366,"['Culture/13.772527472527475', 'Mind/10.400732600732603', 'Space/6.679487179487179']","['Culture', 'Mind', 'Space']",30.852747252747257,0.3333333333333333,0.0

Conrad Ruiz,"Conrad Ruiz loves to paint subjects related to the “boy zone”: video games, weapons, games, science fiction, fantasy, and special effects. He also often works at a very large scale to emphasize a connection to the tradition of history painting. Blockbuster (2011) was, at the time of its creation, the largest watercolor painting he had ever made. This commissioned piece combines his bombastic and playful style with a tribute to San Francisco’s thriving arts and culture scenes. It is a lively depiction of famous landmarks in the city, and a somewhat fanciful and lighthearted recapitulation of how a potential earthquake would shake things up in the ultimate “boy zone.”","Conrad Ruiz makes watercolor paintings of fantastic scenes. Bursts of color and energy sit behind flying figures and animals. Images become painted patterns, as rows of repeated objects and buildings’ striations verge on geometric abstraction. Ruiz’ identifies his work with the “ultimate boy zone”, and the connection is clear. His paintings are populated by explosions, giant sharks, and athletes.

Clare Rojas,"Rojas’s two pieces in the Kadist Collection—Untitled (four-legged…) and Untitled (Bird’s Eyes)—are representative of her pictorial style which uses bold colorful blocks of paint and female and animal characters. While Untitled (Bird’s Eyes) does not depict any actual women, it nevertheless alludes to gender roles and the power of the female gaze. Apparently playful, this scene of two animals has an ominous quality: A bird and a hedgehog confront at each other and the bird appears to be poking, even eating the hedgehog’s eye.","Trained in printmaking at the Rhode Island School of Design, Clare Rojas is a painter inspired in equal parts by cartoons, quilting, street, and folk art.

Charles Ray,"To make the well-known work All My Clothes (1973), the artist posed for 16 photographs, modeling every item of clothing in his wardrobe. An experiment in self-portraiture, it deftly touches on anthropology, identity construction, and art history. In its methodical, purported completeness, it pokes fun at Minimalism’s dogged adherence to comprehensive systems. Its quasi-scientific method of documentation calls into question the idea of art as purely aesthetic expression. It also says something about the essential consumerism that underlies the art market.","The Los Angeles–based artist Charles Ray disorients and disarms viewers of his work via experiments in perception and scale. In one of his best-known interventions, he arranged the fabrication of a painted aluminum replica of a toy fire truck, but at the size of an actual fire truck, and parked it outside the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York. Though playful, Ray’s work often disturbs assumed cultural notions. Family Romance (1993) is a fiberglass sculpture of a nuclear family. Mother, father, and two young children stand holding hands, naked and eerily scaled so that they are all the same height. While Ray’s subjects are varied, they consistently engage with deeply rooted assumptions about what is “correct” or “right” in order to investigate the power structures that underlie relationships.",All My Clothes,Americas,"['method.n.01', 'market.n.01', 'documentation.n.01', 'aesthetic.a.01', 'expression.n.01', 'construction.n.01', 'identity.n.01', 'idea.n.01', 'question.n.01', 'history.n.01', 'photograph.n.01']","['identity.n.02', 'system.n.07', 'pseudoscience.n.01', 'self-portrait.n.01', 'anthropology.n.01', 'consumerism.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/charles_ray_all_my_clothes.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/charles_ray_all_my_clothes-300x52.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/all-my-clothes/,"['Cultural/8.227539436827362', 'Individual_Personal/6.647263993316625', 'Material_Physical/5.5788961038961045']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Material_Physical']",20.45369953404009,"['Mind/5.6948830409356725', 'Physics/3.1800865800865803', 'Economy/1.9090909090909092']","['Mind', 'Physics', 'Economy']",10.784060530113162,"['Individual_Personal/23.879329004329016', 'Cultural/21.973024850966034', 'Society/7.657142857142857']","['Individual_Personal', 'Cultural', 'Society']",53.50949671243791,"['Arts/7.209640522875817', 'Values/6.00467032967033', 'Identity/5.575757575757575']","['Arts', 'Values', 'Identity']",18.790068428303723,0.6666666666666666,0.0
Chadwick Rantanen,"Telescopic Pole is an adjustable telescopic pole that extends vertically from floor to ceiling and is held up by its own internal pressure. The ends, protected by two, cut-open tennis balls, recall the legs of a walker. For Rantanen’s second solo exhibition at Jancar Jones Gallery, San Francisco in 2010, one pole was placed inside the gallery while the other was located outside. This visual echo both suggested reflection and called attention to the physical viewing conditions. The muffled poles seemed to connect the spaces, to hold them up and together, while the fixity of their positions was in tension with the idea of movement suggested by the allusion to a walking-aid.","Chadwick Rantanen is an emerging, Los Angeles-based artist.

Fabrice Hyber,"Drawing, which is the essential embodiment of Fabrice Hyber’s artistic thinking, is at the origin of all his works. The artist uses accumulation, hybridization and mutation to create constant shifts between extremely varied domains. Each work is just an intermediate, evolving stage of this “work in progress” that spreads like a proliferation of thought, establishing links and exchanges that then help to create other connections. The process is inspired by the way in which the cell systems grow in living organisms, with immigrant and feeding flows, reflecting the passion for science that motivates the artist, who trained as a mathematician.","In each of his self-portraits, Fabrice Hyber (he removed the last “t” in Hybert in 2004) is elusive. This has been expressed in the photo “C’est le moment de se préparer à de nouvelles expériences” (It’s time to prepare for new experiences) (1987), or when we look at the upside down, hanging by one foot in “Traduction, le plus gros savon du monde” (Translation, the biggest soap in the world) (1991). “I? am an alien! ” says the artist. “Games and shifts are the only things able to face any kind of fundamentalism. Trade, commerce, image and poetry are means of osmosis. Through them gradually you can set up all of the ways to increase life beyond death. It is necessary to mix time, upgrade products, and imagine that works die in order to be assimilated then revisited. A work is absolutely not precognitive but always from here” said Fabrice Hyber in conversation with Thierry Laurent. Fabrice Hyber was born in 1961 in Luçon, France.

Alban Hajdinaj,"Wash and Go (2001) is divided into two stages and operates like a slide show.

The images reveal a devastated city, dotted with scrappy buildings, and urban noises – each of who accompany this vision of abandonment.","Alban Hajdinaj creates parallel worlds, fictions from a chaotic context: his generation and his country.  His installations assemble objects, photos, videos and paintings: domestic objects (porcelains, figurines) are reactivated as ready-madescollaged together to generate narrative tension.

Loris Gréaud,"The acronym “CFL” stands for an existing light standard (Compact Fluorescent Light) as well as a standard nutrient (Cognitive Fooding Laboratory). “CFL” is a mobile laboratory for growth of watercress shoots which contain high levels of anthocyanin – a natural pigment used by fighter pilots to increase their visual acuity at night in order to achieve better responses to light stimuli. In the work Celador, a taste of illusion (2007), the viewer is invited to consume the plants – a candy with the flavor of illusion. “CFL,” which refers to a possibility of better viewing in the dark, was made alongside Dream machines which consists of light boxes to see with closed eyes. These inventions blend biochemistry, science fiction, and parapsychology. “The artist’s taste for fiction, scripts, playing with fears, fantasies and obsessions herein, exemplifies a quest for a work which only exists by rumors,” critic Marjolaine Lévy has stated.","Research by Loris Gréaud is pieced together in the exhibition space in effort to build a total work of art and a world view. “Cellar Door,” his solo exhibition held at the Palais de Tokyo in  2008, is constructed like a movie set, spanning across divergent processes and temporalities. Gréaud’s work, extracted from science fiction literature, technology, and science, questions immateriality as well as the real and the virtual. He is known to make references to Yves Klein in “The Merzball Pavilion” (2008), to spread the smell of the planet Mars in “Spirit” (2005), to remodel an apartment magnetic fields specialist in “Residents 1” (2005), to send messages in Morse code by light in “Limen” (2003), and create nanosculptures with “Untilted01” (2006).

Loris Gréaud,"This work refers to the “Dream Machines”, an experimental object invented by the painter and writer Brion Gysin and the scientist Ian Sommerville, and which is composed of a light bulb with light passing through slits in a rotating cylinder. Loris Gréaud revisits the structural mechanism; the light variations, following the frequency shift of the “Dream Machines”,, which is transcribed here by the undulations of the light produced by the filament lamps. Beyond this technological reference, the artist also quotes stories, legends, rumors about this invention in order to crystallize them in a contemporary technological object. The light frequency generates mental images, physiologically modifying the information transmitted to the brain via the optical nerve and psychologically modifying the state of consciousness of the spectator. These changes in vision need to be experienced in the entire space of the exhibition – as was the case during Silence Goes More Quickly When Played Backwards at Le Plateau, Paris, in 2005. Dream Machines, to be seen with eyes closed, was in parallel with another of his works in the Kadist collection, CFL, watercress shoots that the spectator was invited to consume in order to better perceive in the dark space.  The three lightboxes create a screen and the spectator’s mental images are projected on this surface. Gréaud removed the screen from its usual rationales as an optical device, to allow the gaze to enter the imaginary.","Research by Loris Gréaud is pieced together in the exhibition space in effort to build a total work of art and a world view. “Cellar Door,” his solo exhibition held at the Palais de Tokyo in  2008, is constructed like a movie set, spanning across divergent processes and temporalities. Gréaud’s work, extracted from science fiction literature, technology, and science, questions immateriality as well as the real and the virtual. He is known to make references to Yves Klein in “The Merzball Pavilion” (2008), to spread the smell of the planet Mars in “Spirit” (2005), to remodel an apartment magnetic fields specialist in “Residents 1” (2005), to send messages in Morse code by light in “Limen” (2003), and create nanosculptures with “Untilted01” (2006).

Felix Gmelin,"Ambiguous Gestures takes as its point of origin a film Gmelin discovered in his father’s archive. Filmed from a fixed point, it portrays his father in an intimate performance of body painting with a woman unknown to Felix Gmelin. The discovery of this footage was obviously disturbing. On the one hand there is an erotic encounter with someone who is not Gmelin’s mother; on the other hand the performance itself is strangely unerotic and unsensual. The performance clearly references the work of Klein and the Viennese actionists but has an Arcadian element divorced from the Viennese school. Two acts of painting take place; the mutual painting of bodies and the impression of those bodies on a series of canvases. Taking that as his own starting point, working from stills Felix Gmelin then painted his own paintings with the help also of an assistant, thus paralleling the process of his father. He wanted to focus on the painting aspect of the film rather than its erotic potential and draw a comparison between painting and film, further enhanced by the display of stills that forms part of the installation. The grisâtre quality of the paintings serves to highlight the intense colour of the film. By making what in some respects are conventional paintings from this most intimate of films, and painting found images, Gmelin neutralises its erotic charge, making the film ‘innocent, beautiful and affirmative’. While the film is ‘embarrassing in every possible sense’ to the artist, its conjunction with his paintings and the stills transforms it into another manifestation of a utopian project. Gmelin cleanses his father ‘s work literally and metaphorically, washing the film and creating paintings using rubber gloves and brushes.","With a degree in painting and inspired by so-called institutional criticism, Felix Gmelin is interested in the possibilities of painting as a form of resistance and its direct relation to a form of socio-political reality. He is frequently known to rework the experiences of his youth into his art. In a critical, yet personal investigation, he subtly unravels the complicated interweaving of self-development, socialization and emancipation with which he grew up in the late 1960s and 1970s. Gmelin’s first substantial work in which reproduction served as a productive impetus was Art Vandals (1996-1998), a series of 12 paintings and one object, modeled after examples of modern and contemporary artworks, all of which had been vandalized. His interest in degenerate art also falls within the interest of vandalism. The emptying of meaning is a consistent theme in his work, as a number of Gmelin’s paintings.Felix Gmelin was born in Heidelberg in 1962 and has lived in Stockholm, Sweden, since he was nine.",Ambiguous Gestures,Europe,"['father.n.01', 'movie.n.01', 'performance.n.01', 'hand.n.01', 'body.n.01', 'mother.n.01', 'unknown.a.01', 'film.v.01', 'pull.v.01', 'conventional.a.01', 'brush.n.06', 'component.n.01', 'school.n.01', 'display.n.01', 'footage.n.01', 'aspect.n.01', 'quality.n.01', 'gesture.n.01', 'beginning.n.04', 'impression.n.01', 'woman.n.01', 'sense.n.01', 'undertaking.n.01', 'procedure.n.01']","['erotic.s.01', 'cleanse.v.02', 'recreate.v.04', 'utopian.a.02', 'father.n.01', 'still.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/vg-gmelf-00021.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/vg-gmelf-00021-238x300.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/ambiguous-gestures/,"['Cultural/3.2540849673202614', 'Individual_Personal/1.9230769230769231']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal']",5.177161890397184,"['Familial/1.9230769230769231', 'Design/1.5555555555555556', 'Media/0.875']","['Familial', 'Design', 'Media']",4.353632478632479,"['Individual_Personal/25.82610296480266', 'Cultural/20.549511599511607', 'Society/14.225345225809626']","['Individual_Personal', 'Cultural', 'Society']",60.600959790123895,"['Values/6.65845004668534', 'Media/6.554151404151405', 'Familial/6.392185592185593']","['Values', 'Media', 'Familial']",19.604787043022338,0.8,0.6666666666666666
Felix Gmelin,"In Untitled (after Paul Schultze Nuremberg’s Kunst) (2006), from a larger series of diptychs, Gmelin addresses the notion of entartete kunst (“Degenerate Art”). Each diptych juxtaposes a portrait of a person considered to be mentally handicapped with a painting that was branded by the Nazi regime as degenerate. Gmelin’s source for these images is Kunst und Rasse (“Art and Race”), a book by Paul Schultze Naumburg published in 1928. Naumburg, one of Hitler’s architects, was a member of the Nazi party and became director of the Weimar Kunsthochschule in 1930. In this capacity he organized an exhibition of 70 ‘degenerate’ artworks from the Weimar Castle Museum. His book was something of a groundbreaker for the Nazi position on modernism. In the book he juxtaposed contemporary works of art with clinical photographs of people with medical deformities. He thus defined the art as pathological. Working from black and white reproductions from the original book, Gmelin himself makes another reproduction in paint. Just as the original thesis, that modern artists were equivalent to mentally handicapped people, is a distortion of the truth, Gemiln distorts his images one stage further. The grey painting, which represents the medically deformed person, is executed in a painterly way. Thus he has rendered a mentally handicapped person in a manner that in the 1920s and 1930s would have demonstrated a modern artist’s degeneracy and declares her as a subject fit for art.  Paradoxically, he has disguised the mental abnormality of the person by juxtaposing the image with an interpretation of a modernist work leaving the viewer, for a moment, wondering which image was sourced from a painting and which from a photograph of a living person. The diptych is thus deeply ironic as well as poignant. But by treating the two images in a similar, painterly way, Gmelin also neutralizes the impact that the juxtaposition of the two images has when viewed on the page of the book. Gmelin thus offers a comment on how in our present culture art no longer has the capacity to shock; that anything goes. Transgression is more or less a thing of the past.","With a degree in painting and inspired by so-called institutional criticism, Felix Gmelin is interested in the possibilities of painting as a form of resistance and its direct relation to a form of socio-political reality.

Omer Fast,"This work is based on a temporal loop in which the stories of several duets coexist and interfere with each other. The narrative articulates itself around four key moments or four neighboring apartments that the viewer discovers progressively: an air stewardess having an argument with her unemployed husband, and old lady telling old stories that no longer interest her caregiver, a black woman who is accused of stealing jewelry just when a newcomer, of Arab origin, moves into the apartment block. The narration itself is based on a void or non-event, however its dialogues refer to subjects such as terrorism or iimmigration. Even if the work remains deliberately vague in its global intention, the clash between personal stories and fictional characters of different origins and generations operates as metaphor of our contemporary society.","In his videos and installations, Omer Fast links and merges personal stories, collective history reality and fiction as well as experience and one’s making of it. Fast is interested in different types of discourse carried out in contemporary political and social events. In the work CNN concatenated (2002), for instance, an American journalist’s speech is modified to deliver a different meaning. Omer Fast was born in 1972 in Jerusalem, Israel.

Jun Nguyen Hatsushiba,"Filmed underwater, this is the third video in Nguyen-Hatsushiba’s “Memorial Project” series which began in 2001. The title already implies the cultural complexities about to be ironically unravelled: Ho Chi Minh is parodied and Okinawa (where this was filmed) was a battle site in Japan during World War II which then became an American training base during the Vietnam War. To a remix of James Bond movie tracks composed by Quoc Bao, no less than thirty divers in wet suits and full gear advance against the water resistance armed with cartridges of color. They attack trestles with blank canvases on which they attempt to paint a yellow star but, after a showering of digital white stars likened to the American flag (presumably alluding to Christmassy snow), they find themselves uncontrollably portraying actors who played in Vietnam-related films like Marlon Brando, Michael Cimino, Robert De Niro… which then, end up leading to collapse and dissolving. Water creates a parallel world, symbolic of universal consciousness, which allows for the slow contemplation of these potentially alienating cultural transmissions. Nguyen-Hatsushiba’s dramatized soft critique is across the board, from the sheer weight of Vietnamese tradition on one hand, to America’s geo-political and cultural hegemony on the other, as well as the way war is represented in the media and in cinema (Vietnam was one of the first conflicts to have broad coverage).","Jun Nguyen-Hatsushiba initially trained as a painter in the United States and references to the act of paint easel painting and are regularly present in his videos. Since 2001, he is world renowned for his series of underwater videos, called “Memorial Project”, which revisit the history and culture of Vietnam, and its relations with the United States. Although the actual filming has an actual dangerous side for the artist and the actors, as a direct connection with Vietnamese boat people, they have a certain dream-like quality due to the slow motion in the liquid environment. typical national tropes which are integrated count rickshaws, rice picking, water puppets and dragons, the yellow star on the flag but these are generally intermingled and confused by overriding American cultural references. Through running performances across cities around the world, titled Breathing is Free: 12,756.3, Jun Nguyen-Hatsushiba pursues his humanistic artistic action denouncing global refugee crisis.

Allora & Calzadilla,"Vieques is an island off the mainland of Puerto Rico used by the U.S Navy and NATO forces as military testing ground as from the 1940s. Civil disobedience and active protest movements initiated by local inhabitants and an international support network led to the end of the bombings and progressive demilitarization in 2002. Allora & Calzadilla became involved in the defense of this cause in 2000 and made a series of works relating to the story of this island. This video demonstrates the beginning of their ongoing interest in the interplay between militarism and sound. In Returning A Sound, Homar, the motorcycle driver and activist, drives around the island as if reclaiming the territory. The muffler was altered so it no longer silenced the noise and became a musical instrument instead, like a trumpet to announce decontamination and recovery in echo to the terrible exploding sounds that had shaped the lives of the Vieques inhabitants for 60 years.  “As artists, we became interested in questions related to the sonic violence that marked this space, as it was exposed to earsplitting detonations up to 250 days out of the year. The first work we made in that regard was Returning A Sound, which we filmed just after the military lands were semi-opened to the public in 2003.” Guillermo Calzadilla, quoted in Carlo Motta, “Allora & Calzadilla”, BOMB magazine, 109, Autumn 2009.","Jennifer Allora and Guillermo Calzadilla comprise the artistic duo Allora & Calzadilla.

Philip-Lorca diCorcia,,"The works of Philip-Lorca diCorcia oscillate between two possible definitions of photography – from a recording system in the tradition of documentary and a system of representation in the tradition of fiction. The use of different contradictory light sources in the same picture is symptomatic of his staging of reality. In Napoli 1996 a man walking down the street in broad daylight is fictionalized by the flash of the camera. Related to the world of cinema in the case of  “Hollywood” (1990-1992), fashion in the series “W” (1997-2000), and advertising, the photographer questions the representation of reality, between the utopia of transparency and necessary construction. “I try to criticize the beast I work with. This monster of whom I share my bed with is about me,” the artist says. His photographs are a space alien in the world of the viewer because of the absorbance of characters. In “Mario” (1978), a man leaning in front of a refrigerator is estranged to the outside world, far from the viewer, denying his/her presence. Immobility is also a constant in the artist’s work. Psychological tension and dramatical equilibrium structure his photographs like enigmas or like “moments suspended in narratives that unfold,” as critic Peter Galassi suggests.Phillip-Lorca diCorcia was born in 1951 in Hartford, Connecticut, USA.",New York City,Americas,[],"['immobility.n.02', 'narrative.s.01', 'stagy.s.01', 'tension.n.03', 'cinematic.a.01', 'photography.n.02']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/dicorcia_-_ny_city.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/dicorcia_-_ny_city-300x197.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/new-york-city/,"['Material_Physical/2.4571428571428573', 'Individual_Personal/1.6', 'Cultural/1.0']","['Material_Physical', 'Individual_Personal', 'Cultural']",5.057142857142857,"['Arts/1.0', 'Time/0.8571428571428571', 'Identity/0.8']","['Arts', 'Time', 'Identity']",2.6571428571428575,[],[],0.0,[],[],0.0,,

Cinthia Marcelle,"Cinthia Marcelle’s video work Automóvel (2012) re-edits the mundane rhythms of automotive traffic into a highly compelling and seemingly choreographed meditation on sequence, motion, and time. Shot from an aerial vantage, the camera tracks the daily commute on a small stretch of concrete highway. The camera films the traffic below in short five-second excerpts before blacking out; time begins to collapse as the video shifts between scene, and the hours compress into minutes as daylight quickly turns into night. An uninterrupted soundtrack of car sounds plays continuously throughout, both at play with the images on screen and disjointed from the video’s repeated stops and starts. The vehicles begin to resemble more abstracted forms of shape and color: flattened yet mobile, these synchronous moving blocks form an intricate dance of mechanized motion. Representing the constant flow of vehicles on a two-way urban street, Automóvel focuses on the pace of life on any normal working day, and Marcelle’s video offers a playful reimagining of a traffic jam as a symphonic composition of movement and sound. Despite its frequent visual humor, however, Marcelle also considers the struggles of a modern-day labor force and the inexorable cost of “working” in relation to time and resources. Automóvel, by extension, is also a work about stasis and the experience of being caught in an intermediate space, always in transit to an indeterminate destination that never arrives.","Cinthia Marcelle produces video works that address the mundane and attempt to make sense out of everyday chaos. In her practice, commonplace rhythms, patterns and events are an infinite resource of meaning. Her work frequently reimagines everyday “movements” such as traffic as highly formal and sequenced orchestrations. Through a time-intensive and mathematically precise editing process, she re-choreographs disordered movement, using video and photography to document the effects that her interventions have on the usual order of things. Her compositions are at once satirical and lighthearted, and her actions create situations that challenge our notions of conventional behavior by introducing humorous coincidences and connections. Marcelle’s work has been part of significant group exhibitions including New Museum Triennial, New York (2012),Tate Modern Level2, London (2012) and 29ª Bienal de São Paulo (2010). Her solo exhibitions include Pinchuk Art Center, Kiev (2011), Galeria Vermelho, São Paulo (2011), Camberwell College of Arts, London (2009) and Sprovieri Gallery, London (2009).",Automóvel,Americas,"['sound.n.01', 'video.n.01', 'camera.n.01', 'time.n.01', 'dance.n.01', 'block.n.01', 'rhythm.n.01', 'struggle.n.01', 'playful.a.01', 'shift.n.01', 'short.a.01', 'night.n.01', 'changeless.s.02', 'sequence.n.01', 'day.n.01', 'daily.s.01', 'relation.n.01', 'play.n.01', 'screen.n.01', 'shooting.n.01', 'urban.a.01', 'color.n.01', 'street.n.01', 'shape.n.01', 'composition.n.01']","['conveyance.n.03', 'motion.n.03', 'everyday.s.01', 'urban.a.01', 'labor.n.02', 'everyday.s.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/04.cinthia_marcelle_-_automovel_2012_-_conjunto.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/04.cinthia_marcelle_-_automovel_2012_-_conjunto-212x300.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/automovel/,"['Cultural/8.90704589528119', 'Politics/7.1803921568627445', 'Society/6.859426847662141']","['Cultural', 'Politics', 'Society']",22.946864899806076,"['Economy/3.3927601809954746', 'Geopolitics/3.2026143790849675', 'Time/2.9333333333333336']","['Economy', 'Geopolitics', 'Time']",9.528707893413776,"['Cultural/19.460784313725497', 'Material_Physical/13.187249351955236', 'Society/11.374114774114776']","['Cultural', 'Material_Physical', 'Society']",44.022148439795515,"['Arts/9.08340874811463', 'Time/5.8256606138959075', 'Economy/3.9410256410256412']","['Arts', 'Time', 'Economy']",18.85009500303618,0.6666666666666666,0.6666666666666666
Collier Schorr,"In the Collage II (Marie) (2013), Shorr seems to have an ostensibly clear subject, a female subject identified in the work’s title as “Marie,” a slim but athletic woman with brown hair pictured reclining atop a brilliantly white sheet draped against a marbled tan-and-white backdrop. Although photographed topless, Marie is depicted in slightly contorted poses that emphasize the curves of her figure while also obstructing the viewer’s gaze. Printed on high gloss paper, Marie’s portrait has the polished veneer of magazine spread, and the two portraits on display offer different vantages of the same subject. But Schorr subverts expectations: instead of framing the images flat, Schorr loosely rolls the two prints, displaying them in a clear vitrine mounted on top of a white rectangular pedestal. The display raises questions about modes of spectatorship that objectify female bodies. At the same time, Schorr activates a physicality through these portraits that belies the conventional flatness of photography. By encouraging her audience to examine her vitrine from all sides, Schorr engagers her viewer in a more complex and multi-faced mode of viewership and, by extension, allows her portraits to be seen with a kind of dimensionality closer to real life.","Collier Schorr photographs communities of people, from high school wresters in her native New York to teenagers in the German countryside clad in American military uniforms. Her work displays an almost anthropological curiosity, and in documenting her subjects, she tries to find the idiosyncratic details through which people organize into “tribal” relationships with one another. Her images, by extension, blend photographic realism with elements of fiction and fantasy as a means of representing the various ways these tribes identify themselves. Schoor’s work also investigates gender and the ways in which subjects use visual cues and embodied signs to both inhabit and subvert assumed gender expectations.",In the Collage II (Marie),Americas,"['portrayal.n.01', 'female.a.01', 'display.n.01', 'subject.n.01', 'white.a.01', 'manner.n.01', 'spectator.n.01', 'hair.n.01', 'analyze.v.01', 'magazine.n.01', 'airs.n.01', 'backdrop.n.01', 'sheet.n.01', 'gaze.n.01', 'conventional.a.01', 'print.v.01', 'picture.v.02', 'print.n.01', 'audience.n.01', 'complex.a.01', 'collage.n.01', 'paper.n.01', 'real.a.01', 'photography.n.01', 'woman.n.01']","['objectification.n.01', 'body.n.01', 'ad.n.01', 'animalism.n.02', 'spectator.n.01', 'female.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/img_collier_schorr_in_the_collage_ii_marie.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/img_collier_schorr_in_the_collage_ii_marie-225x300.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/collage-marie/,"['Material_Physical/9.817948717948719', 'Society/2.6', 'Cultural/1.6198830409356724']","['Material_Physical', 'Society', 'Cultural']",14.03783175888439,"['Space/6.346153846153846', 'Environmental/1.7025641025641027', 'Body/1.0']","['Space', 'Environmental', 'Body']",9.048717948717949,"['Cultural/17.527764690925956', 'Individual_Personal/3.442105263157895', 'Material_Physical/3.4233766233766234']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Material_Physical']",24.393246577460474,"['Media/7.7249828001375995', 'Arts/5.1042311661506705', 'Body/1.8']","['Media', 'Arts', 'Body']",14.62921396628827,0.6666666666666666,0.3333333333333333
Daniel Crooks,"The Illusion of Everything (2014) follows an unseen pedestrian as he navigates the Australian city of Melbourne’s dense and intricate network of laneways. The video begins with the pedestrian traversing a seemingly idyllic ivy lined stone and concrete thoroughfare. As his pace begins to accelerate, the camera follows him with greater urgency, slowly settling and become stable again as his pace decelerates. At various moments, side alleys and apertures appear, inviting the pedestrian to take a turn. But before he can, the camera fades out, dissolving to the image of yet another laneway, near identical to the last. The pedestrian continues his forward march again, traversing the next lane until the fade out/dissolve repeats itself again. The sky overhead begins to transition from day to night as the video progresses, and with each dissolve, time itself seems to fade away. The Illusion of Everything is an intricate work of montage: in order to produce the work, Daniel Crooks filmed nearly 200 laneways throughout Melbourne at various points throughout the day and evening hours, finally editing them into a “singular whole, or new whole”. Crooks plays on durational aesthetics creates an almost meditative and transfixing experience of movement, but he also disorients his viewers by disallowing any obvious indicators of real-life places. By making us aware of the elemental mechanics of how video manipulates our sense of space and time, Crooks effectively gives us keen insight into how moving images, at their best, effectively disorient and transcend our perceptual experiences of inhabiting a body.","Daniel Crooks works primarily with video and moving images. Originally trained in animation, he works with time and space as materials and always-evolving digital technology to create complex structures that manipulate and challenge viewers’ perceptions of spatial and temporal dimensions. The intricate and technical aspects of his work often contrast with the commonality of the subject matter, and his videos depict seemingly mundane acts such as walking through a laneway or back alley as a point of departure for more trenchant investigations into how image-based cultures both inform and distort our perceptual experiences of inhabiting our bodies. Crooks received his Bachelor of Graphic Design from Auckland Institute of Technology and his Graduate Diploma of Animation from Victorian College of the Arts School of Film and TV in Melbourne. He has exhibited his work extensively in notable venues internationally, including the Tate Modern in London (2008).",The Illusion of Everything,Asia,"['illusion.n.01', 'day.n.01', 'camera.n.01', 'experience.n.01', 'brooding.s.01', 'sky.n.01', 'aesthetics.n.01', 'network.n.01', 'night.n.01', 'time.n.01', 'rock.n.01', 'viewing_audience.n.01', 'video.n.01', 'produce.v.01', 'collage.n.01', 'moment.n.01', 'image.n.01', 'sense.n.01', 'motion.n.03', 'city.n.01', 'body.n.01', 'space.n.01']","['moviemaking.n.01', 'motion.n.06', 'suburb.n.01', 'everyday.s.01', 'percept.n.01', 'delusion.n.03']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/image_daniel_crooks_the_illusion_of_everything_low_rez.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/image_daniel_crooks_the_illusion_of_everything_low_rez-300x169.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/illusion-everything/,"['Politics/7.52625558995528', 'Individual_Personal/6.070604395604395', 'Cultural/5.854298642533936']","['Politics', 'Individual_Personal', 'Cultural']",19.451158628093612,"['Geopolitics/4.306372549019607', 'Time/2.7904761904761903', 'Mind/2.3956043956043955']","['Geopolitics', 'Time', 'Mind']",9.492453135100194,"['Material_Physical/30.6461016108075', 'Cultural/20.58284540536863', 'Individual_Personal/17.51316110789795']","['Material_Physical', 'Cultural', 'Individual_Personal']",68.74210812407408,"['Space/15.204725992961288', 'Body/6.093040293040293', 'Time/5.935464535464536']","['Space', 'Body', 'Time']",27.23323082146612,0.6666666666666666,0.3333333333333333
Daria Martin,"In keeping with her mythological proclivity, Minotaur (2009) casts a new light on an old narrative. The film takes the ancient Greek story of the half-man, half-bull as its title subject, but at its core, Minotaur is an homage to pioneering modern dancer and choreographer, Anna Halprin. Along with Trisha Brown, Simone Forti, and Yvonne Rainer, Halprin’s fearless and lifelong dance practice paved the way for the evolution of modern and contemporary dance as we understand it today. Growing up with her as a neighbor, Halprin’s life and work has been a leading influence in many of Martin’s films, particularly resonant in her relationship to choreography, and the sensuality of the human body. As such, Minotaur traces three artists’ interpretations of the same legend: Martin’s documentation of Halprin’s erotic interpretation of Auguste Rodin’s sculpture of the Minotaur capturing a nymph—sculpture within dance within film. Extending this sense of accumulating and multiplying points of view, through Martin’s perspective we watch Halprin observing the dancers, the dancers revitalizing Rodin’s sculpture, and Rodin interpreting mythology.","A number of Daria Martin’s films explore the relationship between humans and machines and make reference to modernist art, whether through the work of the Bauhuas (Schlemmer), Surrealism (Giacometti’s Palace at 4 AM) or American art of the 1960s and 1970s. Her films involve performance and many are shown as 16mm projections – assembling memories, reveries, scholarly research, and imported citations drawn from a wide range of sources including early twentieth century painting, sculpture, fashion, stage, and dance productions. “I came to the medium of film because of its open potential,” writes Daria Martin, “Its invitation to travel through time and space within an imagined world.” The artist values the contradictions of the medium of film, in particular the tension between the private fantasy it stimulates and the public physicality on which it depends.

Elena Damiani,"Intersticio (Interstice, 2014) traces the topography of a non-specific site, an in-between zone. The video presents a panoramic view of two territories of a shifting and unresolved character, composed out of segmented events that visually intersect at a shared horizon point. Over the images, a fragmented and ambiguous poetic narration describes, by means of images found in digital archives, a hybrid site that permutes the representation of nature through its fusion of source material. The sense of permanent wandering designates an excursion with no precise destination, a mental place of fractured limits with an amplitude larger than any physical location. This trajectory appears to be dictated by the circumstances of an open field, where concrete places are now only points along a route, and the in-between moments that mark a continuous state of transition are the ultimate destination. With Intersticio, Damiani presents a journey to a territory comparable to contemporary space—a world so ample that the spatial and temporal coordinates essential to historicity fade, throwing our impressions of reality into question.","Transforming found materials into collages, sculptures, videos, and installations, Elena Damiani critically addresses our understanding of the present via the potentiality of images from the past. She is interested in revising subjects such as geology, archaeology, and cartography—by reworking materials such as books, photographs, video footage, and public records—in order to stage fictions where multiple topographies and times unfold together, hovering between an indeterminate past and present. She aims to explore the ways in which specific materials can be staged as incomplete and ambiguous when extracted from their contexts, then recomposed into works that point out the manipulability of cultural objects and information, thereby forming new memory paths and connections.",Intersticio,Americas,"['district.n.01', 'field.n.01', 'passage.n.01', 'journey.n.01', 'location.n.01', 'digital.a.01', 'poetic.a.01', 'physical.a.01', 'beginning.n.04', 'impression.n.01', 'event.n.01', 'moment.n.01', 'image.n.01', 'representation.n.01', 'contemporary.s.01', 'nature.n.01', 'sense.n.01', 'position.n.03', 'fictional_character.n.01', 'world.n.03', 'question.n.01', 'material.n.01', 'narrative.n.01', 'video.n.01']","['picture.n.01', 'landscape.n.01', 'geology.n.01', 'archeology.n.01', 'mapmaking.n.01', 'culture.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/intersticio_06_100dpi.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/intersticio_06_100dpi-300x169.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/intersticio/,"['Cultural/11.652697921273772', 'Material_Physical/8.457067570111048', 'Society/3.797979797979798']","['Cultural', 'Material_Physical', 'Society']",23.90774528936462,"['Physics/4.83888575192923', 'Language/3.123809523809524', 'Geopolitics/2.7272727272727275']","['Physics', 'Language', 'Geopolitics']",10.689968003011483,"['Individual_Personal/29.47937944408534', 'Material_Physical/29.298155078495643', 'Cultural/25.26976928300458']","['Individual_Personal', 'Material_Physical', 'Cultural']",84.04730380558556,"['Land/13.227747252747253', 'Mind/12.355483731954322', 'Culture/10.961538461538462']","['Land', 'Mind', 'Culture']",36.54476944624004,0.6666666666666666,0.0
Elena Damiani,"The unstable transparency of the prints on silk chiffon is relative to the light and the viewer’s position, varying continually as we move around them. As apparitions or ghosts, the images portrayed appear or vanish in the space as fade-out recollections of a distant landscape. Hence, these impressions appear as oscillatory surfaces that fluctuate between presence and absence and contingent objects that shift as a result of what surrounds them.  The viewer struggles to grasp at once to the totality of the image, which keeps fusing with the space in the background. As a result, in Elena Damiani´s works function as constant reminders that it is only through the eyes of the present that we can catch a glimpse of the past and that both realms -virtual and physical- merge constantly in the act of remembrance.","Transforming found materials into collages, sculptures, videos, and installations, Elena Damiani critically addresses our understanding of the present via the potentiality of images from the past.

Anna Boghiguian,"In the painting called “The Consciousness of Memory, Time, and Guilt” as in many of her recent works, the body is fragmented. The brain, the ear, the eyes, these body parts that put us in relation with the other and link the visible to the invisible, remain isolated. Whereas the skulls are joined by lines evoking rivers. She often used images of the Ganga and of the Nile, two rivers burdened with history. The words “consciousness, memory, guilt, time, collective” create a new level of connections. One can notice an ear, which could link to the inside and the outside of the body while referring to the aspect of sound, the noise of the world we are part of. Anna Boghighian constructs an eminently personal space inhabited by her story but nevertheless aware of the world and the transformations and mutations at stake.","Anna Boghighian was born in Cairo in 1946. She lives and works between Cairo, India and Europe.  Anna Boghighian makes drawings and paintings of individuals and urban spaces as well as being a writer and a poet. Her artistic process can be seen as an attempt to make  a cartography of the world. According to her, individuals are conditioned by the environment that surrounds them, and the “self “ by the walls build by cultural, religious or political conditioning. She constantly travels in order to abolish frontiers, creating wherever she is, but always ending up returning to her hometown Cairo. In the 1960s, she composed music using the sounds of the city that she then adapted into a painting. Her paintings always present dense compositions to which she sometimes associates some of her writings. Her narratives mix personal stories and politics, ranging from the past to the present, deconstructing reality to create a mythological aspect, depicting a world in movement, in constant transformation.","The Consciousness of Memory, Time and Guilt",Middle East & Africa,"['river.n.01', 'consciousness.n.01', 'body.n.01', 'memory.n.01', 'transformation.n.01', 'invisible.a.01', 'connection.n.01', 'eyes.n.01', 'time.n.01', 'aspect.n.01', 'degree.n.01', 'relation.n.01', 'visible.a.01', 'line.n.01', 'corporate.s.03', 'sound.n.01', 'personal.a.01', 'narrative.n.01', 'history.n.01', 'space.n.01']","['consciousness.n.01', 'body.n.01', 'sense.n.03', 'memory.n.01', 'nature.n.01', 'percept.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/ab_the_consciousness_of_memory_time_and_guilt_2014_mixed_media_on_canvas_100x100cm_2.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/ab_the_consciousness_of_memory_time_and_guilt_2014_mixed_media_on_canvas_100x100cm_2-200x300.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/consciousness-memory-time/,"['Material_Physical/13.05604395604396', 'Individual_Personal/11.932385261797027', 'Cultural/8.061538461538463']","['Material_Physical', 'Individual_Personal', 'Cultural']",33.04996767937945,"['Space/6.346153846153846', 'Mind/5.87524240465417', 'Culture/4.615384615384616']","['Space', 'Mind', 'Culture']",16.836780866192633,"['Material_Physical/17.9968808968809', 'Individual_Personal/14.17170150111327', 'Cultural/5.93986013986014']","['Material_Physical', 'Individual_Personal', 'Cultural']",38.10844253785431,"['Space/7.235042735042734', 'Time/6.058541458541458', 'Mind/5.0796380090497735']","['Space', 'Time', 'Mind']",18.373222202633965,1.0,0.6666666666666666
Carey Young,"“Product Recall” is a video perfomative pun on the action recalling memories in the form of a psychoanalytic session and the recall of faulty products from multinational corporations. Young enters a practicing psychoanalyst room and begins a session. Dressed in corporate business attire, Young encompasses both the corporation and individual. The psychoanalyst opens the discussion by asking her how she feels. The exchange turns into a game of questions and answers whence the psychoanalysis asks Young to guess the corporations of the slogans that he recites, which many refer to sport corporation branding of “inspiration” and “imagination”. In Young’s failure to recall many brands, the audience is urged to question whether the psychoanalysis’s task is for Young to recall or forget the slogans. Through demonstrating that while branding is forgettable, the artist nonetheless highlights the omnipresence and power of multinationals in the landscape of our society. In the style of a documentary, this fictitious video performance is an unscripted play on subconscious memory and conscious intellectual emancipation. Young’s “Product Recall” is a shrewd and challenging analysis of collective and individual memory in the face of corporate oppression.  Actor: Morgan Deare  Camera: Peter Emery  Sound: Dave Hunt","Carey Young’s (b. Lusaka, Zambia, 1970) practice centers on the ethics of business and legal practice, motivated from having spent her early professional career in this context, to question society and politics. Young parodies and analyses the corporate business and legal world to expose its influence on contemporary society. The subject of law —that which is central to the structure of the international community — is a subject rarely explored in the contemporary art milieu. In exploring law as an artistic medium to address questions of the sublime and the void, Young traverses themes of the autonomous body, law and fiction and the power of law on society to highlight the danger of corporate influence in the institute and autonomous thinking.",Product Recall,Europe,"['remember.v.01', 'memory.n.01', 'documentary.n.01', 'imagination.n.01', 'exchange.n.01', 'actor.n.01', 'audience.n.01', 'video.n.01', 'game.n.01', 'play.n.01', 'corporate.s.03', 'individual.a.01', 'sound.n.01', 'person.n.01', 'society.n.01', 'action.n.01', 'power.n.01', 'performance.n.01', 'manner.n.01', 'undertaking.n.01', 'camera.n.01', 'question.n.01', 'landscape.n.01', 'form.n.01']","['corporation.n.01', 'multinational.s.01', 'ad.n.01', 'subconscious_mind.n.01', 'power.n.01', 'capitalism.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/CY-12-V-Christine_Sullivan_site.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/CY-12-V-Christine_Sullivan_site-300x194.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/product-recall/,"['Individual_Personal/5.218181818181818', 'Society/2.8333333333333335', 'Politics/2.511655011655012']","['Individual_Personal', 'Society', 'Politics']",10.563170163170163,"['Mind/3.618181818181818', 'Economy/2.8333333333333335', 'Power/2.511655011655012']","['Mind', 'Economy', 'Power']",8.963170163170163,"['Cultural/28.131367162249525', 'Society/21.153266178266186', 'Politics/21.003718503718513']","['Cultural', 'Society', 'Politics']",70.28835184423423,"['Power/9.76879786879787', 'Arts/7.506011635423399', 'Culture/7.072527472527472']","['Power', 'Arts', 'Culture']",24.347336976748743,0.6666666666666666,0.3333333333333333
Igor Grubic,"The installation “East Side Story” is based on events that took place in the streets of Belgrade in 2001 and Zagreb in 2002, during the Gay Pride demonstrations, where the participants were the victims of verbal and physical injury by neo-Nazi groups and other citizens. This work is composed of two projections: the first uses television images of the demonstrations while the second is the reconstitution of the events performed by dancers. This piece witnesses nationalism at work in society, aiming particularly at the “internal enemy that sexual minorities might represent”.  The use of performance and dance symbolizes creative freedom as well as the possibility to free the body from the public space. The performer’s body sends a signal in the public space in a society lacking social solidarity. This is a counter- monument or a monument of extreme fragility that reactivates repressed images. Aware that art produces hardly any political effects, Grubic keeps on questioning the power of symbolic gestures. According to him this work, full of emotions and intensity, is an aesthetic act of resistance.","Igor Grubic was born in Zagreb in 1969 where he lives and works.  Having started his carrier as an activist artist, Igor Grubic became known in 1998 through an action made in tribute to the group RED PERISTYL that had painted in red, the floor in front of Diocletian’s Palace in Split as a provocative gesture against totalitarism. Thirty years later, he painted the same place in black so as to draw attention to the reappearance of fascist and nationalistic ideologies within the different countries of what was called the Communist Bloc. Since then he has performed symbolic actions in the public space recalling May 68 political, as well as anti-fascist, values. His belief in the necessity of individual action is strong. In order to address social and political topics, he prefers using the transgressive power of poetic language rather than critical discourse.

Dineo Seshee Bopape,"Interested in the collection of object and their potential to evoke various emotional reactions in the audience, Bopape’s “Why do you call me when you know I can’t answer the phone” is an invitation into the limitless netherworld of the unsaid and unspoken. Exploring the metaphysical landscape of secrets, lies and psychosexual ambivalence, this work is an attempt to create a site for contemplation. The video ventures to provoke a rhythmic trance through transporting the mind into a distant illusionary world constructed by vignettes of fractured spaces. Bopape interrogates the notion of space within vide through a celestial journey to a contemporary sublime disturbed by constant movement and disruption. Through employing images and sound that are loud and dissonant and displaced Bopape isolates her references creating a sense of awe, anxiety and dysphoria within the chaos. “Why do you call me when you know I can’t answer the phone” challenges the viewers understanding and familiarity to contemporary objects, animals and landscapes.  “My work is a search through a minefield of metaphors in spaces: spaces of memory and of the present, spaces of the real and the imagined, the hidden and revealed. It is an attempt to conceal and mask, whilst simultaneously to peel away the husk and layers that crust over secretive stories embedded in objects and in people.”  – Dineo Seshee Bopape","Dineo Seshee Bopape (b. Polokwane, South Africa, 1981) is known for her playful and experimental video works and installations of found objects. Through weaving together a variety of media, from video and installation to drawing, painting and performance Bopape’s practice focuses on the performative aspects of culture. Bopape engages the viewer with the explicit questioning of political and social positioning’s of the self and other. Taken from her own experience, Bopape traverses themes of sex, gender, race in her dense and chaotic installations of brightly colored objects, often accompanied by plastic bags. Bopape’s installations refuse and calls attention to consumerist culture and waste to provoke an ethical response by the audience in positioning themselves within this challenged environmental landscape.",Why do you call me when you know i can’t answer the phone,Middle East & Africa,"['telephone.n.01', 'space.n.01', 'attempt.n.01', 'object.n.01', 'contemporary.s.01', 'landscape.n.01', 'mind.n.01', 'potential.a.01', 'changeless.s.02', 'animal.n.01', 'journey.n.01', 'audience.n.01', 'viewing_audience.n.01', 'layer.n.01', 'metaphor.n.01', 'sound.n.01', 'real.a.01', 'impression.n.01', 'construct.v.01', 'mention.n.01', 'sense.n.01', 'memory.n.01', 'motion.n.03', 'people.n.01', 'make.v.03']","['metaphysics.n.01', 'object.n.01', 'dreamlike.s.01', 'phantasmagoric.s.01', 'psychological.s.01', 'disagreement.n.01', 'chaos.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/bopape.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/bopape-300x202.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/why-do-you-call-me/,"['Cultural/9.38654970760234', 'Individual_Personal/2.8473684210526313', 'Society/1.6040100250626566']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Society']",13.837928153717627,"['Arts/4.930994152046783', 'Fantasy/2.0', 'Mind/1.9473684210526314']","['Arts', 'Fantasy', 'Mind']",8.878362573099414,"['Cultural/24.771148459383767', 'Society/22.811679273598788', 'Individual_Personal/19.958175158175166']","['Cultural', 'Society', 'Individual_Personal']",67.54100289115772,"['Mind/8.182595182595183', 'Economy/6.599835561755067', 'Culture/6.2725274725274724']","['Mind', 'Economy', 'Culture']",21.054958216877722,1.0,0.3333333333333333
Haroon Gunn-Salie,"Executed on Sunday 17 August 2013, “Zonnebloem renamed” is a site-specific performative video film marking the centenary of the 1913 Natives Land Act in South Africa. The short film forms part of the artist’s ongoing collaboration with District Six residents titled WITNESS. Commencing in 2011, WITNESS negotiates the forced removals and land compensation in District Six and across South Africa. District Six was a closely-knit, vibrant and multi-cultural community until the forced removal by the apartheid decree during the 1970s from Cape Town’s city center, when the area was declared ‘whites only’ under the Group Areas Act in 1968. During this time, District Six was officially renamed by the apartheid government as Zonnebloem. The renaming further erased the history of the area and people from maps, memories and public spaces. Gunn-Salie’s short film presents a series of temporary artworks by changing the ‘Zonnebloem’ road signs in central Cape Town to read ‘District Six’. “Zonnebloem renamed” is an attempt by Gunn-Salie to change apartheid and colonial heritage that dominates people popular memory in Cape Town and South Africa through aesthetic and social intervention.","Haroon Gunn-Salie (b. Cape Town, South Africa, 1989) is currently based between Cape Town and Johannesburg. Having completed his studies in Cape Town’s Michaelis School of Fine Art in 2012, Gunn-Salie is an active participant in Cape Town’s local contemporary art community. Gunn-Salie‘s collaborative art practice is focused on translating the oral histories of his community into artistic interventions and installations. Employing a multidisciplinary practice and working with residents of District Six — an area in central Cape Town where widespread forced removals occurred — Gunn-Salie provokes collaborative dialogues and exchanges surrounding the still unresolved issues of forced removals under apartheid.",Zonnebloem Renamed,Middle East & Africa,"['district.n.01', 'south_africa.n.01', 'south.n.01 africa.n.01', 'town.n.01', 'africa.n.01', 'south.n.01', 'witness.n.01', 'short.a.01', 'land.n.01', 'memory.n.01', 'movie.n.01', 'people.n.01', 'map.n.01', 'read.v.01', 'change.v.01', 'collaboration.n.01', 'aesthetic.a.01', 'sign.n.01', 'intervention.n.01', 'popular.a.01', 'government.n.01', 'community.n.01', 'center.n.01', 'artwork.n.01', 'attempt.n.01']","['apartheid.n.01', 'intervention.n.01', 'memory.n.01', 'history.n.01', 'colonial.n.01', 'imperialism.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/haroongunn-salie_zonnebloemrenamed.png,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/haroongunn-salie_zonnebloemrenamed-300x194.png,https://kadist.org/work/zonnebloem-renamed/,"['Cultural/4.0307692307692315', 'Material_Physical/3.566233766233766', 'Individual_Personal/3.3956043956043955']","['Cultural', 'Material_Physical', 'Individual_Personal']",10.992607392607393,"['Time/2.709090909090909', 'Mind/2.5384615384615383', 'Culture/2.307692307692308']","['Time', 'Mind', 'Culture']",7.555244755244756,"['Material_Physical/37.171703769226994', 'Society/28.30313869137399', 'Cultural/22.490063041533638']","['Material_Physical', 'Society', 'Cultural']",87.96490550213463,"['Land/32.08818728571051', 'Urbanization/16.673590461825757', 'Media/7.698473748473748']","['Land', 'Urbanization', 'Media']",56.46025149601002,0.6666666666666666,0.0
Mikhael Subotzky,"“Pasvang, Pollsmoor Maximum Security Prison” is the result of three months Subotzky spent inside the walls of Pollsmoor Prison, an overcrowded correctional facility largely controlled by gangs. Through talking to the prisoners and the warders, teaching classes in photography to the inmates and documenting his experiences, Subotzky captured a unique perspective of the prisoners and the prison itself. Subotzky was working digitally, and a key feature of the Pollsmoor work was panoramic images in which he would stitch together a number of shots to give a 360-degree view of the jammed prison wards and spaces. While the desperate sense of beaten down men, caged within a harsh institutional environment is prevalent throughout the Vier Hoeke series, there are nonetheless moments that show the survival of the human spirit, even under the direst circumstances. “Pasvang, Pollsmoor Maximum Security Prison” thus represents significantly more than a documentary insight into a prison, rather it is the documentation and culmination of Subotzky’s intervention undertaken in an attempt to understand and undermine power systems in South Africa.","Mikhael Subotzky’s (b. 1981, Cape Town, South Africa) film, video and photographic works examine the construction and internal structures of narratives concerning representation. His photographs and films frame the spontaneity of action and the stillness of portraiture through very precise compositions. Whether natural or artificial, the scenes are bathed in light that falls gracefully onto the grit and grime of interiors and exteriors alike. Subotzky’s work is very often a result of his immersion within communities and individuals traversing the penal system (Die Vier Hoeke – The Four Corners), everyday life in post-apartheid South Africa Umjiegwana (The Outside and Beaufort West) and the contemporary and historical structures of power. In publishing books alongside his exhibitions — Beaufort West (2008), Retinal Shift (2012) and, with Patrick Waterhouse, Ponte City (2014) — Subotzky’s oeuvre provides an invaluable insight into the power systems of South Africa.","Pasvang, Pollsmoor Maximum Security Prison",Middle East & Africa,"['prison.n.01', 'position.n.03', 'south_africa.n.01', 'south.n.01 africa.n.01', 'spirit.n.01', 'documentation.n.01', 'documentary.a.01', 'africa.n.01', 'class.n.01', 'feature.n.01', 'intervention.n.01', 'south.n.01', 'shooting.n.01', 'environment.n.01', 'attempt.n.01', 'photography.n.01', 'cardinal.s.01', 'consequence.n.01', 'moment.n.01', 'power.n.01', 'sense.n.01', 'wall.n.01', 'human.a.01', 'experience.n.01', 'space.n.01']","['imprisonment.n.01', 'resilience.n.01', 'power.n.01', 'prison.n.01', 'south_africa.n.01', 'documentary.a.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/mikhaelsubotzky_pasvang_low.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/mikhaelsubotzky_pasvang_low-300x200.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/pasvang-pollsmoor-prison/,"['Material_Physical/7.296806117858749', 'Politics/4.112962201197496', 'Society/2.42483660130719']","['Material_Physical', 'Politics', 'Society']",13.834604920363434,"['Land/2.6198830409356724', 'Power/2.511655011655012', 'Inequality/1.6013071895424837']","['Land', 'Power', 'Inequality']",6.732845242133168,"['Material_Physical/23.011269432322067', 'Cultural/14.738577212261426', 'Individual_Personal/13.141777830013126']","['Material_Physical', 'Cultural', 'Individual_Personal']",50.89162447459662,"['Land/16.32098194203457', 'Spirituality/4.999567099567099', 'Culture/4.887912087912088']","['Land', 'Spirituality', 'Culture']",26.208461129513758,0.3333333333333333,0.3333333333333333
Mikhael Subotzky,"At the halfway point along South Africa’s Highway N1, running from Cape Town to Johannesburg, sits the small town of Beaufort West. The 1,200-mile highway joins the northern provinces of the country to the south cuts through. Beaufort West becomes the main strip of the township, whereby the thousands of commuters passing through are thus forced to witness the town’s squalid social and economic condition. “Samuel (Standing), Vaalkoppies (Beaufort West Rubbish Dump)” is a reflection of economic reality of Beaufort West, where Subotzky spends a significant amount of time with the lesser fortunate black residents to understand the conflicted reality of existence in this pass-through town. The photograph quickly sweeps the viewer into the lives of the marginalized; the trash pickers at the local dump while simultaneously referencing the white citizens at a livestock show, the households that set up makeshift taverns, prostitution of the truck drivers, and the prison, housed centrally in the township. What seems to be an endless landscape of rubbish, leading into the sky, Subotzky’s central figure wearing a Mexican wrestling mask, is a confronting challenge for recognition and change of the aftermath of the South African apartheid and economic disaster.","Mikhael Subotzky’s (b. 1981, Cape Town, South Africa) film, video and photographic works examine the construction and internal structures of narratives concerning representation.

Santu Mofokeng,"Since the global capital expansion, billboards have been the medium of communication between the rulers and the residents of townships. In South Africa, a billboard is a relic from the times when Africans were subjects of power and when townships were restricted areas, subject to laws, municipality by-laws and ordinances regulated the movement of persons and governed who may or may not enter the township. Mofokeng references this medium for control through tracing the history of townships in South Africa. “A Taste For Life, Baragwanath Terminus, Diepkloof” captures the ruinous landscape surrounding the social, economic and political power of alcohol companies represented in the billboard.  Referencing the history of billboards in South Africa — the economic boom of the sixties introduced American style highway advertising billboards that rendered Apartheid ideology anonymous and opaque, the politically turbulent period of the 1970s and 1980s that saw a resurgence of billboards and the recent liberalization of politics with the billboard used to address the HIV/AIDS pandemic — “A Taste For Life, Baragwanath Terminus, Diepkloof”, is a legible palimpsest for reading consumerism, the selling of an unachievable beauty, and cultural fear in Soweto. Mofokeng explores the way in which freedom of speech and cultural sensibility is assaulted by textual and visual bombardment in billboards.","The photographic artwork of Santu Mofokeng (b. Soweto, South Africa, 1956), also known as Mofokengâ, explores the complicated societal paradigm of South Africa. Exploring rural farm life, townships, religious rituals and the quotidian life of Black South Africans, Mofokeng’s artwork significantly contributes to a greater understanding of development and identity in the South African context. Mofokeng’s acute insight into the cultural meanings in landscape is testified in his mastership of the photographic medium. Using black and white film as a reference to the documentary genre and a gesture of resistance to the color-rich saturation of consumer culture, Mofokeng’s work presents new meanings on the trodden landscapes Soweto, favoring memory and identity over ownership and power. In highlighting the impoverishment of South African landscape in the face of capital expansion, Mofokeng’s photographs implore emancipation from the global oppression of greed.","A taste for life, Baragwanath Terminus, Diepkloof",Middle East & Africa,"['south_africa.n.01', 'south.n.01 africa.n.01', 'africa.n.01', 'south.n.01', 'economic.a.01', 'power.n.01', 'medium.n.01', 'cultural.a.01', 'address.n.03', 'ad.n.01', 'control.n.01', 'company.n.01', 'anonymous.a.01', 'fear.n.01', 'history.n.01', 'capable.s.02', 'times.n.01', 'represent.v.01', 'beauty.n.01', 'life.n.01', 'global.s.01', 'politics.n.01', 'time_period.n.01', 'american.a.01', 'person.n.01']","['capitalism.n.01', 'greed.n.01', 'inequality.n.01', 'billboard.n.01', 'history.n.01', 'corporation.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/A-TASTE-FOR-LIFE-BARAGWANATH-TERMINUS-DIEPKLOOFsite.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/A-TASTE-FOR-LIFE-BARAGWANATH-TERMINUS-DIEPKLOOFsite-300x197.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/a-taste-for-life/,"['Society/4.433333333333334', 'Politics/1.8333333333333335', 'Material_Physical/1.709090909090909']","['Society', 'Politics', 'Material_Physical']",7.9757575757575765,"['Economy/1.8333333333333335', 'Inequality/1.8333333333333335', 'History/1.8']","['Economy', 'Inequality', 'History']",5.466666666666667,"['Material_Physical/27.920049541102173', 'Individual_Personal/26.046087246087254', 'Society/15.918370518370523']","['Material_Physical', 'Individual_Personal', 'Society']",69.88450730555995,"['Land/15.463839084891717', 'Emotion/10.543223443223445', 'Power/7.749017649017649']","['Land', 'Emotion', 'Power']",33.756080177132816,0.6666666666666666,0.0
Santu Mofokeng,"Mofokeng’s experiences during the turbulent time of the 1980s in South Africa led to a turn in his practice, opting to turn to the crowd, focusing on individual faces and bodies within the masses to tell a story of the collective resistance that is present in the daily life and surroundings of South African townships. “Miriam Maine’s funeral” urges the viewer to connect to the sadness that they are witnessing in the scene. Miriam Maine — the sister in law of Kas Maine a tenant farmer Mofokeng documented for historian Charles Van Onselen — was a respected member of the Bloemhof community. “Miriam Maine’s funeral” is a photojournalistic documentation of bittersweet loss and the collective mourning of a community.","The photographic artwork of Santu Mofokeng (b.

Sue Williamson,"In her 2003 series “Better Lives”, Sue Williamson explores stories of immigrants in search of a better life in a historically contentious South Africa. In an attempt to address and confront xenophobia in South African history, Better Lives series subverts racism and prejudice by emphasizing the immigrant as human, and thus gives the subjects a voice. “Better Lives: Richard Belalufu” tells a tale of surviving in a hostile South Africa through the undercurrent reflections on violence, abuse and the difficulty of finding home as an immigrant. Referring to South African studio-photography, the Better Lives series is a demanding confrontation of the subjects whose gaze answers directly to the viewer.  Burundian Francois Bangurambona was a deputy minister in the Hutu government, when Tutsi soldiers came into his office one day asking for the minister who was not there, and as they left, they threw grenades into his office. Luckily for Francois, his driver heard the explosion, came upstairs, and got him in a car and to hospital and on a plane to Kenya. Now Francois runs a car repair business in Nyanga.","Sue Williamson (b. 1941, Lichfield, United Kingdom) currently based in Cape Town, occupies an influential and highly respected position in the South African art world, not only for her artistic practice but also for her long history as a writer and cultural worker. Trained as a printmaker, Williamson now includes installation, photography and video in her oeuvre. As part of the generation of South African artists who practiced in the 1970s and who addressed social change in the then apartheid South Africa, Williamson’s practice has continued to remain interested in political struggle and emancipation.  In her work, she brings the marginalized into the mainstream consciousness of society, making visible the unseen, sheaving away layers of illusion to re-present reality in a fresh light.

Barbara Kasten,"Barbara Kasten’s Studio Construct 51 depicts an abstract still life: a greyscale photograph of clear translucent panes assembled into geometric forms, the hard lines of their edges converging and bisecting at various points. Light streams from unseen sources and projects rectangular shadows against an adjacent wall. Three-dimensional shapes become suddenly flat as the objects in Kasten’s still life are juxtaposed alongside their ghostly traces. Kasten’s assemblages could be seen as sculptural plays on geometric abstraction, but her sets are deliberately temporary and staged only to be photographed and subsequently dismantled. In shifting focus from the object-as-subject to the document, Studio Construct 51 privileges ephemerality over permanence and suggests that all physical forms are transient and ultimately only recognizable by the artifacts that they leave behind.","Barbara Kasten creates constructions for the camera by building temporary sets out of unidentified materials that she photographs and immediately disassembles. Producing continuously since the 1960s, Kasten’s work is often identified with the California Light and Space Movement, and her photographs deliberately play on perceptual phenomena of light and shadow.

The work references a series of scenes from Alfred’s Hitchcock’s The Lady Vanishes (1938) via a single, uncanny image.","Conceptual artist Rodney Graham’s oeuvre is highly versatile and intellectual. By incorporating fictional narratives and alternative interpretations into an existing context, Graham creates visual puns that layer historical reference to examine social and philosophical systems. Not only is Graham the behind-the-scenes sculptor, photographer, filmmaker, inventor, scholar, writer and singer in his projects, he also literally appears in the finished works, impersonating various fictional characters.","Sunday Sun, 1937",Americas,"['newspaper.n.01', 'pair.n.01', 'hands.n.01', 'individual.a.01', 'figure.n.01', 'people.n.01', 'scene.n.01', 'series.n.01', 'image.n.01']","['eldritch.s.01', 'fiction.n.01', 'preternatural.s.01', 'narrative.s.01', 'dichotomy.n.01', 'mystery.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_Rodney-Graham_Sunday-Sun_WEB.png,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_Rodney-Graham_Sunday-Sun_WEB-300x265.png,https://kadist.org/work/sunday-sun-1937/,"['Cultural/7.799358974358975', 'Individual_Personal/0.875']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal']",8.674358974358974,"['Fantasy/5.491666666666667', 'Arts/1.5384615384615385', 'Spirituality/0.875']","['Fantasy', 'Arts', 'Spirituality']",7.9051282051282055,"['Cultural/10.826453388372896', 'Society/7.27081807081807', 'Material_Physical/6.701343101343101']","['Cultural', 'Society', 'Material_Physical']",24.798614560534062,"['Media/5.393974755894261', 'Land/3.1965811965811968', 'Community/2.4349206349206347']","['Media', 'Land', 'Community']",11.025476587396094,0.4,0.0
Sebastian Diaz Morales,"In Suspension a young man is hanging in the air, falling, or perhaps drifting through time and space. There is no special or definite way to understand it. And it is in this construction where Morales envisions the world as an endless void, or timeless gravity, that we fall deeper and deeper into our own humanity.","Morales’ film and videos are often times surreal where social reality is reflected in a form that is visually abstract and fantasy-based. Most of his works study the relationships between a large-scale socio-political power and the actions of individuals; they reflect the interactions between people and their environment and social structures. The methods that Morales uses are twofold – in his works he uses both prepared scripts and the uncertainties of real life. His camera is focused on capturing documentary material, but he also uses footage that is experimental and that comes from the realms of science fiction.",Suspension,Americas,"['construction.n.01', 'space.n.01', 'time.n.01']","['nothingness.n.01', 'gravity.n.01', 'suspension.n.01', 'humanness.n.01', 'fall.v.01', 'dateless.s.04', 'amniotic.a.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_SDM_2015_Suspension_Still_1-WEB.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_SDM_2015_Suspension_Still_1-WEB-300x168.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/suspension/,"['Material_Physical/4.488888888888889', 'Individual_Personal/1.6']","['Material_Physical', 'Individual_Personal']",6.088888888888889,"['Physics/1.8888888888888888', 'Time/1.0', 'Identity/0.8']","['Physics', 'Time', 'Identity']",3.688888888888889,"['Cultural/4.712418300653595', 'Material_Physical/2.427350427350427']","['Cultural', 'Material_Physical']",7.139768728004022,"['Arts/3.934640522875817', 'Space/0.8888888888888888', 'Design/0.7777777777777778']","['Arts', 'Space', 'Design']",5.601307189542483,0.5,0.0

Ha Tae-Bum,"Ha Tae-Bum’s “White” series, started in 2008, begins with photographic images from the mainstream media depicting sites of conflict or crisis. The artist eliminates human presence, miscellaneous details, and all color from the images, then “rebuilds” them into quiet, achromatic models with thin white paper. Once complete, the models are photographed in a nearly identical composition as the original image. Terrorist attack International University Islamabad, Pakistan (2010) depicts the aftermath of the 2009 International Islamic University suicide bombing in Islamabad. Here the color white symbolizes lost memory of the sympathy and the covering of the fear. Artificially transformed, the casted buildings and scene appear dreamy, fixed in time, and aesthetically attractive. The Palestine Wall depicts the structure separating Israel from the West Bank, a barrier that restricts the movement of people and goods to the other side. The visual and semantic distinctions surrounding its meaning and dimensionality are stark, pointing to the power that pictures and their linguistic counterparts have to both inform and elude.","Ha Tae-Bum (b. 1974, lives in South Korea) was trained as a sculptor in South Korea and Germany.

Zach Reini,"Particularly shaped by his own youth in the 1990s, his recent works have incorporated things like a marijuana leaf, a dragon-emblazoned chain wallet, metal grommets, and the ubiquitous (in the 90s) Stussy symbol. Reflecting and recouping elements from American youth culture, Reini’s works question how we package, mark, and express ourselves through manufactured symbols of identity.  Reini has also used images of Mickey Mouse—Disney’s anthropomorphic icon—in numerous works, including in this pair of works, The More You Want…, …The Less You Get. Both works are made using latex and canvas in cut-out patterns that form the shape of the famous mouse, and his female counterpart, Minnie.  Reini’s use of these iconic characters is pointed and swift: even the simple suggestion of a form, implied through the cuts in the canvas, is enough to flood viewers with associations and memories. These shared pop images, which Reini evokes through negation, through absence, become the shorthand for a modern culture bereft of real connections.","In the work of American artist Zach Reini, elements of recent pop culture mix with art historical references to create works tinged with playfulness and darkness. Indebted to pop art as well as modernist painting, much of Reini’s work revolves around markers that adorn the human body, defining and branding their wearer.","The More You Want…, …The Less You Get",Americas,"['symbol.n.01', 'culture.n.01', 'mark.n.01', 'female.a.01', 'pair.n.01', 'association.n.01', 'connection.n.01', 'form.n.03', 'iconic.a.01', 'celebrated.s.01', 'viewing_audience.n.01', 'modern.a.01', 'simple.a.01', 'american.a.01', 'real.a.01', 'shape.n.01', 'elements.n.01', 'image.n.01', 'identity.n.01', 'fictional_character.n.01', 'memory.n.01', 'question.n.01', 'form.n.01']","['popular.s.04', 'young_person.n.01', 'symbolism.n.01', 'icon.n.01', 'united_states.n.01', 'identity.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_ZREI0015-WEB.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_ZREI0015-WEB-200x300.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/the-more-you-want-the-less-you-get/,"['Individual_Personal/4.797979797979798', 'Material_Physical/2.6198830409356724', 'Society/0.7777777777777778']","['Individual_Personal', 'Material_Physical', 'Society']",8.195640616693249,"['Identity/4.797979797979798', 'Land/2.6198830409356724', 'Urbanization/0.7777777777777778']","['Identity', 'Land', 'Urbanization']",8.195640616693249,"['Individual_Personal/18.525868902339496', 'Cultural/13.337845651080947', 'Material_Physical/4.413533834586467']","['Individual_Personal', 'Cultural', 'Material_Physical']",36.27724838800691,"['Mind/7.381124757595345', 'Identity/5.567210567210567', 'Culture/5.415384615384616']","['Mind', 'Identity', 'Culture']",18.363719940190528,0.6666666666666666,0.3333333333333333

Mary Reid Kelley,"In the video The Syphilis of Sisyphus (2011), Reid Kelley transported her heroine to the French demimonde. The film centers on a pregnant Parisian prostitute who exemplifies Baudelaire’s paean to the superiority of cosmetic over natural beauty. With sets that shift between Sisyphus’s boudoir and the streets of Paris, the work is an antic romp through Revolutionary and post Revolutionary France, with brief vignettes involving everyone from Diderot, Marie Antoinette, and Marat to Robespierre, Napoleon, and Haussmann. In a commentary on the fate of overly aggressive women, it ends with our rebellious heroine carted off to Charcot’s sanatorium.","As a challenging artist who marches to her own drum, Mary Reid Kelley is in the vanguard of a generation that blends the digital and the analog to dialogue with history. From 2009 to the present, she has made videos that fuse live performance, animation, drawing, sculpture, and digital design. Her characters—a nurse, a prostitute, a bohemian, Ariadne, and the Minotaur—confront the limits of their situations in droll verse. Blending Homer and Cindy Sherman by way of Virginia Woolf, Reid Kelley tells finely wrought narrative epics, rife with wordplay and art historical references. She situates her work in World War I, nineteenth-century Paris, or classical antiquity. Working with archival sources and a range of collaborators, often Patrick Kelley, her husband and an accomplished artist, Reid Kelley invents a poetic hybrid of mediums.

Shimpei Takeda,"While still living in New York, shortly after the nuclear power plant disaster, Shimpei Takeda heard an NPR interview with a survivor living in temporary housing in Fukushima. He noticed that the dialect was similar to that of his grandparents. Straightaway he went back to Japan and turned to camera-less photographic techniques to capture otherwise unseen interactions of materials and light. Takeda recognized photographic materials as a receptor for radiation rather than visible light. By taking photographic paper on which he placed radioactive soil, an element as primal as a particle of earth, he devised a direct means of picture making in the Fukushima aftermath. His results are physical records of the catastrophe, and enigmatic in their mysterious beauty.","Born in 1982 in Fukushima, Shimpei Takeda grew up in Chiba just outside Tokyo. The family made annual visits to grandparents in Sukagawa. The area happens to be forty miles east of the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Plant. Takeda moved to New York in 2002.

Masaya Chiba,"Fairy #2 (2011) depicts a surreal scene of roughly assembled household ephemera, potted plants, and a faintly visible figure rendered in thin red line. The picture shows a grouping of tables and stools arranged in a dense cluster. A collection of objects, all brown or burlap-hued, cover their surfaces: ceramic pots, wooden planks, roughly geometric wooden sculptures, and even a small figure that perches precariously atop of miniature cube alongside a forked wood finish form. Chiba’s use of a nearly monochromatic palette makes it difficult to discern many of these objects, and they only become recognizable from their faint resemblances to things in real life. The picture’s monochromatic field, however, is interrupted by color three times: by the French blue finish of a stool positioned in the background, by the leafy green foliage of two potted plants, and by the nearly imperceptible red line drawing of a figure superimposed over the dense assemblage in the foreground. Presumably the “fairy” of the work’s title, the red figure looks towards the viewer with soft eyes and a delicate smile and at first glance appears benevolent. Chiba, however, renders the fairy into a violently contorted posture, its arms and legs twisted to conform along the shape of the objects piled behind it. Alternately playful and curiously violent, Fairy #2 offers a dreamlike image that is at once reminiscent of bedtime stories and apocalyptic fears. In this context, the “fairy” could be seen as an imaginatively playful creature, but it could also be read as an allusion to the faint bodily outlines left behind during the nuclear bombing attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki during World War II.","Masaya Chiba utilizes painting, sculpture, and installation to create dreamlike works that respond to Surrealism traditions while also exploring the limits of representation and translation. Many of his paintings begin as assemblages in his studio, and in preparing these installations, Chiba collects seemingly random assortments of objects – photographs, wooden planks, potted plants, excess paint – to stage unusual material landscapes. Other objects used in his paintings are also drawn from memory, suggesting an illusory attempt to recapture objects and experiences that no longer exist in the present. Once configured into a desired form, Chiba utilizes these installations and objects as studies for his richly rendered oil paintings. Seemingly whimsical at first glance, his pictures also suggest an undercurrent of anxiety and instability, as if the perceptible world was melting away below us.",Fairy #2,Asia,"['red.s.01', 'playful.a.01', 'figure.n.01', 'plant.n.01', 'picture.n.01', 'object.n.01', 'french.a.01', 'wooden.s.01', 'geometric.s.01', 'wood.n.01', 'gathering.n.01', 'glance.n.01', 'field.n.01', 'read.v.01', 'fear.n.01', 'times.n.01', 'leave.v.01', 'animal.n.01', 'eyes.n.01', 'visible.a.01', 'background.n.01', 'color.n.01', 'real.a.01', 'shape.n.01', 'family.n.01']","['phantasmagoric.s.01', 'fantasy.n.01', 'everyday.s.01', 'imagination.n.01', 'domestic.n.01', 'magic.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/chiba_1-9397_fairy_2_cc_web.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/chiba_1-9397_fairy_2_cc_web-300x200.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/fairy-2/,"['Individual_Personal/11.01372549019608', 'Cultural/7.565196078431373', 'Material_Physical/2.6013071895424837']","['Individual_Personal', 'Cultural', 'Material_Physical']",21.18022875816994,"['Fantasy/7.565196078431373', 'Mind/5.216666666666667', 'Spirituality/4.997058823529412']","['Fantasy', 'Mind', 'Spirituality']",17.77892156862745,"['Individual_Personal/24.56874236874238', 'Society/14.286344374579672', 'Material_Physical/11.009920634920636']","['Individual_Personal', 'Society', 'Material_Physical']",49.865007378242694,"['Emotion/10.543223443223445', 'Community/4.247552447552447', 'History/4.1457516339869285']","['Emotion', 'Community', 'History']",18.93652752476282,0.6666666666666666,0.0
Teppei Kaneuji,"In his White Discharge series (2002 to today), arguably his best known works, Kaneuji assembles old toys and plastic scarps into dramatic mounded heaps and covers the surface with white plastic resin, drawing on allusions to landfills, commodity fetishism, and creative repurposing. White Discharge (Built-Up Objects #38) (2014) appears playful, like a lost landscape from a whimsical Dr. Seuss story awaiting a charmingly wacky inhabitant. But in drawing its source materials from prefabricated and mass-produced objects, Kaneuji’s work also suggests more trenchant anxieties consumer culture and the rapid and wasteful accumulation that becomes “built-up” in all of our lives. In this context, the resin’s “white discharge” could also be read as alluding to an almost masturbatory commodity fetishism in which material objects become the very focus of our erotic fixations. This work offers a striking meditation on the presumed value of everyday objects and our relationship to material goods once they become obsolete, damaged, or deemed unusable. By repurposing these materials for his art, Kaneuji reimagines an almost utopian relationship between consumers and objects in which refuse becomes they very “stuff” and substance of sculpture and installation.","Teppei Kaneuji produces sculptures and installation-based work that interrogates Japan’s continuously burgeoning postwar culture of commodification.

Aki Kondo,"Mogeji’s Journey (2014) depicts three hand painted stills from an animated sequence in Aki Kondo’s film Hikari (Light) (2015). Kondo’s film tells the story of a young woman named Juneko who discovers that she is terminally ill and the ways that this impacts her lover, a painter, who tries to reconnect with her by painting her portrait from memory. As Juneko becomes sicker, her hair begins to fall out, a symptom of her unnamed illness. As her condition deteriorates, the film toggles back and forth with the animated story of Mogeji, a white strand of hair inhabiting Juneko’s body who becomes anthropomorphized through Kondo’s animation and recounts his own story of mortality and loss. The three canvases that comprise Mogeji’s Journey depict their own miniaturized narrative: Mogeji’s recounting of his personal story to a younger strand of hair, his sadness at recognizing his inevitable decline, and his descent into the unknown as he falls off Juneko’s body. Rendered with broadly expressive brushstrokes in a whimsically cartoonish style, Kondo draws on trenchant metaphors around vulnerability by focusing on how hair effectively “dies” as soon it is born. Reframed in the context of Kondo’s larger film project, Mogeji’s Journey becomes a far more serious and poetic meditation on the limits of inhabiting a human body and the inexorable “journey” towards the light that we all must take.","Aki Kondo utilizes animation, video, and mixed media to explore such varied topics as intimacy, loss, and the human body. Her work crosses multiple practices and frequently investigates the creative process as an object of study in and of itself, exploring how artistic mediums can communicate emotionally complicated narrative through expressive and resonant images.

Karthik Pandian,"Filmed in Morocco, the film Atlas by Karthik Pandian continues his investigation into history, site and monument. The film explores fundamental notions of movement, freedom and the cinematic imaginary through the figure of the camel. Rather than focusing on the Moroccan patrimonial landscape, which is itself full of simulations and fantasies conjured for the touristic imagination, Pandian shot the video in Ouarzazate, Hollywood’s go-to location to stage the desert — from Lawrence of Arabia to The Mummy. Littered with deteriorating sets constructed for films set in Jerusalem, ancient Egypt, Rome, Mecca… etc, the site portrayed in the video is itself disoriented, as Pandian collapses the distinction between set and location. Is it the Middle East? Is it the Western imagination of the Middle East? Is it a Moroccan fiction of the Middle East constructed for a Western gaze? In the video, camel ‘actors’ in custom-tailored costumes embroidered with American pennies and nickels, restlessly traverse the frame. Pandian’s stroboscopic editing of these sequences recall the flicker of Eadweard Muybridge’s 19th century animal locomotion studies, which focused photographic attention on the camel when it was first being introduced to the American West. The video also features an original score written for Pandian by renowned experimental composer Christian Wolff. The score, performed with coins, along with the embroidery on the costumes, summon the uneven exchanges – cultural, political, economic – that haunt the pursuit of liberty.","Los Angeles-born artist Karthik Pandian’s work explores our relationship to historical consciousness and the various ways in which we perceive and perform the past. Working across moving image, sculpture, performance, and film — having adopted the 16mm format inspired by ethnographic film — Pandian describes his work as being ‘concerned in particular with the way in which history lurks in matter.’ As such, he takes cues from the architecture and archaeology of sights, allowing the material history of objects and places to speak. Several of his videos and films in multimedia installations are accompanied by architectural structures or sculptural elements, that he often projects onto. In a notable work, Unearth (2011),  for example, Pandian’s research of the Native American Cahokia culture and its ceremonial monuments resulted in films projected onto pillars made from ground soil taken from the research sites. Even though his work is research driven and has cultural references scattered throughout — in the forms of labyrinths, temples, and ancient structures among many others — Pandian’s interest is in the fictive possibilities that these representations from and of the past can carry. Through the play of time and materiality, and through a thought process that embraces ambivalence and opacity, the monuments and relics that Pandian captures become entangled in stroboscopic reverberations between past and present.",Atlas,Americas,"['east.n.01', 'mark.n.01', 'center.n.01', 'imagination.n.01', 'western.a.01', 'put.v.01', 'location.n.01', 'american.a.01', 'video.n.01', 'movie.n.01', 'west.n.01', 'probe.n.01', 'film.v.01', 'perform.v.01', 'gaze.n.01', 'memorial.n.03', 'exchange.n.01', 'actor.n.01', 'fantasy.n.01', 'survey.n.01', 'sequence.n.01', 'celebrated.s.01', 'write.v.01', 'fiction.n.01', 'attention.n.01']","['temporalty.n.01', 'history.n.01', 'fiction.n.01', 'present.n.01', 'camel.n.01', 'alien.s.02']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/karthik_pandian_atlas_web.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/karthik_pandian_atlas_web-300x169.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/atlas/,"['Cultural/7.799358974358975', 'Material_Physical/6.567210567210567', 'Society/1.0']","['Cultural', 'Material_Physical', 'Society']",15.366569541569541,"['Fantasy/5.491666666666667', 'Time/4.997979797979798', 'Arts/1.5384615384615385']","['Fantasy', 'Time', 'Arts']",12.028108003108004,"['Cultural/23.318706456941754', 'Material_Physical/19.54421983245513', 'Individual_Personal/11.369397759103643']","['Cultural', 'Material_Physical', 'Individual_Personal']",54.23232404850052,"['Fantasy/11.056862745098039', 'Land/9.546153846153848', 'Arts/6.564835164835164']","['Fantasy', 'Land', 'Arts']",27.16785175608705,0.6666666666666666,0.6666666666666666
Kate Mitchell,"In Time is a 24-hour video in which the artist rests, hangs and clings onto the minute hand of a large clock, 4 x 4 meters in diameter, arduously counting out a full 24-hour cycle so that the video becomes a functional time-keeping device. In standing in for and becoming time, Mitchell ultimately examines its essence as it passes before her. Dressed in blue work overalls, Mitchell appears like a maintenance or quality control worker, making sure every moment is up to muster. The paradox: even if it is deemed to not be up to scratch, a re-wind to re-live is impossible, the moment has already passed. Time continues, regardless of whether it is approved of or not. Through Mitchell’s absurd examination of time, we are reminded to be attentive to its ever constant passing; how we spend our days is how we spend our lives.","Kate Mitchell’s work addresses everyday worries; time, money, work and the future. For the artist the idea of art as work and the artist as both manager and worker is important. Her videos document the artist working tirelessly to achieve seemingly reckless and unattainable tasks.

Khadim Ali & Sher Ali,"Transaction/Evacuation is a collaborative painting by Khadim Ali and Sher Ali, and is part of a larger collaborative body of works by the artists, which share the same title. Like Khadim Ali, Sher Ali is also part of the Hazara people, and experienced massive personal and social trauma early in life, losing his parents at the age of ten and witnessing the devastation of the Afghan Civil War in his native Kabul.  The horned figure in the foreground represents Rustam, a legendary hero in Iranian mythology and central character in the Shahnameh, who depicted here by the artists as a potbellied demon, stripped away of its heroism. Demons are a recurring motif used by Khadim Ali to portray his own people and history. As he explains, the demons are “a collective portrait of Hazaras through the eyes of others,” and as such they speak of the dehumanization and demonization that Hazaras have and continue to endure.  Another key figure in the work, and also a recurring motif in Khadim Ali’s oeuvre, is the image of Buddha. The motif represents the homeland of the Hazaras—the land of the Bamiyan Buddhas—and is also a reference to the great sense of loss after in 2001 the Taliban destroyed the monumental statues of Buddha dating from the fourth and fifth century.  In Transaction/Evacuation, the artists draw inspiration from miniature Iranian painting, incorporating traditional techniques and materials—such as gold leaf and gouache on wasli paper – as a vehicle for telling their shared experience of persecution, displacement and discrimination.","Khadim Ali was born in Quetta, Pakistan, after his family fled their home in Afghanistan to escape persecution from the Taliban. Part of a highly persecuted minority group called the Hazaras, he grew up as a refugee, and from an early age he was confronted with the discrimination, displacement and genocide of his people, which is a key focus of his work as an artist.     Ali was trained in classical miniature painting in Lahore, Pakistan and in mural painting and calligraphy in Tehran, Iran, and as a result he incorporates delicate handwork and materials from these traditions into his intricately rendered paintings, and large textiles.     Another key influence is the Shahnameh or Book of Kings, a tenth-century epic poem and an icon of Persian literature, which Khadim Ali grew up listening to as a child when his Grandfather sang poetry from it, and crowds would gather to hear his voice. The illustrated version of the book contained paintings from 15th century Iran and Afghanistan, which marked his first encounter with miniature painting and would become his a gateway into the world of art.     Borrowing motifs from The Shahnameh, his works are imbued with the deeply personal, drawing a trajectory between his own past, the somber history of the Hazaras, and the abiding sense of displacement, loss and melancholia.",Transaction/Evacuation,Middle East & Africa,"['motif.n.01', 'artist.n.01', 'cardinal.s.01', 'figure.n.01', 'people.n.01', 'loss.n.01', 'injury.n.01', 'age.n.01', 'native.a.01', 'eyes.n.01', 'land.n.01', 'technique.n.01', 'corporate.s.03', 'traditional.a.01', 'century.n.01', 'personal.a.01', 'paper.n.01', 'war.n.01', 'mention.n.01', 'portrayal.n.01', 'sense.n.01', 'fictional_character.n.01', 'experience.n.01', 'title.n.01', 'social.a.01']","['religion.n.02', 'spirituality.n.02', 'mythology.n.01', 'persecution.n.01', 'supplanting.n.01', 'discrimination.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/image_khadim_ali_and_sher_ali_transaction_evacuation.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/image_khadim_ali_and_sher_ali_transaction_evacuation-191x300.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/transaction-evacuation/,"['Society/7.705304928989141', 'Politics/5.535662686127083', 'Individual_Personal/4.5777777777777775']","['Society', 'Politics', 'Individual_Personal']",17.818745392894,"['Inequality/3.7356626861270827', 'Spirituality/3.0', 'Violence/1.8473684210526315']","['Inequality', 'Spirituality', 'Violence']",8.583031107179714,"['Individual_Personal/15.316967002725523', 'Cultural/12.203707893413778', 'Society/11.339982403217697']","['Individual_Personal', 'Cultural', 'Society']",38.860657299357,"['Mind/4.78552036199095', 'Land/4.372405372405372', 'Spirituality/3.924786324786325']","['Mind', 'Land', 'Spirituality']",13.082712059182647,0.6666666666666666,0.3333333333333333
Kota Ezawa,"Paint and Unpaint is an animation by Kota Ezawa based on a scene from a popular 1951 film by Hans Namuth featuring Jackson Pollock. At first glance, due to the oversimplified silhouettes Ezawa employs, the connection between his animation and Namuth’s film may not be obvious. However, when seen side by side, Ezawa’s piece is a faithful reproduction of the scene—up until a point in which his sequence begins playing in reverse, effectively unpainting every brushstroke. The scene in Namuth’s film is remembered by many for its experimental nature: with the camera pointed towards the sky, Pollock paints onto a sheet of glass as Namuth films the process from the opposite side. Through this unique viewpoint, what results is a filmic device that effectively conveyed Pollock’s process of “action painting” to wide audiences. As Ezawa gives this iconic scene a new life as a digital animation, he adds an additional layer of separation from the original source of focus, which is Pollock’s paint. Ezawa’s choice to reference Namuth relates to his ongoing investigation of the symbolic power of images in the mainstream. Allegedly, Namuth was more interested in the image of Pollock than his actual work, and as the author of several photographs and the 1951 film, his own role as image-maker was essential in conveying Pollock’s process to audiences and contributing to his fame. As much as the original film is about Pollock, Ezawa’s retake is constructed around Namuth’s representation of the iconic artist, and the degree to which it was responsible for constructing his identity in our social imaginary.","Working across slide projections, paper cut-outs, watercolor, light boxes, and animations, Kota Ezawa is known for his flattened, stylized artworks, evocative of pop art and mainstream animation. Ezawa appropriates and modifies iconic imagery sourced from current events, pop culture and art history, reducing them into simplified illustrations that retain the essence of the original image. Rather than a critique of the specific artworks, people, or events that he depicts, his interest lies in the symbolic power of the images that have immortalized them in the mainstream. Whether depicting celebrities like Jimi Hendrix, iconic artworks like Josef Albers’ Homage to the Square, or events such as the verdict in the OJ Simpson trial, his subject matter are the archetypal images that have made lasting impressions in our collective consciousness. Through his work he meditates on the weight that such popular media has in shaping our psyche, shared experience, and even memory.","Paint, Unpaint",Americas,"['animation.n.01', 'paint.n.01', 'iconic.a.01', 'audience.n.01', 'movie.n.01', 'procedure.n.01', 'original.s.01', 'scene.n.01', 'remember.v.01', 'probe.n.01', 'sky.n.01', 'glance.n.01', 'sheet.n.01', 'glass.n.01', 'writer.n.01', 'connection.n.01', 'sequence.n.01', 'digital.a.01', 'degree.n.01', 'layer.n.01', 'symbolic.a.01', 'popular.a.01', 'beginning.n.04', 'function.n.03', 'construct.v.01']","['animation.n.05', 'popular.s.04', 'illustration.n.01', 'appropriation.n.03', 'expressionism.n.01', 'mainstream.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/img_kota_ezawa_paint_unpaint.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/img_kota_ezawa_paint_unpaint-300x199.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/paint-unpaint/,"['Cultural/5.224175824175824', 'Individual_Personal/4.133333333333333', 'Society/0.8']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Society']",10.157509157509157,"['Arts/2.685714285714286', 'Mind/1.7333333333333334', 'Spirituality/1.6']","['Arts', 'Mind', 'Spirituality']",6.019047619047619,"['Cultural/18.65561660561661', 'Society/17.704359692594995', 'Material_Physical/13.084249084249088']","['Cultural', 'Society', 'Material_Physical']",49.444225382460694,"['Arts/6.6289377289377285', 'Media/6.523382173382172', 'Economy/4.852467140702435']","['Arts', 'Media', 'Economy']",18.004787043022336,0.6666666666666666,0.3333333333333333
Jill Magid,"In 1995, the personal and professional archives of the Mexican architect Luis Barragán were acquired (including the rights to the name and the work of the architect) by the Swiss furniture enterprise Vitra. Frederica Zanco, wife of the owner of Vitra, had received these archives as an engagement present, rather than a solitaire diamond. In this video, The Exhumation, the artist poses the question: how to navigate the laws that render Barragán in public space? The artist managed to convince the Mexican congress and the family to use the ashes of the architect to turn them into a diamond. Mounted in a ring, the diamond was intended to serve as a bargaining chip to convince the Swiss heiress to retrocede the archives to the Mexican state. By developing long-term relationships with various personal, government and corporate entities, Magid explores the intersection of psychological identity with national identity and repatriation, international property rights and copyright, the author and the property.","Jill Magid is a conceptual artist specialising in the infiltration of control organs and power systems. Her performance-based practice centres on the frontier between art and life, and underscores the absurdity of our relationship to institutions. Her works put into light the relationships between intimacy and power; the existential condition of the individual in the public sphere; and the emotional, philosophic, and juridical tensions that link us to institutional power. Magid stages relations based on the dynamics of seduction with various organizations, such as the army, the police, or the secret services.

Ali Cherri,"As a discipline born at the same time as colonialism, archeology is struggling to rid itself of this sad context. It is simultaneously the science of the creation and the restoration of ruins. Ali Cherri is interested in auctions of archaeological objects and the desire they inspire in this context. Some, outside the museum, dated vaguely or from obscure sources, are as if they are declassed archeological objects. With his installation Fragments (2016), which combines artifacts and stuffed animals, the artist “rehabilitates” these objects by making them enter the museum without seeking to (re)historicize them, but rather by addressing another form of taxonomy, all commenting on the notion of a “universal museum” that the Louvre can claim. Continuing this work around the value of “found” objects; Ali Cherri began to intervene directly on artifacts, going against their integrity. He produced Endless Falls from a broken pre-Columbian pot, which he repaired with “foreign” elements, from a different provenance and history, creating a sort of mutant out of time. The brass staples emphasize this scarification, and recall that for some cultures the repair is an art, and that the value can be in the imperfection, following Japanese kintsugi. The artist recalls that restoration is an investment in the museum’s liberal system; he strategically chooses what object will be repaired, it will be the one that will attract the public, the one that will contribute to the valuation of the institution itself.","The work of Ali Cherri, currently based in Beirut and in Paris, travers the traces of war in Lebanon in the landscape and in the collective memory. Like other artists of his generation, and unlike Walid Raad’s established generation, Ali Cherri makes more metaphorical correspondences with this story, including linking political and geological catastrophes. He places the place of the landscape and the object in the writing of history, through films and installations. Ali Cherri has developed several works about archeology, exploring and showing how this field is at the heart of the construction of nation-states, notably when nationalist projects write their narrative relying on archaeological heritage. The artist through his practice emphasizes the instrumentalization of objects in different political, cultural and scientific discourses.",Endless Falls,Middle East & Africa,"['museum.n.01', 'artifact.n.01', 'object.n.01', 'context.n.01', 'populace.n.01', 'remember.v.01', 'kind.n.01', 'institution.n.01', 'bear.v.01', 'fragment.n.01', 'creation.n.01', 'animal.n.01', 'japanese.a.01', 'time.n.01', 'desire.n.01', 'beginning.n.04', 'impression.n.01', 'elements.n.01', 'culture.n.01', 'history.n.01', 'form.n.01']","['colonialism.n.01', 'archeology.n.01', 'museum.n.01', 'artifact.n.01', 'restoration.n.02', 'value.v.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Ali-Cherri_Endless-falls.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Ali-Cherri_Endless-falls-300x222.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/endless-falls/,"['Cultural/22.645823766876404', 'Society/15.364647093308424', 'Material_Physical/4.741813741813742']","['Cultural', 'Society', 'Material_Physical']",42.75228460199857,"['Arts/7.96037296037296', 'History/5.255341880341881', 'Culture/3.4993894993894994']","['Arts', 'History', 'Culture']",16.71510434010434,"['Cultural/35.154169952854154', 'Individual_Personal/29.915037903273213', 'Society/22.277430902430908']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Society']",87.34663875855827,"['Arts/13.193706293706294', 'Emotion/12.381618381618384', 'Design/6.748742047426258']","['Arts', 'Emotion', 'Design']",32.324066722750935,0.6666666666666666,0.3333333333333333
Oscar Tuazon,"Oscar Tuazon‘s sculptural oeuvre is situated at the border of art, architecture and technology. Engaging different methods of construction, he frequently uses wood, concrete, glass, steel, and piping as materials to create his structures and installations. Tuazon’s works have roots in minimalism, conceptualism, and architecture, and have a direct relationship with both the site in which they are presented, as well as with their viewer, often through physical engagement. They maintain an improvised, precarious quality that draws upon his long-standing interest in how the built environment is redefined and redesigned by the act of inhabitation.

Ibro Hasanovic,"Note on Multitude is a chilling black-and-white short movie recorded with a single camera in Prishtina, Kosovo, in 2015. The film, beginning in an unidentifiable location, shows a large, bustling and anxious crowd. Soon, the viewer is privy to the setting: a bus station. The film delicately depicts the intimate and emotional movements when families say goodbye, when individuals leave their homes, and when the future, one of a migrant, is unknown. The footage is haunting. The soundtrack to the film, what seems to be ever-increasing voices, conjures great anxiety about the subjects who are about to become migrants, heading towards Hungary, through Serbia, with the hopes to settle in Western Europe. As bodies fall upon each other, all anxious to take a spot in the next departing bus, the faces oscillate between absent waiting mostly seen on the faces of children who are passed into the bus from below, and the nervous faces of men trying to create order in chaos. Hasanovic deliberately deprives the viewer of information about the characters through a lack of dialogue to provide a global perspective of migration. The film implores the viewer to acknowledge and question how and why people seek refuge without providing an answer.","Ibro Hasanovic is a film, video, photographic and installation artist currently based in Brussels, Belgium, concerned largely with the powers of individual and collective memory. As a witness of recent global catastrophic history in Yugoslavia, Hasanovic’s practice is concerned largely with geopolitical and social concerns. His work focuses on micro-events, making History with a capital H graspable on the level of the personal, even anecdotal — a masterly technique described namely by Theodor Adorno and largely employed by seminal artists and writers throughout the 20th century — in an attempt to tackle with excruciating and torturous events such as war, loss, persecution, displacement and torture. Rather than addressing the full-blown horror of recent armed conflicts and ethnical belligerency in a moral or activist mode, the artist casts a closer look at what this entails for the individual or certain groups who are exposed to violence, or the sheer memory of it. Violence, when omnipresent, is not detected as being outrageous and blameful. Rather, ordinary people perceive it as a routinely performed act. Hasanovi? undermines the contemporary epoch that purports violence as a byproduct of politics; as a contemporary status quo.",Note on Multitude,Europe,"['movie.n.01', 'spectator.n.01', 'note.n.01', 'dialogue.n.01', 'unknown.a.01', 'europe.n.01', 'setting.n.01', 'western.a.01', 'short.a.01', 'global.s.01', 'footage.n.01', 'location.n.01', 'voice.n.01', 'future.n.01', 'child.n.01', 'individual.a.01', 'person.n.01', 'family.n.01', 'position.n.03', 'fictional_character.n.01', 'motion.n.03', 'camera.n.01', 'people.n.01', 'make.v.03', 'body.n.01']","['anxiety.n.01', 'supplanting.n.01', 'war.n.01', 'violence.n.01', 'refugee.n.01', 'persecution.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/ibro-hasanovic-01.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/ibro-hasanovic-01-300x169.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/note-on-multitude/,"['Society/13.171384437715707', 'Politics/8.64335499381939', 'Individual_Personal/4.204151404151404']","['Society', 'Politics', 'Individual_Personal']",26.0188908356865,"['Violence/6.344217160548429', 'War/3.7023809523809526', 'Power/3.107692307692308']","['Violence', 'War', 'Power']",13.154290420621688,"['Material_Physical/28.006202440490373', 'Politics/13.98039215686275', 'Cultural/10.928988005458594']","['Material_Physical', 'Politics', 'Cultural']",52.91558260281172,"['Space/11.389566298854227', 'Land/7.288888888888889', 'Time/5.2972222222222225']","['Space', 'Land', 'Time']",23.975677409965336,0.3333333333333333,0.0
Alexandra Pirici,"Furthering Alexandra Pirici’s enquiry into the economy and circulation of artworks, Parthenon Marbles is an immaterial version of the sculptural ensemble embodied by five performers. This ongoing performative action presents and addresses the challenges in the financial and legal implications and value of the original sculptures as cultural capital. The original Parthenon Marbles are a collection of Classical Greek marble sculpture inscriptions and architectural pieces that were originally part of the temple of the Parthenon and other buildings in the Acropolis of Athens, Greece. A major part of the ensemble is held by the British Museum and is known as “the Elgin Marbles”; other Parthenon Marbles can be found in different European museums including the Musée du Louvre in Paris. The Greek government has claimed restitution of Parthenon marbles since its independence from the Ottoman Empire (1832), resulting in an ongoing dispute regarding the diplomatic relationship between Greece and the United Kingdom. Pirici proposes an ongoing action commenting on this request of repatriation as a metaphor and an entry point into a larger discussion about capital, accumulation, circulation, redistribution and the role of the arts within the economy of today.  The piece proposes a performative repatriation, an immaterial version of the sculptural ensemble, to be embodied by performers in the Acropolis Museum at the site prepared for the originals. This action is complemented by research into the financial and legal implications of the sculptures’ situation: a speculative journey into a “what if” scenario of return, starting with statistics exemplifying the Parthenon Marbles importance for the future revenue of the institution, the touristic appeal of the city of Athens and their value as cultural capital. The textual layer performed is a result of the collaboration with curator and writer Victoria Ivanova, which looks at the work in relation to the financial concept of the derivative as a tool for identifying concrete but obscured socio-economic advantages of holding prized artifacts as well as a means for redistributing value through dematerialization/re-materialization and re-circulation.","The performative work of Alexandra Pirici (b. 1982, Bucharest, Romania, currently based between Bucharest and Berlin) addresses the political potential of aesthetics by connecting movement — specifically, the body and its energy — to a re-reading of historical and art historical narratives. She produces enactments, or living sculptures, with performers referencing existing sculptures or monuments in specific contexts. Her first actions in Bucharest occurred in the context of the economic crisis and continuous budget cuts for the arts; notably “If You Don’t Want Us, We Want You” (2011), which confronted the placing of human bodies in relation to heroic, sometimes controversial sculptures, or monuments in public spaces in Bucharest. Intended as a protest action against the state’s cultural policy, these interventions produced friction with playfulness and humor, de-monumentalizing official populist art with the live presence of the human scale. Central to her practice is the questioning of a performance’s function within today’s event economy. Through continuing to interrogate and enquire about the possibility of collective bodies in space and time, Pirici’s work attentively provides an important insight into the living and digital age.",Parthenon Marbles,Europe,"['ongoing.s.01', 'museum.n.01', 'version.n.01', 'action.n.01', 'economy.n.01', 'sculptural.a.01', 'original.s.01', 'sculpture.n.01', 'cultural.a.01', 'piece.n.01', 'artifact.n.01', 'keep.v.01', 'british.a.01', 'perform.v.01', 'institution.n.01', 'architectural.a.01', 'collaboration.n.01', 'writer.n.01', 'tool.n.01', 'journey.n.01', 'paris.n.01', 'relation.n.01', 'layer.n.01', 'concept.n.01', 'metaphor.n.01']","['sculpture.n.02', 'economy.n.01', 'art.n.02', 'capital.n.02', 'repatriation.n.01', 'memorial.n.03']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/OSC_6881.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/OSC_6881-300x146.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/parthenon-marbles/,"['Cultural/20.740747797094553', 'Society/10.26628108733372', 'Individual_Personal/4.042105263157895']","['Cultural', 'Society', 'Individual_Personal']",35.049134147586166,"['Arts/15.18388505199651', 'Economy/6.005128205128205', 'History/2.6040100250626566']","['Arts', 'Economy', 'History']",23.79302328218737,"['Cultural/43.49439759586817', 'Society/26.36003075871497', 'Politics/14.438930659983297']","['Cultural', 'Society', 'Politics']",84.29335901456645,"['Arts/16.044372457607754', 'Economy/10.866715740399952', 'Culture/7.393162393162393']","['Arts', 'Economy', 'Culture']",34.304250591170096,0.6666666666666666,0.6666666666666666
Pedro Neves Marques,"The Pudic Relation between Machine and Plant shows a looped scene where a robotic hand touches a “sensitive plant” — Mimosa Pudica, a species characteristic for closing on itself when touched. The name of the plant was derived from Carl Linnaeus sexual taxonomy of plants: pudica referring both to the external sexual organs, shyness and modesty. In a poem written by Erasmus Darwin (Charles Darwin’s grandfather) titled The Loves of the Plants (1789), this plant is associated, jokingly, with British Botanist Joseph Banks’s famous sexual adventures during his botanical expedition to the tropics. Native to South America, today this sensitive plant is an invasive species in Southeast Asia, Australia and the Pacific, precisely the geography where Banks had his sexual adventures. The video, and its references, speaks to environmental colonialism, the heralding of so-called pioneers as producers of knowledge. The film perhaps speaks to a new frontier, the cultural colonization through technology. The film subtly references the past, and implores that we reconsider the previous methodologies in understanding sexuality, technology and science.","The work of writer, visual artist and filmmaker Pedro Neves Marques focuses on the politics of nature, in specific relation to ecology; economics; cultural production; and social and ontological segregation. In recent years, he has explored South American animist cosmologies, in order to understand current cosmopolitical transformations of both capitalism and anti-capitalist struggles. Marques is the editor of the book The Forest and the School/ Where to sit at the dinner table? (Archive Books and the Akademie der Kunste der Welt – Koln, 2015), an anthology on Antropofagia (literally, cannibalism) through the lens of anthropology and ecology in Brazil.",The Pudic Relation between Machine and Plant,Europe,"['plant.n.01', 'technology.n.01', 'love.n.01', 'cognition.n.01', 'british.a.01', 'native.a.01', 'movie.n.01', 'machine.n.01', 'united_states.n.01', 'celebrated.s.01', 'relation.n.01', 'write.v.01', 'south.n.01', 'hand.n.01', 'mention.n.01', 'cultural.a.01', 'scene.n.01', 'video.n.01']","['automaton.n.02', 'technology.n.01', 'botanic.a.01', 'sex.n.04', 'colonialism.n.01', 'ecology.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/PedroNevesMarques_thepudicrelationbetweenmachineandplant_2016_still3.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/PedroNevesMarques_thepudicrelationbetweenmachineandplant_2016_still3-300x168.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/the-pudic-relation-between-machine-and-plant/,"['Cultural/9.370588235294118', 'Society/5.737343358395989', 'Individual_Personal/2.857142857142857']","['Cultural', 'Society', 'Individual_Personal']",17.965074450832965,"['Technology/6.102614379084967', 'Inequality/2.5328025947220993', 'Colonization/1.7777777777777777']","['Technology', 'Inequality', 'Colonization']",10.413194751584843,"['Cultural/24.903007613301735', 'Individual_Personal/17.730525030525033', 'Material_Physical/13.997172418225055']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Material_Physical']",56.630705062051824,"['Land/11.349553370606003', 'Emotion/10.686080586080587', 'Technology/6.480882352941176']","['Land', 'Emotion', 'Technology']",28.516516309627765,0.6666666666666666,0.3333333333333333
Bruno Zhu,"Mr. Black, Mr. Navy, Mr. Stripes is a photographic series of opera gloves made of men’s tailored trousers that were presented in 2017 in “La Plage” in Paris, a shop window turned into an experimental art space. The personification of the objects named after characters intended to compose a fiction from the display. The project follows Zhu’s thinking on the definition of “queer”: how to express a state? Applied to a space (what he calls “queering the space”) allows him to talk about emotional space: Something soft that can collapse anytime and see that collapse as a potentiality to become new modes of being. For the visitors, this installation, seen as a soft sculpture, addressed the haptic sense, but can refer also to the semiology and the construction of myths. Using a fashion vocabulary resulting from his education in fashion design, Zhu ties a commentary on consumption as signifier of power and class.","Bruno Zhu (b. 1991, Porto, Portugal, currently based in London) explores his fascination for photography’s ambivalent symbol as surface and object, representation and appropriation. Transposed into 3D installation, he explores the mechanism of desire and identity, through the fictions implied in consumption and commodities. Flatness is a state that particularly interests the artist, from the page of a magazine, becoming an image-object creating an augmented reality. Intimacy is also a recurrent component of his work. He is currently working on a solo exhibition at the Kunsthalle Lisbon in 2018, based on the narrative of his parents, who are Chinese immigrants who arrived in the 80s in Portugal. They run a store in a small town of Portugal, in which Bruno Zhu curated several exhibitions with the complicity of the employees.","Mr. Black, Mr. Navy, Mr. Stripes",Europe,"['manner.n.01', 'space.n.01', 'shop.n.01', 'visitor.n.01', 'display.n.01', 'black.n.01', 'class.n.01', 'paris.n.01', 'design.n.01', 'fiction.n.01', 'compose.v.01', 'name.v.01', 'construction.n.01', 'photographic.a.01', 'power.n.01', 'sense.n.01', 'fictional_character.n.01', 'undertaking.n.01', 'sculpture.n.01', 'object.n.01', 'form.n.01', 'series.n.01']","['fashion.n.03', 'power.n.01', 'class.n.03', 'homosexuality.n.01', 'desire.n.02', 'consumption.n.03']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/LP-2017-Bruno-Zhu-001_crop.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/LP-2017-Bruno-Zhu-001_crop-300x213.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/mr-black-mr-navy-mr-stripes/,"['Individual_Personal/4.6', 'Politics/4.111655011655012', 'Society/2.618181818181818']","['Individual_Personal', 'Politics', 'Society']",11.329836829836829,"['Identity/2.8', 'Power/2.511655011655012', 'Emotion/1.0']","['Identity', 'Power', 'Emotion']",6.311655011655011,"['Cultural/27.243476621417805', 'Individual_Personal/10.488950411473633', 'Material_Physical/7.47800269905533']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Material_Physical']",45.21042973194677,"['Arts/13.550716440422324', 'Fantasy/7.96797385620915', 'Power/3.3116550116550116']","['Arts', 'Fantasy', 'Power']",24.83034530828649,0.3333333333333333,0.3333333333333333
Bady Dalloul,"Bady Dalloul’s Scrapbook is a 48 minute video beginning from his birth, tracing major global events of the 20th century, including the beginning and current Occupation and colonization of Palestine, the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, assassination of family members and the Syrian diaspora. A voice over follows these moments as the camera traces over the collage that includes text; photos; postcards; origami birds; and inserted videos of world leaders. The film is a letter to the viewer, imploring the witnessing of what we assume, but cannot know, to be the artist speaking. Here, the artist confounds the real and the fictional so as to escape from and reinvent the official narratives. In Japan the artist found a scrapbook whose pages were covered with little pieces of colored paper folded into origami, flattened and pasted. Dalloul kept it and here we find the source for a narrative intertwining the histories of Japan and Syria. In Hiroshima, he came across the story of Sadako, a young girl who suffered from leukemia as a result of the atomic bomb dropped on the city August 6, 1945. While dying she recalled the ancient legend that a person who makes a thousand orgami will have their greatest wish granted. Between the origami on yellowed pages are texts and images combining reality and fantasy as they address questions of war and political, military and economic decisions, and their impact on the fate of individuals. Using both authentic and fictional archives, this work also explores the fabrication of memory through imposed narratives. By adopting different forms and tones in his work, Dalloul explores the mechanisms and processes of authority and domination, of imperialism, that were part of the manipulation of the region’s historical narrative and memory, and its repercussions on the collective imagination.","The oeuvre of Bady Dalloul currently based in Paris, sophisticatedly and cunningly employs collage across various media: texts, drawings, video, and objects to produce powerful works commenting on the past and the present. His collages imply a construction, the fabrication of a space that is simultaneously autobiographical, critical, poetic and narrative. Thus, he makes narratives where the real and fiction, and individual and collective experiences, enter into a permanent dialogue questioning the official historical grand narratives. The artist conceived of a fragile book, tattered by time and long use. It’s a diary, and he has patiently filled every page. He has taken notes ever since his childhood spent in Paris and Damascus, cutting out and pasting in illustrations from history magazines and books to make up stories like Badland (1999–2004). His practice began as a way to keep busy and counter boredom and the incomprehensibility of the crisis that has held Syria in its grip for decades. For 5 years, he filled his notebooks with definitions, notes on events, information (scientific, geostrategic, military, economic and historical) and maps.

Kapwani Kiwanga,"Kapwani Kiwanga’s Linear Painting series (2017) reflect the artist’s research into disciplinary architecture, including schools, prisons, hospitals, and mental health facilities. When they were presented together, the paintings were arranged according to a black horizontal line placed at 160 centimeters from the floor, which traced the entire perimeter of the gallery. According to hygiene standards in Europe, this would mark the height below which walls should be washed in order to prevent the spread of illnesses. Consequently, hospital walls, much like society itself, have been divided into two zones: clean and infected, and thus two colors. Kiwanga’s choice of color reflects social hygiene movements and hospital reforms at the turn of the 20th century as well as the work of American author and consultant on color and color theory, Faber Birren. Birren’s works — an empiricist philosophy, which could be connected later to Behaviorism — explore the ways in which populations interact with colors and how institutions could manage human behavior with color.  The color schemes and proportions used by Kiwanga are intended to reproduce those used on the walls of specific institutions. These arrangements of color were believed to be conducive to some desired behavior: Peach-terra-cotta and blue-green combinations, for instance, were developed by a dedicated color theorist for a Chicago factory to help bolster the efficiency of workers, while the light turquoise of a Canadian mental hospital is said to have a calming effect. In this light, productivity and calm both resonate as staying in line. With a formal approach, the painting achieves a strong crystallization of institutional ideologies. The paintings are made on drywall, as if the original walls had been cut out and transported into the gallery, as direct witnesses of these histories.","Kapwani Kiwanga is a contemporary researcher, installation, video, photography, sound and performance artist currently based in Paris. Kiwanga’s work confuses truth and fiction in order to unsettle hegemonic narratives and create spaces in which marginal discourse can flourish. As a trained anthropologist and social scientist, the artist occupies the role of a researcher in her projects. Afrofuturism, anti-colonial struggle and its memory, scientific methodologies, belief systems, vernacular and popular culture are but some of the research areas which inspire her practice. Favoring research, scientific enquiry and unexplored anecdotes, Kiwanga’s practice is concerned less with objecthood than historical narratives and challenging patriarchal notions of truth and being. Throughout her practice, Kiwanga looks at the architecture of historical memory, exploring specifically the immateriality of symbols and structures. Her minimalist visual language, the research of Kiwanga is carefully curated and pertinently displayed, mixed with both sensible cynicism and a liberatory lyricism.",Linear Painting #5 – Saint Laurent du Maroni prison (Guiana),Europe,"['color.n.01', 'wall.n.01', 'institution.n.01', 'colors.n.01', 'factory.n.01', 'prison.n.01', 'witness.n.01', 'population.n.01', 'europe.n.01', 'scheme.n.01', 'agreement.n.04', 'strong.a.01', 'combination.n.01', 'direct.a.01', 'school.n.01', 'light.a.01', 'writer.n.01', 'worker.n.01', 'specific.a.01', 'formal.a.01', 'floor.n.01', 'approach.n.01', 'architecture.n.01', 'century.n.01', 'american.a.01']","['color.n.01', 'hospital.n.01', 'mental_health.n.01', 'school.n.01', 'imprisonment.n.01', 'behaviorism.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/2017_KK_-Linear-Painting-5-–-Saint-Laurent-du-Maroni-prison-Guiana.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/2017_KK_-Linear-Painting-5-–-Saint-Laurent-du-Maroni-prison-Guiana-157x300.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/linear-painting-5-saint-laurent-du-maroni-prison-guiana/,"['Cultural/5.590751388274608', 'Individual_Personal/4.983516483516484', 'Society/4.273432449903038']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Society']",14.84770032169413,"['Arts/2.42483660130719', 'Power/2.307692307692308', 'Community/1.8235294117647058']","['Arts', 'Power', 'Community']",6.556058320764204,"['Individual_Personal/11.400641025641029', 'Society/8.9981684981685', 'Cultural/6.76547127622979']","['Individual_Personal', 'Society', 'Cultural']",27.164280800039318,"['Spirituality/4.2153846153846155', 'Arts/3.4763071895424837', 'Community/3.3956043956043955']","['Spirituality', 'Arts', 'Community']",11.087296200531496,1.0,0.6666666666666666
David Horvitz,"The title of the work Eridanus refers to the constellation of the river of ancient Athens that meanders across in the night sky. The constellation is visible uniquely from the Southern Hemisphere. The artist evokes a story from the past, where with the installation of modern street lamps, has resulted in the residents of Paris being disturbed by the difficulty of seeing the stars in the sky as a result of light pollution.* Horvitz decided to restore a view of the stars in Paris by reducing the artificial light. In the process of realization, he crossed Paris on foot during the night, and transposed the constellation Eridanus on the map of the city. The artist extinguished a lamppost at each point representing the thirty stars of the constellation. At each point, the artist produced two photos—one with the light on and the artist visible, and one with the light off. The artist both procured and made keys that opened the control access panels for the streetlights, and simply turned off the switch. A few days later, the city had turned on the lights again. For an unknown duration, but for at least one night, an inverted constellation appeared in the city of Paris. A constellation, not of light, but of darkness, which in turn, resulted in some spots where the stars might, once again, be visible in the night sky. The artist began at 8 pm in Montrouge to finish at the Allen Gallery (the last lamppost being above the gallery) at 5am, the night of March 19, 2017. As the announcement for the exhibition, along with a card listing dates and location, Horvitz mailed copies of the keys, that enable one to open and turn off the street lamps, to the gallery’s mailing list.  *The artist later pointed out that this is only half true, that Parisians were also concerned with resisting the authority that imposed an end to dark corners of the city, ending the “visual  obscurity of shadows in the night.” Horvitz continues, “the streets, like everything else outside were once aligned with the rhythm of the sun and the moon’s light. When the sun set, the visible was allowed to rest, and in a sense, to dream. The light of a lamp makes visible only what is right in front of us. What is lost is a kind of cosmic distance. A night filled with stars evoking a time far beyond the human scale.”","Although the practice plays a central role in the work of David Horvitz, his work is at the opposite of fine art objects. The conceptual work of the artist employs various mediums necessary for each intervention; yet, performance, the idea of the game and the exchange with the public are central.

Julius Koller,"Wordplay was a central focus of Koller’s work, in particular the acronym U.F.O., which he adapted in his diagrammatic drawings to stand variously for Univerzálna Futurologická Organizácia (Universal Futurological Organization, 1972–3), Univerzálny Filozoficky Ornament (Universal Philosophical Ornament, 1978) or Underground Fantastic Organization (1975), and which also appeared in a series of slapsticky self-portraits titled ‘U.F.O.–naut’ (1970–2007). These infinite variations on a common cipher constituted an insistent incantation of the Utopian principle. Friedrich Nietzsche argued that to realize a fundamental critique of ‘bad faith’ means to move beyond cynicism and embrace a radical optimism that exceeds the petty dialectics of expectation and disappointment. In his approach to life and art as the U.F.O.–naut, Koller embodied precisely this: he actualized the potential of his imagination as a form of existential agency. As we get entangled in the strange possibilities of art and ideas, we all become U.F.O.–nauts and are deeply indebted to Koller, our patron saint of U.F.O.–nauts.","In its stringency, obsession and peculiarity, the oeuvre of Julius Koller is one of the most idiosyncratic and consistent in European art since the 1960s. Yet Koller is not only a seminal figure in the history of the neo- and post-avant-garde; his work has long been a critical inspiration for artists and intellectuals. In the most recent past, Koller’s concepts of the Anti-Happening, the Anti-Picture, the Universal-cultural Futurological Operation (U.F.O.), his actions, objects, texts and the enormous referential archive he built up, have attracted growing interest on the part of a broader art public.  From around 1960, in response to the modernist mainstream in Slovak art, Julius Koller began to develop his aesthetic position of the “antihappening.” His strategy consists in using real objects and everyday life as the predefined program for an aesthetic operation: from 1965, in texts rubberstamped on paper that refer to the context of the “anti-happening,” and then in 1967/1968 in pictures for which Koller used white latex paint instead of oils and which saw the first appearance of the question mark—the symbol of Koller’s brands of naming, or “making known,” that was later to undergo many mutations in various media and states of aggregation. The “invitation cards for an idea”—as Koller called the text works relating to the “anti-happenings”—and the palimpsests and serial arrangements of the “anti-pictures” set themselves apart from the academicism of Modernism in more than just formal terms. Koller foregoes every form of technical mastery.

Julius Koller,"The photograph Monologic – Yo-Yo 1, 2 (U.F.O.),(1982), shows Koller playing with a big white Yo-Yo in a drab concrete building among a group of tower blocks. For him, games like ping-pong or the yo-yo representsed the possibility of a more playful society in the face of socialist standardization.  Koller’s semiological manipulations of landscape and topography, of places and (his own) faces, investigate the possibilities of shifting meaning by the simplest alterations. In deadpan-humorist fashion, most poignantly displayed in a series of photo-portraits that cover a period of more than four decades, he systematically explores the relationship between art and alienation, or the idea of art as alienation. “U.F.O.-naut J.K.” becomes the artist’s altered ego, an extraterrestrial maker and distributor of universal signs: question marks, Ping-Pong balls, or wave lines, a more recent signature symbol, formed by tennis balls in a swimming pool in 1992 or drawn on the floor in the “antiperformance” Nova vaznost’, 1991.” (Tom Holert, Artforum, October, 2004).","In its stringency, obsession and peculiarity, the oeuvre of Julius Koller is one of the most idiosyncratic and consistent in European art since the 1960s.

Julius Koller,"This work is one of Koller’s many variations which he began to use from 1970 to describe the ‘cultural situations’ he created. His “Anti-Happenings” turned mundane events into ‘cultural’ and ‘subjective’ situations. He sought to create new cultural situations that weren’t new art, but rather new ways of living: a new creativity for a new humanistic culture. In the face of Communist ideology, subjectivity reclaimed its role with all of its poetry and discord.  The critic Jan Verwoert has commented on the significance of this constantly shifting reference: it ‘becomes a metaphor for the invasion of reality by the imagination. As such, it captures the essence of Utopian thought: to confront the microcosm of an actual state of affairs with the macrocosm of infinite possibilities – to show that society can be changed.’ (Jan Verwoert, ‘Július Koller: Kölnischer Kunstverein, Cologne, Germany’, Frieze no.79, November–December 2003, pp.98–9.)","In its stringency, obsession and peculiarity, the oeuvre of Julius Koller is one of the most idiosyncratic and consistent in European art since the 1960s.

Kristof Kintera,"Bad innovation in the name of protection is not a ready-made, but was made entirely by the artist, representing a stroller. Its interior is shielded and designed for babies in the case of conflict. Camouflaged, it resembles a small tank. Is it to protect or to attack? Is this object, full of ambiguity, for harmless babies or child soldiers? Privileged or excluded, this work alludes to survival and inequality faced by the question of life or death. The object materializes the primitive desire of protection induced by fear. How can we look at the world through this stroller? Is the pleasure of  seeing, breathing, feeling, still possible? Is it a shield to live, to survive or to go against life?","Kristof Kintera is a major artist of the contemporary Czech scene also with international acclaim. His works refer to doubts expressed in societies under authoritarian or communist regimes who find themselves in economic boom, yet leave behind local concerns. In the artist’s work, a sense of observation, often caustic, helps to establish a critical distance between oneself and the world, by using everyday objects cleverly diverted.

Valérie Jouve,"Like many contemporary photographers who play with the codes of realism, Valérie Jouve composes her images, having already a more or less predetermined result in mind, in order to deliver a complex representation of the world instead of a bold presentation of facts. A part of the series “Les Figures”, this “portrait’ of P. Faure carries a strong ambiguity, typical of the photographer’s images, between realism and mise-en-scene.  This photograph is exemplary of Valérie Jouve’s work: inscription of an inidual within an urban landscape, relation to architecture, simplicity of composition and strong, yet imprecise narrativity – related in part to seemingly familiar characters or places. The position of the body is somewhat sculptural enhancing the impression of suspended movement, reminding of Walking man by Giacommeti. This reference is underlined by the man’s attitude, looking down, introspectively. The character’s intensity places him on the surface, as if he were stuck onto the landscape. Despite his being namely identified, the man seems as anonymous as the undefined background behind him.","Valérie Jouve has significantly contributed to the development of contemporary photography in France in the 1990s, by drawing a complex portrait of the city, through her series “Les Paysages”(Landscapes), “Les Passants” (Passers by), “Les Personnages” (Characters), “Les Figures” (Figures), “Les Façades” (Facades) or “Les Situations” (Situations). She tries to identify the inidual within a sociologically determined community and shows the relation of the body to the city.“I am interested by the question of space above all. However, inscribing the figure inside space is not only a formal question as one may think. It is mostly about understanding how the figure can give a presence to what surrounds it. Here architecture plays the role of an emblematic space, used by man to exist. Building and character, perspective and figure: what is at stake is the discrepancy between collective and inidual conscience, considered in aesthetic terms”. (Interview with Michel Poivert, Bulletin de la SFP, 7e série-N°1, October 1997)The straightforwardness characterizing the images of Valérie Jouve, her use of large formats (creating a physical relationship to the spectator) and her interest for « mise en scene » liken her practice to a contemporary combination of documentary aesthetics and dramaturgy, illustrating a distant and sometimes strange relation to the world.Valérie  Jouve was born in St Etienne, France, in 1964.

Christian Jankowski,"In New York City’s Chinatown, subject Suat Ling Chua’s morning exercise is to practice the hula hoop. When Christian Jankowski first saw this woman he immediately got the idea to shoot Rooftop Routine. In the short video, Chua leads the group and dictates the movements that each participant has to repeat. Only one person of the group can directly see Chua and thus each person mimics another from roof to roof, altering the choreography after each passage like in a play of “Chinese whispers.” With this performance, Jankowski explores the social organization of a specific context. It brings together people of several buildings in the same project beyond isolation and social barriers of the urban environment. “In a work, new things, unknown things can happen. The important thing is to initiate a project to bring together the right people. Then the mechanism takes unpredictable paths. Until…voila!..the work is done,” says Jankowski.","Christian Jankowski’s practice ranges from photography, films, and performances, involving audiences or often people unfamiliar to contemporary art. He claims that his “main drive always comes from the pleasure of meeting people and working with them.” Through the manipulation of humor, collaboration, popular culture and magic, Jankowski creates links between art and people with a certain simplicity and relevance. Meeting with participants and making negotiations are an integral part of his work, as well as the elements of chance and accident. Jankowski’s work is about life as it is lived. His way of juxtaposing different worlds and subcultures as a way to explore social systems and their organization is both attractive and serious. In one of his early work My Life as a Dove (1996), the artist was transformed into a dove by a magician. This performance introduces one of the recurring themes of his work – transformation and how the artwork may change the way we perceive the world and its organization.Christian Jankowski was born in 1968 in Göttingen, Germany.

John Isaacs,"A child and dreamer my whole life long (broken tree) (2004) is a sculpture made of filler, wire, copper, oil paint, and wood depicting a tree just at it’s moment of breaking into half – one part alive with foliage and blooming branches and the other the crisp of the break exposed, with the trunk adhered solidly to a plinth. The sculpture appears to speak quite bluntly about Isaac’s own sense of bleak pessimism when exposing a severed tree, the universe’s sacred sign of life and birth. Through the perfect rendering of this encapsulated moment, Isaacs demonstrates the strength of the sculptural artifact and his interest in failure and fragility. It also denotes that a sculpture is capable of giving off a very emotive and sensory feeling in an instant– the crisp snap of life through the metaphor of the break of the tree.","John Isaacs’ work encompasses many different media, though much of it has origins in sculpture. The artist continually redefines his style, moving seamlessly through installation, sculpture, photography, film, painting and drawing. Whatever the media, Isaacs’ pieces typically inspire contemplation. Whether it is a grotesquely real, severed arm with the word HATE tattooed across its knuckles, or a small, painterly ink drawing of a unicorn, the artist’s work always contains a thread of mystical wonder and brutish reality. Through his often humorous mixing of appealing optimism with abject pessimism, Isaacs examines our historically and culturally determined conventions. In so doing, the artist makes no distinctions between high and low, finding instead that all things have their root in the same base instincts. In his work, there is a strong sense of the universal connection that underlies our apparent isolation from one another as well as the presence of dreams, successes and failures of the individual and society.

Fabrice Hyber,"The works of Fabrice Hyber provoke divergent ways of thinking. In a kindred spirit with Raymond Hains, image and writing are intertwined. Drawings and diagrams are visually direct, as shown in the series of “Peintures Homéopathiques” (“Homeopathic Paintings”), collages covered in transparent resin (1986-1988). In Cellman (2003) on the bottom right, stones and the arrows refer to skipping stones of “thinking”. A recurring human figure, commonly associated with Hyber’s theatrical world, is shown in Cellman and also L’homme de Bessines (1990). The artist uses writing as an engine of formal and semantic associations (“galet, galette, cellman, bulle, cellule “). The figure recalls that the body is a collection of cells. Like in the work Artère, le jardin des dessins ( Artery, the garden of drawings, a monument commissioned by Sidaction, Parc de la Vilette, Paris), the artist captures the inner workings of the body through schemas.","In each of his self-portraits, Fabrice Hyber (he removed the last “t” in Hybert in 2004) is elusive. This has been expressed in the photo “C’est le moment de se préparer à de nouvelles expériences” (It’s time to prepare for new experiences) (1987), or when we look at the upside down, hanging by one foot in “Traduction, le plus gros savon du monde” (Translation, the biggest soap in the world) (1991). “I? am an alien! ” says the artist. “Games and shifts are the only things able to face any kind of fundamentalism. Trade, commerce, image and poetry are means of osmosis. Through them gradually you can set up all of the ways to increase life beyond death. It is necessary to mix time, upgrade products, and imagine that works die in order to be assimilated then revisited. A work is absolutely not precognitive but always from here” said Fabrice Hyber in conversation with Thierry Laurent. Fabrice Hyber was born in 1961 in Luçon, France.

Shen Yuan,"Through a seemingly haphazard layering of glass and porcelain, Dérive is part of a larger installation series that address borders and displacement. Sheets of glass and porcelain, two transformational materials of alchemy, are stacked loosely in the shape of melting glaciers that places humans, animals, and nature in the same ecosystem. Migrations of one population into another and the subsequent displacement is emphasized in sharp, jagged edges of the transparent glass—phantasmagoric dreams of a distant place—the migration of not simply physical bodies but also that of political opinions and thoughts. Rigid yet fragile, porcelain and glass highlight that differences in language and habits also can form layers of invisible walls and barriers that are not initially obvious.","Born in Fujian Province, Shen Yuan studied Chinese painting at the Zhejiang Academy of Fine Arts as the first group of students admitted after the Cultural Revolution. Upon graduating in 1982, Shen participated in experimental art in Xiamen and exhibited the piece Water Bed in the controversial China/Avant Garde exhibition in Beijing 1989. Moving in 1990 to Paris with her partner, the artist Huang Yang Ping, Shen largely produced installation works that lament the melancholy of exile and consider themes of migration, language, and identity in contexts of cultural schism.  She simultaneously denounces the system of her education in China and reflects on the invisible cultural and political barriers she faces in Paris through the exploration of juxtaposing natural and man-made materials.

Ana Roldán,"Ana Roldán’s Displacements works use images taken from a 1970s exhibition catalogue for an exhibition called The Death in Mexico. Using pre-Columbian objects and other artifacts from Mexican history, the exhibition aimed to explore various representations of death in the Mexican cultural tradition. Roldán’s works begin with these rich black-and-white photographs and break them apart into fragments, slicing and dismembering the artifacts they depict. Puzzling the pieces back together in altered ways, Roldán’s resulting images reveal lines of fissure, gaps of black, and dislocations in form. These imperfections in the surface of her reconstituted artifacts relate to the imperfect processes of memory and the fragmented inheritance of knowledge and meaning.  Ana Roldán works in diverse media such as performance, sculpture, installations, video and collage.

María Buenaventura,"The Territory is not for sale is a process of reflection and research with people, thinkers and community leaders from Usme, a rural part of Bogotá on the tenuous verge of becoming urban. As an art object and installation, it comprises multiple stacks of paper each containing the decrees of land expropriation from many different peasant farmers who are being forced to sell their lots of land back to the government.  Usme lies at the southern urban-rural border strategically located next to the Páramo de Sumapaz, an enormous neo-tropical tundra ecosystem and water reserve. It had remained relatively isolated from the city-proper until 1954 when it became incorporated into Bogotá, triggering a process of residential densification through legal and illegal urbanization. Usme remains the very last green area for urban expansion.  The farmers do not want to sell because they want to keep their way of living, and even if some would want to become “urban citizens” they will not able to afford to do so given the absurd price offered for their land. While the problematic transformation of land from rural to urban, and the multiple forms of displacement lays in those stacked papers, there is also moments marked where inflicted communities rise above those struggles. To represent the mobilization of these communities, the artist has excised a section of each decree to plant the local crop or mineral from the area; as each plants grows from the stacks of paper, the decrees in turn begin to materially deteriorate.  In appreciating this work, it is helpful to understand the rapid growth and densification of Bogotá over the 20th century that has produced unequal urban development stamped by social divisions — the coexistence of informal and formal modes of survival, illegal and legal access to housing, and the blending of rural and urban lifestyles. Poor migrant workers fleeing Colombia’s 60-year armed conflict have settled in increasingly dense peripheries of the country’s capital, such as Ciudad Bolívar and Usme, thus informally extending the breadth of the city towards its southern borders at a rapid pace of growth. Most of them have purchased illegal plots of land from swindlers, built their houses by themselves and fought for infrastructure, equipment and services through political organizing.",,El territorio no está en venta,Americas,"['land.n.01', 'urban.a.01', 'community.n.01', 'plant.n.01', 'multiple.a.01', 'boundary_line.n.01', 'paper.n.01', 'procedure.n.01', 'transformation.n.01', 'struggle.n.01', 'life.n.02', 'district.n.01', 'represent.v.01', 'locate.v.01', 'worker.n.01', 'development.n.01', 'water.n.01', 'formal.a.01', 'local.a.01', 'contemplation.n.02', 'produce.v.01', 'house.n.01', 'century.n.01', 'government.n.01', 'document.n.01']","['land.n.01', 'exploitation.n.01', 'urbanization.n.01', 'expropriation.n.01', 'mobilization.n.01', 'community.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_DSC_8627-WEB.png,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_DSC_8627-WEB-300x199.png,https://kadist.org/work/el-territorio-no-esta-en-venta/,"['Politics/8.336990950226243', 'Society/7.936538461538461', 'Material_Physical/5.791208791208791']","['Politics', 'Society', 'Material_Physical']",22.064738202973498,"['Power/4.06923076923077', 'Land/3.4835164835164836', 'Inequality/3.467760180995475']","['Power', 'Land', 'Inequality']",11.02050743374273,"['Society/28.289885114885124', 'Cultural/21.08463409655361', 'Material_Physical/21.030855419090717']","['Society', 'Cultural', 'Material_Physical']",70.40537463052945,"['Urbanization/12.079995004995007', 'Land/11.060073260073262', 'Arts/5.840196078431372']","['Urbanization', 'Land', 'Arts']",28.98026434349964,0.6666666666666666,0.3333333333333333

Deimantas Narkevicius,"The Dud Effect is a film that revisits the fear of nuclear attacks during the Cold War by staging the firing of a R-14 missile by a solitary soldier on the site of a real Soviet launch base installed in Lithuania. For this film, Deimantas Narkevicius used no animation or 3D effects, instead it is the silence of the place interrupted by the voice of the Russian soldier (who truly served on a military base in Lithuania) that creates this worrying atmosphere in which the execution of such an act becomes possible. The War Game (1965) by Peter Watkins was a source of inspiration, since he displays a personal and collective concern about the danger of the nuclear arms race in the United Kingdom in the 1960s.","Deimantas Narkevicius is a key figure in the Lithuanian art scene today. He has had many important retrospective exhibitions, at the Reina Sofia, Van Abbemuseum and Kunsthalle Bern, and he represented Lithuania at the 2001 Venice Biennale. He received the Vincent Award with Francis Alys in 2008. Trained as a sculptor, Deimantas Narkevicius then developed his work towards narrative through film and video. He considers History as central to his practice, as live material; he plays on the double meaning of the term history, by relating his personal story with that of his country. As witness to the dismantling of the Soviet bloc and the radical changes to society after the declaration of independence, Deimantas Narkevicius concentrates on the evocation and deconstruction of this heritage. Once in the XX Century (2005) has become emblematic of his work. There are images of Lenin, suspended above a crowd in Vilnius, which were shown a thousand times on CNN in the last ten years as symbolic of the collapse of the Soviet Union and the failure of Communism. But the manipulation operated during the editing process makes it seem as though the crowd is waiting and celebrating the installation of Lenin’s sculpture. « Therefore there is something frightening in the possible repetition of a past that isn’t so distant. » Deimantas Narkevicius. These films retrace the history of a country via a variety of places and portraits : a power plant, an abandoned nuclear missile base, a woman who survived the Vilnius ghetto, the official sculptor of Marx’s effigy, the Lithuanian actor Donatas Banionis filmed 40 years after his appearance in the film Solaris by Tarkovskij. Deimantas Narkevicius deconstructs the linearity of history. The narrative belongs both to the past and the present which is emphasized by the use of techniques and stylistic principles typical of amateur films of the 1970s. These fictional documentaries are made with old equipment rather like what was used to make propaganda cinema during the Soviet era, but the distance permitted by fiction allows him to bring the discourse up to date.Deimantas Narkevicius was born in 1964 Utena, Lithuania.

Martin Boyce,"In the installation Our Love is like the Flowers, the Rain, the Sea and the Hours, Martin Boyce uses common elements from public gardens – trees, benches, trashbins– in a game which describes at once a social space and an abstract dream space. The trees, unique sources of light in the exhibition space, produce their own environment. These sculptures, as if extracted from a set, are enough to suggest an atmosphere, a landscape, or a movie. Their nocturnal depiction is ambivalent, hovering between poetic beauty and the potential threat of a park at night. Romantic views of nature blend with modern ideas of optimism and equality. However, from it emerges from a deep anxiety or paranoia. The perceived space cannot be localized inside a certain reality, rather it pertains to the everyone’s imagination. Therefore, in the installation, the viewer produces what he sees around him with his own eyes and own journey through the space. Its space becomes the psychological and emotional space of an idler. When describing the piece, Boyce has stated that the sculptures move far from the visible and the material generating more of an emotional state rather than theoretical reflection.  “My installations draw upon imaginary and fragmented landscapes. When I introduce an object within an installation, it recalls the world from where it is derived from, like a fragment, it is a exploded variation.” The universe of Martin Boyce is multifarious, extracting fragments of reference as varied as architecture, design, cinema, Scottish literature, Japanese poetry, etc. His forms do not fit perfectly within one category and exist more as ghosts of meaning. For instance, a sculpture can distinctly resemble a tilted ping-pong table although all the elements deviate from such a table to a great extent. Concrete trees by Joel and Jan Martel made in 1925 for the Decorative Arts Exhibition in Paris are a recurrent theme throughout the work of Boyce, as well as replicas in “Electric trees and telephone booth” (2006) and formal traces in works such as “We are still and reflective” (2007). The artist sees these objects as a perfect “collapse” between architecture and nature. The sculptures, consisting of trees, gates, vents, signs, dot the exhibition space, becoming a stage. While the forms and materials from were conceived to be functional, Martin Boyce uses them less as objects of representation and more as objects of emotion. Their titles, extracted from fragments of poems, pop songs, slogans, exist as a way to “inhabit” the installations and poeticize the real.","“My installations draw upon imaginary and fragmented landscapes.

Ceal Floyer,"NO POSITIONS AVAILABLE is composed of panels covering the entire wall of the gallery exemplifying one of the tendencies of the artist. The “billboard sign,” like a ready-made, plays with the different meanings of the title, literally and abstractly. The repetition of the sign, as it has used in Minimal and Conceptual art, fills the space. On a more abstract level, Floyer like Jonathan Monk and Mario Garcia Torres, explores the possibility of reformulating historical proposals from the 60s and 70s.

Katinka Bock,"«I will put two heavy stones in my jacket pockets that way my body will sink deep like a deflated truck tire, no one will notice», this excerpt from “Quay West” by Koltès could echo the story depicted by Katinka Bock: the shipwreck of a small boat full of stones. The grain of the image and the framing evoke distant times, maybe the origins of cinema and the footage of the Lumière brothers. The operator’s gaze creates a landscape undetermined in space and time. An encounter between density and liquid: the effect produced is strange and paradoxical since the rocks are floating, temporarily denying gravity. It is also an aesthetic study of the liquid and the mineral, a confrontation between the fluid and the rough, a combination of the wave and the shape.","The city, the landscape and the exhibition space are Katinka Bock’s favored playgrounds. Her installations, sculptures, films and photographs question the spaces of action and representation, in their daily and political use, through the prism of aesthetics and poetry. Katinka Bock makes changes to the landscape. In « Sol d’incertitude » (2006) the artist removes (Parisian cobblestones), quotes (a history of mobility), and modifies (tar coating). These actions function as small rituals. « Das Konservat » (2003), a 3 meter high wooden fence enclosing 2500 square meters of grass, acts like a cutting in the landscape, reminiscent perhaps of the ‘temenos’ (in Ancient Greece, sacred space in open air dedicated to a god).  Although Bock’s objects are visually mute, they tell stories.

Katinka Bock,"Like with other works of the artist, with First Piano Katinka Bock tried to go against the rules of use of clay, that is, by forcing the material to the extreme, and transferring the resulting elements into a cubic shaped volume. Thus, the resulting accumulated strata brings back the material to its very essence, the earth.","The city, the landscape and the exhibition space are Katinka Bock’s favored playgrounds. Her installations, sculptures, films and photographs question the spaces of action and representation, in their daily and political use, through the prism of aesthetics and poetry. Katinka Bock makes changes to the landscape. In « Sol d’incertitude » (2006) the artist removes (Parisian cobblestones), quotes (a history of mobility), and modifies (tar coating). These actions function as small rituals. « Das Konservat » (2003), a 3 meter high wooden fence enclosing 2500 square meters of grass, acts like a cutting in the landscape, reminiscent perhaps of the ‘temenos’ (in Ancient Greece, sacred space in open air dedicated to a god).  Although Bock’s objects are visually mute, they tell stories. For the exhibition « Kanon » (La Synagogue de Delme, 2008), a drama of materials occurred; the sculptures were transformed into still lives, with a fragile monumentality.

Michal Chelbin,"Michal Chelbin’s staged yet intimate portrait photographs, seduce the viewer into uncomfortable, voyeuristic complicity with the camera. Several works represent adolescent girls on the verge of sexual consciousness, their bodies still that of a child while their gaze directly confronts the viewer implying differently. Michal Chelbin shoots in a format of utter stability-the square. She positions her subjects well within the frame where visual clarity prevails. Angelina and her father, Israel belongs to the “Strangely Familiar” series where she shifted form shooting in the studio to the outside world, from theatrical to found light. In this work, an athletic but vulnerable-looking man holds his daughter in front of a swamp, poised as if offering her to the viewer.  Though the photographs remain staged and her efforts directorial, Chelbin has sublimated the work’s mythic aspects by exploring a world of characters that lend themselves readily to the romantic-the world of athletes, ballroom dancers, and performers in small traveling shows and circuses, mostly in Eastern Europe, but also in Israel and England. With little supporting information to go on, we reflexively fill in the blanks and ride the images’ narrative momentum wherever it leads. Much of the time taking us to places steeped in discontinuity, incongruity, ambiguity.

Jordan Wolfson,"Dreaming of the dream of the dream is a 16mm projection consisting of images of waves that come and go continuously. The artist has assembled extracts of cartoons in which water is visible (the sea, bubbles, a stream, waves, etc.). Somewhat nostalgic, these extracts can recall either childhood cartoons or paintings by Hokusai. The continuous movement of the waves echoes the presentation of the film which also loops: a metaphor of life, a cyclical and continuous movement which nevertheless cannot be altered. The more the film is shown, the more the images become worn. The images progressively disappear with the scratches on the print. In fact, the work itself has a limited lifespan since the artist insists that the film should never be copied and that it should be shown until the images have entirely disappeared. Once the work is ‘dead’, only documentation will remain as in the case of a performance. Even though the images are the same, everyone has a different experience of the work until it erases and self-destructs completely only to remain in our memory.","Jordan Wolfson is often defined as a romantic conceptualist indeed his work tends to subvert material conditions of the art world and question contemporary socio-cultural or religious stereotypes with a great deal of highly strung melancholy, humor or cynicism. Between fact and fiction, Wolfson’s practice involves film, text and graphics, sound and animations. The poetic forms arrived at are ambiguous, tautological and often anxiously psychological constructs. He scrutinizes popular culture for his pinpointed iconoclastic artworks. Some of his now famous references are to Charlie Chaplin, Michael Jackson, Christopher Reeve, Rodgers and Hammerstein lyrics, Eric Satie’sGymnopédie, the Semite.

Matti Braun,"During a residency in 2009 at L’appartement 22 in Rabat, the artist traveled in Morocco and Senegal on the traces of the German sculptor Arno Breker. On this occasion he learned about batik, a fabric printing technique which originates not only from Indonesia but also from Senegal. It is also widespread in Africa. The artist was inspired by the printed motifs to make a series of batiks, Untitled, on which the white on black motifs recall European geometric abstraction. By re-appropriating these handcrafted traditional techniques (batik, Japanese ink and wash, blown glass, woodcuts, painting on ceramic…) Matti Braun displaces their usage and their context at the same time and reveals the porousness between different cultures that interpenetrate. Thus the artist aims to shed troubled light on different histories by operating these correspondences between forms and past knowledge, present and future.","Matti Braun’s work entails research and experienced wanderings during sojourns and journeys. He explores heterogeneous data. Their junction generates rapports with other geographic and cultural eras, sometimes in anachronistic ways. Matti Braun is interested in different cultures and particularly in the multiple physical and conceptual migrations they have experienced. The creative process results in in-depth research regarding the interpretations about these different cultures. The images and the forms are utilized in a narrative while maintaining an enigmatic dimension.Matti Braun was born in Berlin in 1968.

Anna Molska,"Perspective was filmed during a residence in northern Poland. The film is preceded by a series of photographs made ??in her studio. In a snowy landscape, the artist walks towards the horizon secured by ropes. The film records the appearance of a geometric construction that unfolds in space, but also the physical effort of the artist to create it. Finally, she reaches a climax when the strings form a perspective on the landscape. At the same time, freed from the studio, but still a prisoner of the ropes, the more she walks, the space extends further.  The piece features a physical struggle to reach the horizon, and the ideal point where the hypothetical perspective lines meet. The film reveals the impossibility of art to reflect both dimensions in a two-dimensional space as if the perspective tools developed in the Renaissance are no longer allowed to read the world.","Anna Molska uses video performance to explore the effect of artistic culture on the production of art. She rethinks the historical traditions of the Russian-Polish avant-garde in a question of the role of the artist who, beyond the organization of forms in space, participate in the construction of society. She questions the validity of art tools to produce new concepts and territoires.  Anna Molska was born in 1983 in Prudnik, Poland.

Laurent Montaron,"This film refers directly and fictionally to one of the first media dramas: the burning of the Zeppelin aircraft LZ 129 Hindenburg as it landed in New York in 1937. The power of these images, which were widely diffused in the press, had a profound haunting impact on people’s consciousness. This mode of transport – both futuristic and obsolete – crystallizes a collective imaginary which was fed by cinematic, literary and mythological fiction as Barthes would put it. A mass advances progressively towards the spectator, the camera glides right up to this monster, which is as graceful as a sea mammal, but flames perturb this vision. The mass disappears from view, making it impossible to define clearly, and finally exits the image field. Realized with an anaglyph process – which superimposes two slightly offset images to produce an effect of depth – the film prevents the experience of the third dimension and emphasizes the tricks of fabrication since it is viewed without special glasses. Due to its materiality and blurriness, the image, which is accompanied by a sinusoid wave, exerts a powerful haptic and hypnotic fascination.","Using a variety of media – photography, film, sound, installation, sculpture – Laurent Montaron’s work ‘renders an image’ in Mélancolia (2005) the magnetic band of an echo chamber endlessly loops and unwinds to become a hypnotic serpentine line. ‘To render an image’ can be understood in the sense of crystallizing a set of archetypes and fantasies in a sensory mental representation. In the film Readings (2005), a researcher at the astronomical observatory in Meudon observes his bloody hand caused by the tooth he has just lost in a suspended space-time. “I would say that I construct my images like scenes in which the beginning and the end are missing, in which the scenario is contained in a very short lapse of time. They are often like a film still with no attached synopsis” according to Laurent Montaron. These images are formed within a time warp, a ‘rupture’ (Georges Didi-Huberman), a concept which is also present iconographically in BALBVTIO (2009, two identical films, shot differently, projected simultaneously). Each one of the artist’s works necessitates a particular attention span, different for every spectator.

Sara Eliassen,"Sara Eliassen’s video work A Blank Slate (2014) employs cinematic effect to investigate the relationships between subjectivity, gaze, and memory. Set in a sleepy and unidentified coastal town, the film begins as the protagonist unexpectedly finds herself inside a hotel room in a lucid state. Attempting to grasp her surroundings, she falls into a deeper metaphysical reality where her memories blur with her awareness of her surroundings until she finds herself again alone in a dream-like state. As she leaves her room, she walks through a nighttime boardwalk of carnival games and boarded-up shops, weaving through the thin crowd of revelers with an over determined gait. The camera follows her in reverse shot, trying to keep pace with her speeding and erratic pace. Suddenly, she arrives at a Ferris wheel and gets into a car; the ride begins, and the camera focuses on her in close-up as she looks off into the distance, her expression at once detached and intensely aware. In a scene borrowed from Japanese author Haruki Murakami’s 2000 novel Sputnik Sweetheart, the woman sees herself having sex with a man through a distant window of her own hotel room. Scenes of female characters from film history are interspersed between these moments of surreal dissonance, creating a heightened sense of temporal disjunction. These disjointed shifts of perspective and narrative represents a decisive attempt to disrupt what theorist Laura Mullvey describes as the “male gaze” inherent to visual culture, and in these moments of fragmentation, A Blank Slate offers a compelling meditation on how media-based cultures shape how we define our subjectivities and, by extension, ourselves.","Sara Eliassen is a conceptual filmmaker working in video, drawing, installation, and public practice. Her films often question the notion of self and that of the audience’s gaze, as typically positioned in society. She uproots expectations of narrative structures in cinema, often using iconic cinematic moments as departure points for her investigations of the viewer-character dynamics and of collective memory in film.

Sarah Lai Cheuk Wah,"Back images is a series of six photographs by Sarah Lei Cheuk Wah that explore the semiotics of power and their intersection with representations of masculinity. The photographs feature what seem to be stock images of several policemen—their rugged uniforms, vehicles and weapons drenching the photographs with signs of masculinity and power as the policemen carry on with their usual tasks. The series was part of a larger exhibition entitled In Stasis where Lei transformed the booth of an art fair into what appeared to be a security area inside an airport. Inside the booth, two live security guards occupy the space, sitting, moving around and taking turns to sporadically rearrange a couple of retractable belt stanchions. In addition to the photographs and the guards, Lei included a video of a security uniform shoe being polished as well as a painting of the shoe and black shoe polish. When seen together the works are playful depictions of ubiquitous forms of power, surveillance and control, which take on an additional meaning in a post 9/11 context.","Sarah Lai Cheuk Wah is best known for her paintings of common objects and urban landscapes, which she renders realistically in great detail. Her visual language is derived from the ordinary, the mundane and the everyday. Whether a lamp, a slice of butter, a street roundabout, the sea or the moon, Lai captures and subtly modifies what she describes as “the things that go unnoticed.” Her paintings are characterized by soft, delicate shades of pale tones that give the images a hazy, dream-like quality—as if the fading colors had been bleached by the sun or the passing of time. Although Lai was originally trained as a painter, her work reaches beyond the space of a frame, often incorporating found objects, sculptural elements and videos alongside the paintings and playfully placing all the disparate but related elements. In terms of her process, she describes the action of painting as meditative, as a state of mind that allows her reflection, introspection and enables her to build a relationship with the world.",Back images,Asia,"['power.n.01', 'photograph.n.01', 'surveillance.n.01', 'control.n.01', 'playful.a.01', 'feature.n.01', 'sign.n.01', 'series.n.01', 'image.n.01', 'representation.n.01', 'meaning.n.01', 'black.a.01', 'context.n.01', 'undertaking.n.01', 'space.n.01', 'form.n.01', 'video.n.01']","['power.n.01', 'surveillance.n.01', 'maleness.n.01', 'security.n.06', 'weapon.n.01', 'police.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/sarah_lai_dsc09866_b_copy.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/sarah_lai_dsc09866_b_copy-300x201.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/back-images/,"['Cultural/3.980392156862745', 'Politics/3.511655011655012', 'Individual_Personal/3.466666666666667']","['Cultural', 'Politics', 'Individual_Personal']",10.958713835184424,"['Technology/3.980392156862745', 'Power/2.511655011655012', 'War/1.8571428571428572']","['Technology', 'Power', 'War']",8.349190025660615,"['Individual_Personal/24.070518679806614', 'Cultural/16.581765783236374', 'Politics/8.66965256965257']","['Individual_Personal', 'Cultural', 'Politics']",49.32193703269556,"['Mind/8.923809523809526', 'Culture/6.3769230769230765', 'Power/6.091874791874792']","['Mind', 'Culture', 'Power']",21.392607392607395,1.0,0.3333333333333333
Scott Reeder,"Reeder’s works often start with language—and his Pasta Paintings are no different. After the phrase for the title came through his head, the artist set about trying to figure out how to make a mark with pasta. These paintings are the result, made using the pasta as something of a stencil, with the paint being applied after the noodles have been scattered on the painting’s blank surface. The serene, patterned surfaces that this process creates are at odds, somewhat, with the simplicity and the absurdity of their making.","Detroit-based artist Scott Reeder threads his multimedia works through with humor and a dry sense of irony. His output ranges widely, and includes sculpture, painting, and curatorial projects among other things. No matter his medium, there is always a certain acerbic wit to Reeder’s work—a wit that can be both blithe and slightly confrontational. It’s a sense of humor that, as an artist, he traces back to the visual puns of Duchamp, or to the simple, deadpan forms of John McCracken and Blinky Palermo. For Reeder, the punch line is often the practice of making art itself; he mines the absurdity of the artist’s life for works that speak both comically and poignantly, at times, to the creative process.",Untitled (Pasta Painting),Americas,"['surface.n.01', 'phrase.n.01', 'mark.n.01', 'head.n.01', 'put.v.01', 'paint.n.01', 'consequence.n.01', 'procedure.n.01', 'title.n.01']","['medium.n.05', 'wit.n.01', 'food.n.01', 'surface.n.02', 'sarcasm.n.01', 'procedure.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/img_scott_reeder_untitled_pasta_painting_sr157web.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/img_scott_reeder_untitled_pasta_painting_sr157web-230x300.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/untitled-painting/,"['Cultural/8.252747252747252', 'Society/6.514285714285713', 'Individual_Personal/6.023376623376623']","['Cultural', 'Society', 'Individual_Personal']",20.79040959040959,"['Spirituality/3.257142857142857', 'Culture/2.6571428571428575', 'Emotion/1.9090909090909092']","['Spirituality', 'Culture', 'Emotion']",7.823376623376624,"['Cultural/15.11775479422539', 'Society/10.424542124542127', 'Individual_Personal/4.114285714285715']","['Cultural', 'Society', 'Individual_Personal']",29.65658263305323,"['Economy/4.028937728937729', 'Arts/3.9717948717948723', 'Spirituality/3.257142857142857']","['Economy', 'Arts', 'Spirituality']",11.257875457875457,1.0,0.3333333333333333
Shay Arick,"Part of a series of videos called LIFE, where Shay Arik videos that re-enact iconic journalistic photographs. As explained by the video’s title, the departure point for LIFE #1 is the iconic 1943 photograph published by Life magazine that captures Japanese officer Yasuno Chikao from the Imperial Japanese Navy as he raises his sword, seconds before publically beheading Australian war commando Leonard Siffleet in the shores of Papua New Guinea. In Arick’s restaging there are no onlookers in the scene, the only two figures represented are Chikao and Siffleet: the perpetrator and victim of this fatal act of violence. The two subjects in the video assume the poses akin to the original photograph and remain still for the whole duration of the work, their act of endurance interlacing testimony, history, and temporality.","Violence is key to Shay Arick’s practice who employs photography, sculpture, performance, video and drawing as means to understand what motivates people to enact it. Born in Israel, the now Brooklyn-based artist has experienced the lasting effects of growing up surrounded by decades of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and hence strives to make work that fosters empathy and dialogue. Often taking cues from archives or historical sources, Arick restages or re-interprets iconic cultural imagery and historical moments to expose the absurdity in the constructs and taboos that can drive socio-political conflicts. Whether through composite photographs of hands throwing rocks during armed conflicts, a body of work concerned with violence perpetrated against animals, or a series exploring violence and masculinity through the biblical story of David and Goliath, his work invites us to reflect and contemplate, from the perspective of both victim and perpetrator, about a brutality that appears to be an inevitable condition of our humanity.","LIFE #1, a reenactment of a Japanese officer who is about to behead an Australian flier.

Motoyuki Shitamichi,"Motoyuki Shitamichi launched his Torii project in 2006. He proceeded to visit and photograph torii that are situated outside Japan’s current national border. Expansionist Japan constructed numerous torii during its occupation of the Northern Mariana Islands (now a U.S. territory), Northeast China (former Manchuria), Taiwan, South Korea, and Sakhalin (the eastern most area of Russia). Shitamichi’s work shows that, after World War II, the torii structures and their uses changed to suit local cultures and lifestyles in the respective countries. In Saipan, torii remain intact at cemeteries; those in South Korea have been destroyed and no longer exist. In Taichung City, a torii is laid on its side and used as a park bench. Many of the torii, which represent a symbolic shape in Shintoism, lost their significance. In this way, Shitamichi focuses on how symbolic shapes can be transformed into simple objects.  Traditionally torii are considered as barriers (borders) to distinguish the sacred from the secular. In fact, Shitamichi’s torii project is synonymous with his discussions about borders. Torii located outside Japan’s national border look different depending on the historical view, political situation, and culture of respective countries. The difference is attributed not only to the regime and large events such as war, but also to the gradual change in people’s daily lives. As life continues, memories of large events gradually fade due to the accumulation of small events. The consecution of small events transforms the landscape before people realize it. The torii that Shitamichi focuses on in this series encompass the time series in terms of both large historical events and small personal events. He borrows the landscape to provide the audience with opportunities to contemplate upon the visible/invisible, existent/nonexistent borders. In general, the Japanese people are too sensitive or try to distance themselves from issues regarding the national border, territory, and state, because they are not accustomed to focusing on such issues. Shitamichi boldly takes up these issues and quietly upsets the concept of “Japan” or “the Japanese people.” His works reveal relative, fluid, and personal borders that are different from those created by political ideologies or historical objectivity.","After graduating from Musashino Art University in 2001, Shitamichi traveled for four years throughout Japan and took photographs of war remains.  The photographs were published in his book Bunkers, published by Littlemore in 2005. Shitamichi feels strongly that seeing and feeling the actual thing is important, which allows him to explore the memory of scenery and to determine what fades away and what stays. He uses photographs, writings, diagrams and maps to illustrate the scenery through the aspects of archeology and presence. His work has been exhibited widely in Japan.",torii series,Asia,"['boundary_line.n.01', 'japan.n.01', 'event.n.01', 'national.a.01', 'issue.n.01', 'district.n.01', 'people.n.01', 'historical.a.01', 'japanese.a.01', 'symbolic.a.01', 'south.n.01', 'personal.a.01', 'state.n.04', 'shape.n.01', 'war.n.01', 'undertaking.n.01', 'culture.n.01', 'political.a.01', 'landscape.n.01', 'transform.v.01', 'occupation.n.01', 'opportunity.n.01', 'change.n.01', 'current.a.01', 'life.n.01']","['sacred.a.01', 'landscape.n.01', 'change.n.02', 'postwar.a.01', 'margin.n.01', 'custom.n.02']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/img_shitamichi_motoyuki_torii_saipan_2.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/img_shitamichi_motoyuki_torii_saipan_2-300x202.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/torii-series/,"['Material_Physical/2.8', 'Society/2.7222222222222223', 'Individual_Personal/1.8']","['Material_Physical', 'Society', 'Individual_Personal']",7.322222222222222,"['History/1.8333333333333335', 'Spirituality/1.0', 'Land/1.0']","['History', 'Spirituality', 'Land']",3.8333333333333335,"['Society/32.7071013953367', 'Material_Physical/29.11489621489622', 'Individual_Personal/23.269944090996734']","['Society', 'Material_Physical', 'Individual_Personal']",85.09194170122966,"['Land/17.03028083028083', 'Urbanization/10.275702075702076', 'Spirituality/7.9673992673992675']","['Land', 'Urbanization', 'Spirituality']",35.273382173382174,1.0,0.6666666666666666
Shooshie Sulaiman,"Shooshie Sulaiman’s pictures of unidentified figures initially appear alien and even monstrous: rendered hairless in unusual and even sickly colors, they stand in stark contrast to the aesthetic ideals of conventional portraiture. The subject in Dulu atas pedestal, sekarang dalampedestal / Before on pedestal, now inside (2005), a ball point pen and charcoal rendering of a bald figure with a wide-eyed stare, appears caught in a distressingly static state, at once both uncomfortable and yet incapable of ameliorating his condition. Sulaiman’s subject here becomes an almost frightening sight, the emotive brush strokes replaced by the ball point pen’s erratic black lines, the eyes and mouth scribbled over in a deliberately defacing gesture. Red arrows and strange lines of text jut out from his face, and a splotch of red seeps out from the scribbled black lines around his mouth, suggesting unspoken traumas made all the more prescient by the confining black box around his head, a motif that echoes British painter Francis Bacon’s use of cube-like shapes in his “scream” portraits. Sulaiman’s paintings, on many levels, foreground bodies as vulnerable sites. At the same time, her work also responds to contemporary practices that privilege branding and commerce over creative originality. Sulaiman’s work effectively translates psychological anxieties endemic to nation building traumas in contemporary Malaysia, the result of a nascent free market economy and its social effects. Her commitment to analog technique represents a decisive injunction against the mass-produced that gestures towards freer expressiveness through artistic practice.","Shooshie Sulaiman is one of the leading creative practitioners in Southeast Asia. Her work develops in various forms, from site-specific installations and outdoor performances, to a daily practice of writing and drawing. She started her artistic practice during the 1990’s, when Malaysia opened to the free market and became more international, not without psychological impact on its society.

Steffani Jemison,"In Escaped Lunatic, a steady stream of figures run across the screen, sprinting, jumping, and rolling through the streets of Houston. The work is part of a trilogy that borrows its narrative structure from early-20th-century cinema. The artist employs the chase genre, which has often depicted African Americans in scenes of flight from various forms of authority. Jemison, who shot the video with a Houston-based parkour team while she was living in that city, links this narrative structure to a contemporary scene, boldly connecting the unjust conditions of urban life and representation of the black community across time. As the figures move quickly across the screen, they not only appear as doppelgangers of each other, but together become symbols of fugitivity—figures of escape that historically mark black life.","Steffani Jemison is an interdisciplinary artist whose work considers issues that arise when conceptual practices are inflected by black history and vernacular culture. She uses rigorous formal methods to explore her interests in the politics of serial form, the limits of narrative description, and the tension between improvisation, repetition, and fugitivity.",Escaped Lunatic,Americas,"['screen.n.01', 'narrative.s.01', 'structure.n.01', 'black.a.01', 'figure.n.01', 'scene.n.01', 'film.n.02', 'african.a.01', 'life.n.01', 'picture.v.02', 'symbol.n.01', 'community.n.01', 'urban.a.01', 'street.n.01', 'representation.n.01', 'contemporary.s.01', 'city.n.01', 'form.n.01', 'time.n.01', 'video.n.01']","['black.n.05', 'racism.n.01', 'inequality.n.01', 'discrimination.n.01', 'culture.n.01', 'authority.n.02']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/img_escaped_lunatic_02_web.jpeg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/img_escaped_lunatic_02_web-300x169.jpeg,https://kadist.org/work/escaped-lunatic/,"['Politics/7.369281045751634', 'Society/2.659090909090909', 'Material_Physical/1.6']","['Politics', 'Society', 'Material_Physical']",11.628371954842542,"['Inequality/7.369281045751634', 'Community/1.7840909090909092', 'Environmental/1.6']","['Inequality', 'Community', 'Environmental']",10.753371954842542,"['Cultural/24.487052000287306', 'Society/15.652467140702438', 'Material_Physical/14.899928176398769']","['Cultural', 'Society', 'Material_Physical']",55.039447317388515,"['Urbanization/9.731221719457015', 'Media/8.953443941679236', 'Arts/8.224542124542126']","['Urbanization', 'Media', 'Arts']",26.909207785678376,0.6666666666666666,0.0
Moshekwa Langa,"In “Untitled II (Mapping text)”, 2009, Langa abstracts language in an attempt to change the familiar into the absurd. With reference to comic speech bubbles, Langa combines in a sea of blue gouache a series of nuanced references to identity and politics with “Black Maria” alongside nostalgic and subtle phrases such as “mom be with me, I need u now” and “I didn’t listen.” Through this gathering of references “Untitled II (Mapping text)” forges a poetic and vulnerable site to engage with his personal experiences while simultaneously suggesting the senseless structure of language. This work resonates to larger world of art, politics and popular culture through layering assorted references, piling up meanings that are cryptic and ambivalent, yet resonant with multiple interpretations. With his drawings and gouaches Langa illustrates how creativity is the freedom to make connections. Using abstract expression, free association and stream of consciousness, his work is fortuitously created. Drawing from daily life, routine, boredom and indifference as his influences, Langa emphasizes the viewing-experience as a sensuous and seductive process in the creation of meaning. “Untitled II (Mapping text)” documents the rituals of sangomas, grieving, gossip and love, mapping the artist’s encounters, using slogans and poetic epigrams to bring together scraps and residues of history.","The oeuvre of Moshekwa Langa (b. South Africa, 1975) is a study on media and technique: gouaches, collages, expansive installations, and videos. Langa avoids aesthetic harmony, denying a generalization for themes, contexts and subjects in his oeuvre. The mapping of a complex diasporic identity from his rural South African beginnings, to Johannesburg and his current situation in Northern Europe permits Langa to negotiate territorial hegemony, exploitation, identity and social mechanisms of inclusion and exclusion with a nuanced understanding of place. Gaining recognition first for his New Visual Atlas series, Langa embraces ordinary found objects––photographs, balance sheets and invoices––to rethink our familiar surroundings. While initially experimenting with text and drawing, Langa later expanded into sculptures of corrugated iron and cement bags, which stirred his investigation into alternative media.

Moshekwa Langa,"Hybridized drawing is a continued exploration in Moshekwa’s practice, integrating elements of graffiti, thread and yarn to enrich his abstract drawings of maps and space. Through the combination of ready-found materials with drawing, in the case of “Landed / Untitled XII (orange string)”, employing string, Moshekwa’s creates tension lines across the image, both physical and metaphysical to explore the traumatic events of South Africa and more specifically the passing of his grandmother. Referencing gestural painting of the 1940s and 50s, “Landed / Untitled XII (orange string)” is a disfigured and layered mapping of both the African and psychological landscape.

Mohammed Kazem,"“Untitled” was filmed in Bodh Gaya, India during a residency in 2011. There, he came across a scene that appealed to his interest in the political and social aspects of modernity. He filmed a policeman who, seemingly, is controlling traffic. Yet, when closely observed, the policeman is powerless to the overwhelming flow of vehicles and people. The policeman swings his arms and gestures as a show of control, but is unable to influence any change. The flow of traffic is random and chaotic; his perch in the middle of the road positions him on an island in a sea of humanity. This video is of the extinction of a job once important to the day-to-day of the urban environment. The man, convincing himself through his gestures that his work is of use reminds the viewer of the inconsequence’s of individuality in the face of unleashed modernity. The work is a metaphor for the life of an individual. Life passes by and we mostly leave no trace of the individual. In the tradition of absurdism central to French culture in the 1940s and 1950s, “Untitled” is a witty, poignant and thoughtful interrogation of contemporary life.","Mohammed Kazem (b. Dubai, 1969) has developed an artistic practice, encompassing video, photography and performance as a method for apprehending his varying environments and experiences. The underpinning for Kazem’s artwork is informed by his training as a musician. Exploring light and sound in tangible terms, Kazem is interested in developing processes that render transient phenomena’s. In an attempt to trace the rapid pace of modernization in the Emirates since its founding, Kazem responds to geographical location and the materiality of urban existence through positioning himself within his work as a means to assert his subjectivity. Kazem’s oeuvre is divided into two fundamental aspects, the political and the social. While his work does not follow a strict methodology of representation, Kazem’s continued assessment and assemblement of chance patterns and happenings creates meaning in the maelstrom of modernity.",Untitled,Middle East & Africa,"['gesture.n.01', 'person.n.01', 'french.a.01', 'sea.n.01', 'occupation.n.01', 'film.v.01', 'control.n.01', 'change.n.01', 'life.n.01', 'island.n.01', 'trace.n.01', 'position.n.01', 'aspect.n.01', 'metaphor.n.01', 'tradition.n.01', 'urban.a.01', 'environment.n.01', 'center.n.01', 'cardinal.s.01', 'contemporary.s.01', 'culture.n.01', 'people.n.01', 'scene.n.01', 'political.a.01', 'spectator.n.01']","['modernity.n.01', 'control.n.01', 'powerless.a.01', 'urban.a.01', 'everyday.s.01', 'struggle.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Mohammed-Kazem-Untitled-2014-Single-channel-video-colour-and-sound-1-min-and-10-sec-loop-.png,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Mohammed-Kazem-Untitled-2014-Single-channel-video-colour-and-sound-1-min-and-10-sec-loop--300x225.png,https://kadist.org/work/untitled-mohammed/,"['Politics/4.38021978021978', 'Society/2.6', 'Individual_Personal/1.6']","['Politics', 'Society', 'Individual_Personal']",8.58021978021978,"['Power/3.5802197802197804', 'Urbanization/1.0', 'Time/1.0']","['Power', 'Urbanization', 'Time']",5.58021978021978,"['Society/23.134346355398996', 'Individual_Personal/21.043496372908148', 'Material_Physical/20.674511599511604']","['Society', 'Individual_Personal', 'Material_Physical']",64.85235432781874,"['Land/7.194749694749695', 'Spirituality/6.3981684981684985', 'Urbanization/5.861538461538462']","['Land', 'Spirituality', 'Urbanization']",19.454456654456656,0.6666666666666666,0.3333333333333333
Amol Patil,"The work “Impression” refers to an Indian tradition. During a Hindu or Muslim wedding, all the inhabitants of the chawl (very modest buildings) cover their chests, arms and feet with henna. For this work the artist covered his chest with temporary henna tattoos before applying Fervicol, a synthetic resin adhesive. After waiting 24 hours for it to dry, the artist was able to peel off this “casted clothing ”, a thin film upon which the traces of this action were “printed”: wrinkles, creases and the traditional drawings.  For the artist the Fervicol symbolizes the fake nature of cosmetics. He glues to his body, consolidates, creates a new surface, a sort of sloughing that he describes as “his body’s dead skin”. We can also see it as a reference to skin whitening cream ads, which are very present in India and raise questions related to propaganda and racial bias.","Amol Patil was born in 1987 in Bombay where he lives and works.  Interested in vernacular theater and performance, Amol Patil works within family tradition: his grandfather was an interpreter and a poet (Powada Shahir, a troubadour telling epic stories as he went from one village to another); and his father was an avant-garde playwright, who addressed issues, such as the devastating effects of immigration and its traumas through absurd situations in his plays. Patil, and before him, his family, has considered art as a method of resistance. He criticizes the nihilism of youth and highlights the bad influence of big economic firms aiming at the most disfavored. He explores the desires generated by fashion and media, drawing out the imposture related to the development of malls and of Bollywood films.  Using different media, Patil’s work is constructed on a series of overlapping memories, references and protests. Certain works are related to his performances, in which he mixes almost unknown village customs, social theater and social economic comments.",Impression,Asia,"['body.n.01', 'ad.n.01', 'kind.n.01', 'print.v.01', 'trace.n.01', 'traditional.a.01', 'tradition.n.01', 'building.n.01', 'impression.n.01', 'surface.n.01', 'action.n.01', 'mention.n.01', 'nature.n.01', 'drawing.n.01', 'question.n.01', 'movie.n.01']","['skin.n.01', 'cosmetic.n.01', 'race.n.03', 'identity.n.01', 'tradition.n.01', 'surface.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Impression-site-1-1.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Impression-site-1-1-300x199.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/impression/,"['Individual_Personal/15.956954156954165', 'Cultural/12.68974358974359', 'Society/3.91025641025641']","['Individual_Personal', 'Cultural', 'Society']",32.55695415695416,"['Identity/5.7979797979797985', 'Mind/4.774358974358975', 'Media/3.9410256410256412']","['Identity', 'Mind', 'Media']",14.513364413364416,"['Cultural/33.57981652850075', 'Individual_Personal/24.604481792717095', 'Material_Physical/13.71538461538462']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Material_Physical']",71.89968293660246,"['Arts/10.309065934065934', 'Mind/8.22051282051282', 'Media/8.007264957264958']","['Arts', 'Mind', 'Media']",26.536843711843712,0.6666666666666666,0.6666666666666666
Taro Izumi,"Steak House is a video representing two small puppets smearing the artist’s face with paint while he is sleeping. The work is based on modest means and reuses the classic theme of inanimate objects coming to life during the night while humans sleep. Is this the artist’s return to repressed feelings or fatigue provoked by the task? This silent work reflects some kind of magic linked to childhood, that can be found in Japanese culture. It recalls the Yokai culture and the spirit of Japanese mangas that has existed for a thousand years, as well as Miyazaki’s animated films.","Taro Izumi was born in 1976 in Nara (Japan). He lives and works in Tokyo.  Taro Izumi combines absurd and physical experiences in his videos, creating funny and touching optical illusions. Always using raw materials and daily objects, he transports us into his burlesque and chaotic world where the videos shot in private by the artist are integrated in big installations.  His world is childlike, tinted with irony and organized by absurd game rules that he follows obstinately. So as to stress the intimate relation between the action and the place, he documents his performances with fragmented videos where images and sounds are treated like purely sensorial information. Bringing to light the absurdity of daily life, each film expresses the desperate but funny mental state of a person pushing away his boredom and desperation by continuously inventing games. Some implicit references to the events of March 11, 2011 can be observed but the artist never imposes his point of view, which remains modest, open, leaving his public free to interpret.",Steak House,Asia,"['japanese.a.01', 'culture.n.01', 'world.n.08', 'spirit.n.01', 'night.n.01', 'paint.n.01', 'house.n.01', 'establish.v.08', 'subject.n.01', 'undertaking.n.01', 'object.n.01', 'movie.n.01', 'life.n.01', 'video.n.01']","['magic.n.01', 'childhood.n.01', 'animism.n.01', 'fantasy.n.01', 'absurdity.n.01', 'sarcasm.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/taro_izumi_steak_house.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/taro_izumi_steak_house-300x223.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/steak-house/,"['Individual_Personal/17.48819562790151', 'Cultural/5.40392156862745', 'Material_Physical/2.3162393162393164']","['Individual_Personal', 'Cultural', 'Material_Physical']",25.208356512768276,"['Mind/5.773529411764706', 'Spirituality/4.847058823529412', 'Fantasy/3.756862745098039']","['Mind', 'Spirituality', 'Fantasy']",14.377450980392158,"['Individual_Personal/11.50262905309345', 'Cultural/10.958450046685341', 'Society/7.584731934731935']","['Individual_Personal', 'Cultural', 'Society']",30.045811034510727,"['Arts/5.230672268907562', 'Spirituality/4.144988344988345', 'Media/4.127777777777778']","['Arts', 'Spirituality', 'Media']",13.503438391673685,0.6666666666666666,0.3333333333333333
Little Warsaw,"Jaali – Horizontal references religious practices in Hungary that were considered as a civil disobedience throughout the 1950s. In their text associated to the work the artists state:  “My ancestors on my father’s side were rather elegant Hungarian noblemen—lots of churches, lots of religious education. My parents went to church as a form of civil resistance. Later, when it was all right to do so, they didn’t go to church because it had lost its symbolic significance; the grain of resistance in it, the spice was gone. They took me with them from the age of three. Only enemies went to church in the fifties.”  Jaali – Horizontal is a scale copy of an architectural detail of the church of Vrosmajor in Budapest designed by the architect Bertalam Arkay in the style of Bauhaus, 1932. This work is part of series that represents different types of windows in churches. Its title and form reference perforated architectural motifs characteristic of Indian and Islamic architecture and underlines the cultural interpretative tendencies of Modernist architecture and in particular, of Le Corbusier. The decorative forms are displaced in a formalist space of the modernist sculpture. A supplementary space is created, one that situates the object and the narrative under the form of a text that accompanies the artwork. Jaali – Horizontal questions slippage of truth in history.","The two Hungarian artists András Gálik (b. 1970) and Bálint Havas (b. 1971) currently based in Budapest took the name Little Warsaw in 1999 when they began developing projects together.  In their films, performances and installations, the artists examine history, multiple interpretations, collective consciousness and the reminiscent of visual language. They have a particular interest for the historical context, the perception of artworks as a dynamic process of changes in the social and political reality. A repeated strategy in deconstructing the perception of history is the displacement of monuments or objects in different contexts to undermine objective historical truths.",Jaali - Horizontal,Europe,"['architectural.a.01', 'religious.s.01', 'resistance.n.01', 'architecture.n.01', 'form.n.01', 'plan.v.03', 'motif.n.01', 'type.n.01', 'age.n.01', 'lose.v.01', 'space.n.01', 'feature.n.01', 'see.v.05', 'symbolic.a.01', 'narrative.s.01', 'artwork.n.01', 'mention.n.01', 'artist.n.01', 'manner.n.01', 'practice.n.01', 'cultural.a.01', 'question.n.01', 'title.n.01', 'make.v.03', 'sculpture.n.01']","['truth.n.01', 'history.n.01', 'modernism.n.01', 'appropriation.n.03', 'religion.n.01', 'hungary.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/LW-Jaali-Horizontal_02site.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/LW-Jaali-Horizontal_02site-300x225.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/jaali-horizontal/,"['Cultural/11.447247360482658', 'Individual_Personal/9.071794871794872', 'Material_Physical/5.217862838915471']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Material_Physical']",25.736905071193,"['Culture/4.307692307692308', 'Arts/4.0318627450980395', 'Land/3.508771929824561']","['Culture', 'Arts', 'Land']",11.84832698261491,"['Cultural/25.19571882366001', 'Society/13.355788982259574', 'Individual_Personal/11.541966530201824']","['Cultural', 'Society', 'Individual_Personal']",50.09347433612141,"['Arts/9.350594177064766', 'Culture/4.443253968253968', 'Design/4.251515151515152']","['Arts', 'Culture', 'Design']",18.045363296833884,0.6666666666666666,0.6666666666666666
Prabhakar Pachpute,"“Dark Clouds Of The Future” is a cinematographic video animation of the abandoned gold mine in Brazil, Serra Pelada (“Naked Mountain”). Thought to be one of the largest mines in the world, made famous by the photographs Alfredo Jaar and later by Sebastião Salgado, the hand-dug mine is now a mercury-polluted lake. During his research trip to Brazil, Pachpute met many former gold diggers who used to work at Serra Pelada, inciting his interest in the concept of the witness. The motif of the eye in “Dark Clouds Of The Future” is reference to witnessing and participating in the environmental destruction brought about by industrialization. The perpetual movement and transformation in Pachpute’s landscape suggests the continuous erasure of the natural environment, provoking fears and questions for the future articulated in the ominous clouds casting shadows across the mountain. The repetitiveness of the medium, the strokes of coal and pencil on paper, brought to life, as a cinemagraph is a sophisticated examination of the irreversible consequences for nature and man. “Dark Clouds Of The Future” puts into question the autonomy of the individual in the face of a global community whose actions devastate the natural environment.","Prabhakar Pachpute’s (b. Chandrapur (Maharashtra), India, 1986) choice of media — coal — is a reference to the city in which he was raised, known as The City of Black Gold. Paying tribute to his family who worked in the coalmines Pachpute’s uses coal as an interrogation of hard labour and immigration. Moving from an exploration of drawing, sculpture and shadow installations, Pachpute’s work has recently tended towards context-based interventions and in-situ drawing. Through the occupation of space with a performative presence, Pachpute attempts to unravel the complexities of the contemporary social order and identity. The same theatricality and poetry can be found in his stop motion animation films, where the drawing process is enhanced as we watch the continuously built, erased and transformed images.",Dark clouds of the future,Asia,"['future.n.01', 'dark.n.01', 'mountain.n.01', 'natural.a.01', 'environment.n.01', 'question.n.01', 'witness.n.01', 'animation.n.01', 'eye.n.01', 'motif.n.01', 'transformation.n.01', 'fear.n.01', 'destruction.n.01', 'shadow.n.01', 'global.s.01', 'celebrated.s.01', 'concept.n.01', 'community.n.01', 'person.n.01', 'paper.n.01', 'consequence.n.01', 'action.n.01', 'mention.n.01', 'nature.n.01', 'motion.n.03']","['witness.v.01', 'catastrophe.n.02', 'environment.n.01', 'mining.n.01', 'globalization.n.01', 'industrialization.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Dark-Clouds-Of-The-Future_1.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Dark-Clouds-Of-The-Future_1-300x200.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/dark-clouds-future/,"['Society/9.335930735930734', 'Material_Physical/3.4935531135531135', 'Individual_Personal/0.9230769230769231']","['Society', 'Material_Physical', 'Individual_Personal']",13.752560772560772,"['Economy/9.335930735930734', 'Environmental/2.6364102564102563', 'Familial/0.9230769230769231']","['Economy', 'Environmental', 'Familial']",12.895417915417914,"['Individual_Personal/29.31623931623933', 'Society/22.283851698173958', 'Material_Physical/21.430788819024123']","['Individual_Personal', 'Society', 'Material_Physical']",73.03087983343741,"['Emotion/10.543223443223445', 'Time/8.000996389231684', 'Violence/6.666915693002649']","['Emotion', 'Time', 'Violence']",25.211135525457777,1.0,0.0
Trevor Yeung,"“We both died at the same moment” is a humorous observation of anthropomorphism, the attribution of human emotions to nature and animals. A siliquaria armata is a slitworm that loosley-coiles a shell. Growing inside a sea-bed, a siliquaria armata will grow vertically until it touches another siliquaria armata, at which point they will knot together. Once caught by fishermen, the two worms die at the same time. Yeung undermines this romanticized phenomenon by emphasizing the emotionless in the process from the life to death of a slitworm. Yet while Yeung’s theoretical interrogation of life and death in nature and humankinds tendency to romanticize the unknown and the unknowable, “We both died at the same moment” simultaneously connotes a mythologisation of the slitworms. The vitrine, a showcase usually hosting Buddhist sculptures, common in Hong Kong, which houses the slitworm aggrandizes the phenomenon of dying at the same time of knotted siliquaria armata’s. “We both died at the same moment” puts into question the desire and tendency to romanticize nature, turning to a slitworm as a metaphor for beauty, life and death.","Trevor Yeung’s (b. 1988, Guangdong Province, China) practice, traversing a wide range of mixed media works from drawings and photographs, small objects and installations, is a delicate examination of human relations and processing. Using the human body, plants and animals as an aesthetic pretext to examine the processes of exchange and participation, Yeung projects emotional and intellectual scenarios onto biological substitutes. His allegory of the biological as the emotional interrogates the artificiality of nature and the capacity for a simulated construction of meaning. The artist creates worlds with their own logic, with his rules and that are connected to his own experiences. In doing so Yeung’s work invites his audiences to interrogate perspectives and challenge the creation of systems.

Daniel Steegmann Mangrané,"In the hologram “Mano con hojas” (”Hand with Leaves”, 2013), nature is portrayed simultaneously as an interconnected system of processes and the essence of the universe. A change in the understanding of nature challenges the understanding of our own natures. The visual metaphor of the human hand enmeshed and inextricably entangled with leaves suggests that humans cannot be divorced from nature, and moreover that they are always engaging with the problematic of overtaking nature or being overtaken by it. Each technological advance modifies our understanding of both natures, from the ancient Greek notion of physis to the current multiverse of human history.","Daniel Steegmann Mangrané was born in 1977 in Barcelona. He lives and works between Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo.  Daniel Steegmann Mangrané’s practice involves various mediums and creates subtle, poetic, but inevitably raw experiments that question the position of language in the world. Although primarily conceptual in nature, his installations engage the imagination of the spectator and display a strong concern with the existence and features of concrete objects. Steegmann Mangrané activates abstract language as a thought-generating principle that articulates unstable meanings.

Volker Eichelmann,"In his new series of collages, Eichelmann takes his starting point from the “Belvedere Torso” in the Vatican Museum. In taking over and consuming the image of the sculpture, Eichelmann deconstructs its appearance by cutting it up, covering it, rendering the sculpture an allegorical ruin. Subverting the autonomy of the ancient sculpture in art history, Eichelmann creates a palimpsest through adding a new layer to the work in deconstructing and collapsing the famous sculpture. Through the employment of pre-painted paper, the artist recreates the Hellenistic sculpture out of various recycled images. Thus, constructing a painting out of readymade marking. To avoid distance from the work, the artist prefers to work on the floor, being literally in the work.  By enlarging the image of the sculpture, he renders illegible, changing the meaning of the work to become a distant and banal disfigurement of that which the occidental art historical canon touts as high art. “The Belvedere Torso” is employed as a sophisticated reference to the issues surrounding the continued use of historically famous artworks in contemporary society. In “Torso of the Belvedere II”, Eichelmann forms new meaning to the work through a metaphysical restoration.","Volker Eichelmann (b. Hamburg, Germany, 1973) lives and works in London. Working across various media including video, painting, photography, Eichelmann has recently started experimenting with collage. Eichelmann practice seeks out the forgotten and over looked techniques of the past to consider a contemporary critique of artistic precedence. His series of text-paintings combine drawing, painting and collaged text to present autobiographical exclamations gathered from their original context and transformed into poetic evocations of distant environments, contexts and encounters. Eichelmann recent works are play with the ideas of construction and deconstruction through his technique. His explorations of collage, a medium central to the early twentieth century, is an innovative deconstruction of the canon of art history.",Torso of the Belvedere V,Europe,"['sculpture.n.01', 'celebrated.s.01', 'meaning.n.01', 'ancient.s.01', 'distance.n.01', 'appearance.n.01', 'image.n.01', 'floor.n.01', 'layer.n.01', 'issue.n.01', 'collage.n.01', 'museum.n.01', 'artwork.n.01', 'paper.n.01', 'society.n.01', 'historical.a.01', 'mention.n.01', 'contemporary.s.01', 'history.n.01', 'series.n.01']","['art_history.n.01', 'metaphysics.n.01', 'restoration.n.01', 'reinterpretation.n.01', 'deconstruct.v.01', 'palimpsest.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/1-Torso-of-the-Belvedere-II.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/1-Torso-of-the-Belvedere-II-218x300.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/torso-of-the-belvedere/,"['Cultural/16.709120841318985', 'Individual_Personal/5.9561403508771935', 'Society/5.042898913951546']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Society']",27.708160106147723,"['Arts/10.129480564155486', 'History/5.042898913951546', 'Mind/3.414035087719298']","['Arts', 'History', 'Mind']",18.58641456582633,"['Cultural/26.773671100141694', 'Individual_Personal/16.65382687487951', 'Material_Physical/9.887234987234987']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Material_Physical']",53.31473296225619,"['Arts/8.247389048859636', 'Culture/7.354700854700855', 'Mind/7.169963369963369']","['Arts', 'Culture', 'Mind']",22.77205327352386,0.6666666666666666,0.6666666666666666

Kennedy Browne,"Milton Friedman on the wonder of the free market pencil is an installation based on 42 blank pages. On the first page, one can read the original version in English of the liberal speech by Milton Friedman on “The Story of the pencil”. On the other pages, the same text has been translated into 41 different languages by using Google Translate, before coming back to English. It is significant that Dublin, the artists’ home town, is also a centre for IT industries and the site of Google’s European offices. The final page becomes much shorter than the original text and it has been transformed into something raher incomprehensible. This work has not only an evident political and social dimension but also a poetic one: how a linguistic journey produces a loss of information but also leads to new interpretations. Kennedy Browne represented Ireland during the Venice Biennial in 2009, where this work was on view.","Kennedy Browne’s practice concerns itself with ways of temporarily occupying particular architectural fragments and cultural texts.

Clemens von Wedemeyer,"Silberhöhe, directed at Halle, located in the former GDR (German Democratic Republic), is the name of a neighborhood on the outskirts of the city, which was built in the 70’s and could accommodate more 40,000 people. The opening of the film presents us with a dramatic process that transforms the documentary image. The lack of human presence makes creates a strange atmosphere in the film. A street lit by streetlights pays homage to the film “The Eclipse” by Antonioni, of which we can also see an of the end of television in an empty apartment. Time is also treated by Von Wedermeyer as a transition from night to day, from darkness to light. In the second part of the film the abandoned buildings are seen more clearly, more or less demolished. Buildings being demolished not only speak of a crisis, but they also reflect a process of change during a modernist utopias’ dissipation. There has been consideration of the failure of older systems, and changes of political regimes.","Clemens Von Wedemeyer is certainly one of the artists of his generation that make intelligible our relationship to reality through the use of different transmissions of images, whether through film or video. The artist employs the documentary genre as a method in his analysis of reality. However, his use of fiction gives us the opportunity to examine different images.

Clemens von Wedemeyer,"Die Siedlung is a filmic documentary about the recent shift in housing developments in Leipzig-Grünau in former East Germany and its consequences on some inhabitants. It complements von Wedemeyer slightly earlier and more artistic film Silberhöhe (2003) which decried imposed Modernist living model. In Die Siedlung, a voiceover describes and criticizes the different sites on view while the camera moves slowly past a vast abandoned 1930s Nazi army barracks which has yet to be converted or demolished, the building site and wastelands for the new private single family housing area, a constructed pond and finally the 1960s or 70s communal blocks of flats. An estate agent is recorded introducing the newer building site and its future plans in rather deadpan and unconvincing terms, according to him the Bauhaus concept has met resistance from the majority of buyers. A cynical jobseeker expresses his disgust faced with the notion of private property in an interview. The short piece quietly but efficiently denounces the blind pressures of “social reconditioning”. Von Wedemeyer’s work borrows from cinematic or documentary conventions (alike or separately) to analyze architecture as well as urban planning and their impact on behavior with great acuity.","Clemens Von Wedemeyer is certainly one of the artists of his generation that make intelligible our relationship to reality through the use of different transmissions of images, whether through film or video. The artist employs the documentary genre as a method in his analysis of reality. However, his use of fiction gives us the opportunity to examine different images. Referencing the work of Antonioni with “Silberhöhe”, he puts us in a genealogy of directors who have also questioned the complex relationship between fiction and reality.

Toby Ziegler,"The Fifth Quarter might have taken its mysterious inspiration from the eponymous Stephen King story collated into the Nightmares & Dreamscapes collection. Various vanishing points and interior perspectives, like in another painting dated the same year called Continental Breakfast, create a complex matrix in which motifs, shadowy or geometric forms coexist to further confuse the map of this space. A disturbing yet alluring virtual reality composed of a medley of seemingly abstract designs is depicted through digital and painterly means. Architectural and landscape paintings in reflective metallic paints are characteristic of Ziegler’s work shown at the time in Archipeinture at Le Plateau, Paris and Camden Arts Centre, London in (2006) and in his solo show Enter Desire at Chisenhale Gallery, London (2005). He was then known for using an industrial phosphorescent material called Scotchlight for its contemporary glow in order to blur distinctions between reality and representation.","Toby Ziegler is a British artist whose work first came to view in an exhibition called Expander in 2004. His paintings are based on photographs that he digitally manipulates to render them more abstract. His sculptures are closer to being figures and it is in a figurative direction that his painting is now going. These sculptures, therefore, are important transitional works. Most of Ziegler’s sculptures are made out of cardboard or paper and covered in numerals which he employs to piece them together. Like the paintings, the sculptures emanate from digital images. He uses computer-aided design to generate line drawings and then, with scissors and glue, pieces them together. The forms of his sculptures have a relationship to Cubism, whose spatial complexity Ziegler admires, and perhaps also De Kooning for their sexual overtones. The numerals make oblique reference to his father’s mania for indexing and cataloguing but are also used in scaling up the works.Toby Ziegelr was born in 1972 in London.

Toby Ziegler,"Wagon Wheel is a work with a fundamental dynamism that derives both from the rotating movement of the elements suspended on poles and the kicking of the legs of the figure. It is based on a pornographic image by Giulio Romano (ca.1499-1546). Romano had completed Raphael’s frescos in the Vatican after the latter’s death but was not paid for the work. Ziegler relates how in revenge Romano drew pornographic images on the buildings of the Vatican. The Pope erased them but Marcantonio Raimondi (ca. 1480-1534) turned the images into prints, a series called « I Modi », which were widely circulated in Rome and for which he was jailed. The Pope, realising they brought him into disrepute, gathered them all together and destroyed them. Other artists had copied them, however, and such copies exist in the British Museum.  Wagon Wheel is the first sculpture of the figure that Ziegler made. He has since moved into figurative painting but he states that he could not have done this without making sculpture first. He believes this particular work is crucial to that development. It was inspired not only by the Romano prints, but also by seeing a sculpture of hands by Rodin. He feels that most of Rodin’s sculptures are too complete for him to be able to work off them. But the sculpture of a hand fired his imagination because of its incompleteness.  Wagon Wheel also relates to the sculpture of Ancient Greece which is frequently displayed as a compilation of fragments, with armatures supporting disparate parts and acting as surrogate limbs or body parts.","Toby Ziegler is a British artist whose work first came to view in an exhibition called Expander in 2004.

Bruno Pacheco,"En Guard Souvenir is composed of a group of eleven elements (ten paintings on paper and a sculpture) which deconstructs and recomposes the context of Tienanmen Square in Beijing. This square is known for numerous political events : the cultural revolution between 1966 and 1976, the arrest of the Gang of Four and protests in 1989 where thousands of demonstrators who were protesting against the corruption of the regime were killed. In this work, Bruno Pacheco alludes to the historical importance of this place, the choice of viewpoints reveals very precise but sporadic details there : part of the mausoleum devoted to Mao, a portrait of him and its frame, a view overlooking the Forbidden City, etc. On the square, two guards stand on their platform, facing each other, executing their rituals. The installation leads one to think about various angles of approach within a historical discontinuity.  With a certain spontaneity, Bruno Pacheco crystallizes the gestures of the characters (guards) in his paintings. The different viewpoints are organized in order to construct a rhythmic visual narration. The sculpture is to be perceived at the centre point of the installation, it is the platform also found in the paintings though this one is empty, figuring the absence for the guard and require the public’s projection in order to understand the participation of this object within the installation. The artist’s cinematographic approach places an emphasis on form, frame and color in order to open a dialogue about the deconstruction of this site through this sequential and fragmentary mode. The worrying distance which is created develops a distinct form which alludes to the unfathomable chasm between memory and reality, private and public space. This work reveals the artist’s political commitment and his interrogation regarding the individual within the collective.","Painting is at the center of the artist Bruno Pacheco’s practice.

Taysir Batniji,"Fathers #18 and Fathers #27  is part of a series of photographs and videos made in recent years in Gaza. Batniji addresses the representation of the over-identified human and physical space with the geographical and political situation in the region. He distinguishes himself from the fictions that have been previously created in the Middle East and offers a quieter and more retained vision of the of the intertwining tensions and oppositions in this area.  Fathers offers an incomplete inventory of portraits that we often see framed and hanging on the walls of cafes, stalls, shops, workshops and other workplaces in Gaza and the Middle East. Often old and yellowed, sometimes dusty and slanted, these portraits rarely have links to the current owner and they relate instead to the person who founded the place and who left long ago. Since these places are overloaded with symbols and signs of presence (s) and disorder (s) but devoid of human inhabitants, or their owners, they become a particular paradigm of some sort of “still life”. This kind of places seem full (of products, objects, memories and signs of life) and empty at the same time. By overlooking different temporalities, memory and regards, or by being petrified, like ruins after a disaster that nobody will ever know,  they belong to the present and to the past. The power of these images lies in what they hold as much as in what they reveal.",Taysir Batniji was born in Gaza in 1966.

Jiri Kovanda,"This ephemeral installation by Jirí Kovanda, documented in the same way as his performances with a photograph and a text, belongs to a body of works that took place in his apartment/studio. During an interview with Hans Ulrich Obrist, the artist highlighted that he had never had a studio and that this work space blended with his apartment. A piece of string cuts across the room in a diagonal; it functions as a scale to measure time and space. This element recurs in the artist’s work: during the summer 1979, the artist pulled a string across riverbanks. This work makes present – through coexistence and contrast – the geometry and abstraction of this line with daily objects. The string modifies the space in a minimal way since it can no longer be perceived as a unit due to this diagonal. “At the time, I was reading a lot about zen. Even the most ordinary thing can become extraordinary with a small shift in context. And the simpler the shift, the better. It is just about perturbing a stereotype and intensifying a sensation, life”, said the artist in an interview with Guillaume Leingre (Particules, issue 18). This string could function like a haïku, the very short Japanese poems that aim to capture the evanescence of things: perhaps he is materializing a spider’s web, a ray of sunshine, the link between two ideas…  All Kovanda’s artistic practice poses the question of visibility. Having worked on actions and performance, the artist decided to ‘disappear’ from his artworks during twenty years; in 2007, his performance Kissing through glass in the institutional setting of Tate Modern was acclaimed by critics. Some works are only visible thirty years later via traces and archives; the artist’s rehabilitation by institutions and galleries offers a new critical reading of his practice which had until then remained rather confidential. What is particularly noted are his links with the history of gesture since the 1970s.  Jirí Kovanda’s works have in common a great economy of means. The artist assures that we need “get along with what we have”, which in his case meant gestures, objects, and non-artistic materials, used in interventions or installations. The artworks are incredibly slight and come together in a fragile equilibrium: brushing against passers-by in the street (1977), making a branch hold on two chewing-gums (2008).

Jiri Kovanda,"All Kovanda’s artistic practice poses the question of visibility. Having worked on actions and performance, the artist decided to ‘disappear’ from his artworks during twenty years; in 2007, his performance Kissing through glass in the institutional setting of Tate Modern was acclaimed by critics. Some works are only visible thirty years later via traces and archives; the artist’s rehabilitation by institutions and galleries offers a new critical reading of his practice which had until then remained rather confidential. What is particularly noted are his links with the history of gesture since the 1970s.  Jirí Kovanda’s works have in common a great economy of means. The artist assures that we need “get along with what we have”, which in his case meant gestures, objects, and non-artistic materials, used in interventions or installations. The artworks are incredibly slight and come together in a fragile equilibrium: brushing against passers-by in the street (1977), making a branch hold on two chewing-gums (2008). His actions – theatre with no spectator ? – question the threshold of visibility, until they become ‘absurd’ (in the etymological sense of what cannot be heard). The artist ignites thinking about the other and about form, two ideas that connect the work.  Kovanda’s ‘discreet’ actions (leaving a discussion in a rush, bumping into passers-by in the street, making a pile of rubbish and scattering it, looking at the sun until tears come…) are always documented according to the same format: a piece of A4 paper, a concise typewritten text, and sometimes a photograph taken by someone else.  In this action, the artist arrives for a rendez-vous 10 minutes early and positions himself to wait alone until his friends join him. Jirí Kovanda introduces slight disjunctions with the social use of time and this action plays with the notion of not arriving late. This work has resonance with a missed rendez-vous, one of the artist’s last actions. On 23 January 1978, the artist did not appear for a rendez-vous he had made with friends on a square in Prague, ‘disappearing’ from his works until 2000.  A complex relation comes to be between the action, its documentation, and its audience, posing the question of their meaning. His works have been exhibited some thirty years after they took place for a ‘second audience’. “I think that the message was sending out was not intended for the people who were present when the actions happened at the concrete moment they were taking place. The message was intended more for those who would read about them as actions. What I was interested in was something ordinary, something normal, that might happen that way. That’s what they were all about. For me, they don’t have any symbolic meaning”, according to the artist.","Jiri Kovanda was born in 1953 in Prague, Czech Republic.

Milena Bonilla,"Milena Bonilla’s discursive practice explores connections among economics, territory, and politics through everyday interventions. Her drawings, sculptures, and photography are active investigations into our often-fallible notions of history. Stone Deaf (2009) is a direct intervention into Karl Marx’s gravesite, for which the artist literally traced the history of Marx’s grave. She traveled to Highgate in London seeking the gravesite, only to find a plaque stating that Marx’s remains had been removed in 1954 to another part of the cemetery. She discovered that this had taken place at the behest of the British Communist Party, and that the deceased was now in a more prominent location, marked with a bust and a monument. Bonilla’s rubbing of the original plaque celebrates an anti-monument, so to speak, calling into question Marx’s life and legacy.","Milena Bonilla’s discursive practice explores connections among economics, territory, transit, and politics through everyday interventions. Her drawings, sculptures, installations, videos, texts, public interventions, and photographs are active investigations into our often-fallible notions of history. The artist’s current practice involves explorations of knowledge interpreted as a work force, and of nature as an entity colonized by language, consumed on a massive scale through images. For the last decade or so, Bonilla’s work has specifically explored the dichotomy of the Aristotelian categories of physis (nature) and logos (reason).

Wong Hoy Cheong,"Re: Looking marks a new phase in Wong’s work which connects his region’s history with other parts of the world. The video—located in an imagined contemporary Malaysian middle-class living room, a space of a fictive former imperial power—explores the precarious link between fact and fiction, fakery and authenticity by overlaying three believable, authoritative forms: a documentary, a website, and a realistic reconstruction of a contemporary home. It is rife with occidental colonial documents and exotic cultural artifacts—the trophy-evidence of Empire-making. The video parodies television networks and documentaries as researched authoritative forms of information. It begins by posing as a serious, believable work of non-fiction, but becomes increasingly unsettling with its inclusion of fictive events, memories, and histories around the urgent contemporary problems of migration, racism, power relationships, and empire making.","Born in Malaysia, Wong Hoy Cheong’s work examines the formation of his country’s multicultural identity vis-à-vis global migration, trade, colonialism, and the postcolonial circulation of people, ideas, and capital. His extended body of work uses various media—drawing, painting, performance, installation, video, and on-line projects—to critique the impact of these developments on contemporary life within and without South Asia.

Zhou Tao,"For over five months, Zhou situated himself in an underdeveloped village surrounded by the high skyscrapers of Guangzhou to produce South Stone. Interweaving footage of a village’s landscape, residents, and animals with his seemingly absurd interventions with the place, South Stone indicates the equally incoherent social reality. Fluctuating between documentary and fiction, the film catalyzes alternative connections in time, and the emergence of imaginative spaces. Zhou’s practice alchemizes the ordinary surroundings into a theatre where he superimposes and interchanges the background and the stage, the viewer and the actor, the fact and the story line, the documentation and the representation. His camera is not simply a recording apparatus but an extension of existence, which requires active participation. The images it produces are not just detached spectacles: They are the agents that reveal the theatrical details suffused in mundane life.","There is no single entry to the practice of Zhou Tao, who combines video with photographs, drawings and built environments to challenge our perception of any singular or real narrative or space. Through subtle and humorous interactions with people, objects, and environments, and through an intuitive editing process that creates a montage of scenes from various locations to appear as one, Zhou Tao’s videos invite us to experience the multiple trajectories of reality—what he calls the “folding scenario” or the “zone with folds.” The spaces he depicts are often transitional or in between: edges of roads, a concrete underpass beneath a bridge, overgrown plants in forgotten areas inside cities are often the protagonists. Also focusing on the communities that inhabit these spaces, his work lacks narrative but is instead rooted in the gaze of his lens, moving around nature, urban scapes and their dwellers, almost as a form of documentary.

Zhou Tao,"Created for the Seventh Shanghai Biennale at the Shanghai Art Museum, Zhou Tao’s 1,2,3,4 records morning staff meetings in over forty shops and companies in the immediate vicinity of the People’s Square. Regardless of occupation, the employees count off and move in step to the rhythms of their companies’ corporate songs or chants, which are meant to build team spirit and corporate loyalty. Zhou’s practice alchemizes the ordinary surroundings into a theatre where his camera is not simply a recording apparatus but an extension of existence. The images it produces are not just detached spectacles: They are the agents that reveal the theatrical details suffused in mundane life.","There is no single entry to the practice of Zhou Tao, who combines video with photographs, drawings and built environments to challenge our perception of any singular or real narrative or space. Through subtle and humorous interactions with people, objects, and environments, and through an intuitive editing process that creates a montage of scenes from various locations to appear as one, Zhou Tao’s videos invite us to experience the multiple trajectories of reality—what he calls the “folding scenario” or the “zone with folds.” The spaces he depicts are often transitional or in between: edges of roads, a concrete underpass beneath a bridge, overgrown plants in forgotten areas inside cities are often the protagonists. Also focusing on the communities that inhabit these spaces, his work lacks narrative but is instead rooted in the gaze of his lens, moving around nature, urban scapes and their dwellers, almost as a form of documentary. For him, the use of video is not a deliberate choice of artistic language or medium, instead the operation of the camera is a way of being that blends itself with everyday life. As the artist describes it he is influenced by a consciousness in performance which is then viewed through the moving image: “my relationship with reality and with the filmed image.” In his thoughtful and speculative approach his camera is not simply a recording apparatus but an extension of his existence and his active participation in the environments.

Koki Tanaka,"Tanaka’s unique understanding of objects and materials is reflected in the four photographs that document his Process of Blowing Flour. The images depict the gradual blowing away of a plate of flour held by Tanaka. Because his pose is static throughout the images, his presence is deemphasized and instead the viewer’s attention is drawn to the motion of the flour. The subtle contrast between the fixed and the flowing generates a sense of time and ephemerality, suggesting the infinite possibilities of chance to alter our inflexible perceptions. The aesthetic quality of the flowing flour also evidences the ability of the simplest gesture to generate spectacle.","Koki Tanaka is part of a generation of Japanese artists whose work responded to the economic recession and limited opportunities that beset their country in the early 2000s. Instead of creating monuments, these artists focused on everyday life, transforming the ordinary into the extraordinary by stimulating moments of perceptual awakening.

Fully computer-generated, the riot sequence that splits the film in two parts operates a reversal of history by transforming a revolt against the algorithm into an algorithm of revolt.","Fabien Giraud (born in 1980) and Raphael Siboni (born in 1981) live and work in Paris, France","1834 – La Mémoire de Masse (""The Unmanned"" series)",Europe,"['episode.n.01', 'history.n.01', 'mass.n.01', 'worker.n.01', 'form.n.03', 'sequence.n.01', 'complex.a.01', 'modern.a.01', 'century.n.01', 'event.n.01', 'historical.a.01', 'motion.n.03', 'movie.n.01']","['industry.n.01', 'technology.n.01', 'machine.n.01', 'computer.n.01', 'rebellion.n.02', 'riot.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/1834_LMDM_HEVC.00_00_00_00.Still001.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/1834_LMDM_HEVC.00_00_00_00.Still001-300x169.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/1834-la-memoire-de-masse-the-unmanned-series/,"['Cultural/15.891339869281047', 'Society/6.239705882352942', 'Politics/4.631862745098039']","['Cultural', 'Society', 'Politics']",26.76290849673203,"['Technology/10.912254901960784', 'Violence/2.705065359477124', 'War/2.534640522875817']","['Technology', 'Violence', 'War']",16.151960784313722,"['Material_Physical/13.422766122766122', 'Cultural/9.408450046685342', 'Society/8.261990950226243']","['Material_Physical', 'Cultural', 'Society']",31.093207119677707,"['Time/6.7116550116550115', 'Body/3.371794871794872', 'Media/3.327777777777778']","['Time', 'Body', 'Media']",13.411227661227661,0.6666666666666666,0.0

Alejandro Marré,"Typical Weapons is a series of sculptural interventions where Alejandro Marre transforms traditional Guatemalan craft objects usually sold as souvenirs into weapons. Wooden flutes, hacky sacks, and musical instruments are woven with rope to appear as nunchucks, slingshots, and other forms of armament. Designed to be exhibited as objects from an archaeological museum, the previously innocuous representations of Guatemalan popular culture acquire darker meanings as they come to symbolize the brutality and extreme violence that now mark the country. Representing Guatemala just as much as the souvenirs they are made of, Typical Weapons are icons of a culture in which violence and disrespect for human life have become deeply rooted.","Alejandro Marre belongs to a generation of artists who transformed the Guatemalan artistic scene immediately after a devastating Civil War that lasted over 36 years. A seminal work by Marre is a performance that took place in the year 2000 during the festival Octubre Azul in which the artist married a cow as his alter ego Doctor Virus, a character he assumed to expose macho, toxic masculinity and gender inequality in the institution of marriage. Other works by the artist also take their cue from tradition, misusing it as a means to address complex themes. On a series of traditional Guatemalan paintings, Marre overlaid motifs from popular Western television characters such as Barney the Dinosaur and Teletubbies as an analogy for the impact and cultural dominance that first world countries have in the third world. He has also subverted other ‘artesanias’ — craft objects which are the product of communitary cultural identity — to speak of the conflict and violence that has gripped his country for decades.",Typical Weapons,Americas,"['violence.n.01', 'culture.n.01', 'object.n.01', 'icon.n.01', 'plan.v.03', 'sculptural.a.01', 'intervention.n.01', 'popular.a.01', 'traditional.a.01', 'museum.n.01', 'state.n.04', 'representation.n.01', 'meaning.n.01', 'human.a.01', 'life.n.01', 'form.n.01', 'series.n.01']","['violence.n.01', 'weapon.n.01', 'identity.n.02', 'craft.v.01', 'civil_war.n.01', 'transform.v.02']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Typical-Weapon-No8-copy.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Typical-Weapon-No8-copy-300x200.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/typical-weapons/,"['Society/7.1307189542483655', 'Cultural/3.980392156862745', 'Politics/2.541176470588235']","['Society', 'Cultural', 'Politics']",13.652287581699346,"['Technology/3.980392156862745', 'War/3.5882352941176467', 'Violence/3.542483660130719']","['Technology', 'War', 'Violence']",11.11111111111111,"['Individual_Personal/15.30256410256411', 'Material_Physical/8.082051282051282', 'Cultural/7.695604395604396']","['Individual_Personal', 'Material_Physical', 'Cultural']",31.08021978021979,"['Mind/4.9282051282051285', 'Materiality/4.3589743589743595', 'Culture/4.26923076923077']","['Mind', 'Materiality', 'Culture']",13.556410256410258,0.3333333333333333,0.0
Lala Rašcic,"In Greek mythology, Arachne was a talented mortal weaver who challenged Athena, goddess of wisdom and crafts, to a weaving contest; this hubris resulted in her being transformed into a spider. EE-0 is the first episode of the Europa Enterprise project which looks into new, feminist readings of established Eurocentric myths and reconsiders the meaning of cultural heritage and the production of artifacts for the future. In EE-0, the Greek myth of Arachne is re-contextualized through a poetic script, taking an imaginative leap from antiquity into science fiction. Skewed and subverted storylines from classic mythology are combined with anecdotal episodes found through field research in and around Prizren, Kosovo. Ideas of repressed ancient female knowledge and power are probed through storying of local urban myths, customs, and current sociological, ecological and cultural phenomena, in what the artist calls “an homage to millennia-old resistance to patriarchy… [giving a]voice to transform the European roots of toxic social representations and punishments exercised on women.”  The performer carries the video; she is seen enacting text in a theatrical setting during which we witness her gradual transformation into the spider-character of Arachne. Reacting to the specific site of production in Kosovo, Europe’s youngest nation-state, the idea of becoming is explored through the idea of genesis, transformation, and metamorphosis.  Europa Enterprise-0 was commissioned by KADIST and Lumbardhi Foundation (Kosovo) as part of the three-year project “Not Fully Human, Not Human at All” curated by Nataša Petrešin-Bachelez.","Lala Rašcic lives and works between Zagreb, Sarajevo and New Orleans. Her projects take the shape of videos, artifacts, installations, drawings and performances and her interests are rooted in the different modes of performing text. This interest is extended from a fascination for ancient and contemporary storytelling practices, oral histories, and the art of the monodrama. Her work draws upon the aesthetics of old radio plays where the performative act is the basis of assuming different identities, the artist often acting out multiple roles while playing with different temporalities and realities.  She is also the president of the board of the collective Crvena from Sarajevo, comprising artists, producers and theoreticians who work on art, culture, feminism, education, ecology, gender equality, human rights and civil society in Bosnia and in the former republics of Yugoslavia.",Europa Enterprise-0  (EE-0),Europe,"['episode.n.01', 'transform.v.01', 'transformation.n.01', 'idea.n.01', 'production.n.01', 'undertaking.n.01', 'cultural.a.01', 'artifact.n.01', 'reading.n.01', 'cognition.n.01', 'phenomenon.n.01', 'field.n.01', 'europe.n.01', 'setting.n.01', 'research.v.02', 'ancient.s.01', 'current.a.01', 'specific.a.01', 'resistance.n.01', 'local.a.01', 'voice.n.01', 'poetic.a.01', 'future.n.01', 'fiction.n.01', 'urban.a.01']","['mythology.n.01', 'feminism.n.01', 'culture.n.01', 'artifact.n.01', 'resistance.n.01', 'patriarchy.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/EE-0_2018_video_still-_04.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/EE-0_2018_video_still-_04-300x169.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/europa-enterprise-0-ee-0/,"['Cultural/21.497175373645973', 'Individual_Personal/8.924903038138332', 'Society/7.72074592074592']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Society']",38.142824332530225,"['Arts/7.96037296037296', 'Design/4.092760180995475', 'Technology/3.876923076923077']","['Arts', 'Design', 'Technology']",15.930056218291512,"['Cultural/47.356923631923614', 'Individual_Personal/29.73883908489173', 'Society/19.01445792769323']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Society']",96.11022064450857,"['Culture/11.346153846153848', 'Arts/11.125208125208125', 'Mind/11.085470085470087']","['Culture', 'Arts', 'Mind']",33.55683205683206,1.0,0.3333333333333333
Matt Mullican,"Mullican’s Stick Figure Drawings depict characters reduced to their most basic graphic representation. Glen is a simple silhouette, genderless and inspired by a found photo of a crime scene, in whom we recognize the generic sign of the universal symbol of a self-portrait.  Mullican continually projects himself, sometimes physically, into the silhouette that he has created, allowing the artist to pass from one reality to another. Most recently Glen can be found in the project Representing the work, which comprises a collection of collages, drawings and drapes all of which feature his most iconic characters. Again, the artist brings us into a space of presentation and representation, questioning the difference between the work, and the representation of the work. The large white sheets also function as objects, allowing for imagined projections. Given the centrality of performance in his work, we might also read such elements as a reference to both the unconscious and the body.","Since the 1970s Matt Mullican has been developing an encyclopedic practice that borders on the obsessive. Working within the conceptual art tradition, the Californian artist seeks to work within the parameters of systems in order to better overcome traditional frameworks. From reality and fiction, subject and object, consciousness and unconscious, his work oscillates between different antagonisms in order to develop a notion of perception through a cosmology based on the symbolism of representation, creating a multiplicity of signs, including photographs, pictograms and schemas. His research into consciousness has also led the artist to investigate the possibilities of hypnosis as way of reaching beyond representation and introducing chaos to order. These trances gave way the appearance of That Person, the artist’s alter ego, first presented in New York in 1982,through whom he explores the borders of reality and representation.",Untitled (Details from fictional realities),Americas,"['representation.n.01', 'fictional_character.n.01', 'drawing.n.01', 'undertaking.n.01', 'presentation.n.01', 'sheet.n.01', 'read.v.01', 'projection.n.01', 'iconic.a.01', 'sign.n.01', 'symbol.n.01', 'collage.n.01', 'simple.a.01', 'inspire.v.01', 'elements.n.01', 'mention.n.01', 'white.a.01', 'performance.n.01', 'world.n.03', 'figure.n.01', 'make.v.03', 'scene.n.01', 'body.n.01', 'object.n.01', 'space.n.01']","['body.n.01', 'world.n.03', 'fiction.n.01', 'object.n.01', 'cosmology.n.01', 'symbolism.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Capture-d’écran-2019-10-20-à-18.21.24.png,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Capture-d’écran-2019-10-20-à-18.21.24-300x200.png,https://kadist.org/work/untitled-details-from-fictional-realities/,"['Cultural/16.423149219201854', 'Material_Physical/8.884615384615385', 'Individual_Personal/6.027747252747252']","['Cultural', 'Material_Physical', 'Individual_Personal']",31.335511856564494,"['Space/6.346153846153846', 'Arts/6.22818584923848', 'Fantasy/5.491666666666667']","['Space', 'Arts', 'Fantasy']",18.066006362058992,"['Individual_Personal/23.541856148667303', 'Cultural/22.29852402499462', 'Material_Physical/17.417074738127376']","['Individual_Personal', 'Cultural', 'Material_Physical']",63.2574549117893,"['Space/9.791433712486345', 'Mind/8.937254901960785', 'Culture/7.176923076923077']","['Space', 'Mind', 'Culture']",25.905611691370208,1.0,0.3333333333333333
Randa Maddah,"A woman meticulously tidies up the room of a ruined house in the village of Ain Fit in the occupied Syrian Golan. The village was destroyed by the Israeli forces in 1967, as was the case for many other villages. Inhabitants were prevented from returning to their homes, fleeing to Syria’s refugee camps, separated from the rest of their families. Randa Maddah was born in one of the few remaining villages, Majdal Shams, located on the cease-fire line from where she was able to contemplate the inaccessible ‘other side’. A fixed camera films the artist doing housework in a ruined house, refurbishing it with floating curtains, a table, a chair and a strange object that looks like a bomb. After she finishes her work, the artist sits and contemplates the horizon towards Syria where, at that time, Syrian refugees from Golan were suffering the hardships of war. The video performance connects the exiled from both sides of the border, through the empathic process of creating a mirror image where everyday life resists oblivion. By creating familiarity in the midst of tragedy and destruction, by maintaining the property of the uprooted, by ritualizing their lost lives, the work calls for their return.","Randa Maddah, was born 1983 in Majdal Shams, occupied Syrian Golan. Her practice is often rooted in the notion of homeland, working closely around the subject of Madjal Shams and the inextricable ties to war, homeland, borders and exile. With formal training in sculpture and etching, Maddah’s work frequently takes the form of realistic depictions of bodies and landscapes, warped by weight of experience, the faces and forms of which are mirrored in her pencil drawings.

Cristóbal Lehyt,"Untitled is part of a series of works based on drawings Cristobál Lehyt made, inspired by the discovery of ancient mummies in the desert of Atacama, as well as mummified bodies found in mass graves from the time period of Pinochet’s dictatorship in Chile. The drawings, like a memory process, are then transposed onto different surfaces–walls, painting, Plexiglas sheets–in order to create different layers and reflect the different political stratums bound up in archeological findings.","Cristobál Lehyt’s work exposes the cultural gap that might separate one cultural scene from another and the potential misunderstandings this might provoke.

Jane Jin Kaisen and Guston Sondin-Kung,"The Woman, The Orphan, and The Tiger begins with the sound of women’s voices describing histories of violence, of things repressed and silenced. Gradually, their voices accumulate into a cacophony of pure sonic intensity against an extreme slow-motioned image of a woman survivor of Japan’s military sexual slavery who, in the absence of words to accurately account for her suffering, gets up and walks into the center of a war crimes tribunal court room and gestures wildly before she faints. This work by Jane Jin Kasen and Guston Sondin-Kung explores ways in which trauma is passed on from previous generations to the present through a sense of being haunted. Following a group of international adoptees and other women of the Korean diaspora in their 20s and 30s, the film uncovers how the return of the repressed confronts and destabilizes narratives that have been constructed to silence histories of pain and violence inflicted onto the bodies and lives of women and children.  A genealogy is created by relating the stories of three generations of women: the former ‘comfort’ women who were subjected to military sexual slavery by the Japanese military between World War I and World War II – women who have worked as sex-workers around US military bases in South Korea since the 1950s to the present – and transnational adopted women from South Korea to the West since the Korean War. Composed of oral testimonies, poetry, public statements and interview fragments, the filmic narrative unfolds in a non-chronologic and layered manner. By reinterpreting and juxtaposing historical archive footage with recorded documentary material and staged performative actions, multiple spaces and times are conjoined to contour how a nexus of militarism, patriarchy, racism and nationalism served to suppress and marginalize certain parts of the population and how this aspect of world history continues to reverberate in the present moment.","Working with narrative experimental film, multi-channel video installation, performative video art, photography, and text, Jane Jin Kaisen engages themes of memory, trauma, migration and translation at the intersection of personal and collective histories. Her own diasporic story, sent from Jeju island, South Korea to Denmark as an adoptee brought her to think critically about women’s diaspora as a dark shadow of East Asia’s history of modernization. Kaisen’s practice is propelled by a sense of necessity and an aspiration for carving out spaces for critical reflection and dialogue. She creates distinct modes of storytelling through layered narratives and experimental usage of voice, image, sound, and archive material. Her artworks resonate as both critical translations and poetic testimonies, gesturing towards emerging communities and embodied memories that linger ghostly at the margins of the seeable and sayable. While each work is driven by its own aesthetic and discursive commitments, together they form a multi-faceted and in-depth inquiry into transnational and gendered histories related to legacies of colonialism, modernity, war, and borders.  Guston Sondin-Kung is an American visual artist that lives in Denmark. His artistic practice is situated primarily in the field of narrative experimental cinema and is oftentimes project-based, with a lengthy research component. Recurring themes in his artwork include notions of embodied performance and multi-directional memory.","The Woman, The Orphan, and The Tiger",Asia,"['woman.n.01', 'military.a.01', 'war.n.01', 'coevals.n.01', 'voice.n.01', 'south.n.01', 'violence.n.01', 'history.n.01', 'narrative.n.01', 'west.n.01', 'statement.n.01', 'interview.n.01', 'population.n.01', 'japan.n.01', 'injury.n.01', 'times.n.01', 'fragment.n.01', 'documentary.a.01', 'multiple.a.01', 'japanese.a.01', 'footage.n.01', 'aspect.n.01', 'compose.v.01', 'child.n.01', 'narrative.s.01']","['maltreatment.n.01', 'war.n.01', 'army.n.01', 'woman.n.01', 'japan.n.01', 'korea.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/IMG-1Film-Still_The-Woman-The-Orphan-and-The-Tiger_Jane-Jin-Kaisen-and-Guston-Sondin_kung.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/IMG-1Film-Still_The-Woman-The-Orphan-and-The-Tiger_Jane-Jin-Kaisen-and-Guston-Sondin_kung-300x169.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/the-woman-the-orphan-and-the-tiger/,"['Society/11.362839697282423', 'Politics/1.7888888888888888', 'Cultural/1.6013071895424837']","['Society', 'Politics', 'Cultural']",14.753035775713796,"['War/4.449999999999999', 'Violence/3.645897832817337', 'Inequality/1.7888888888888888']","['War', 'Violence', 'Inequality']",9.884786721706224,"['Material_Physical/17.005427905427908', 'Society/14.733295625942684', 'Individual_Personal/7.930139451192082']","['Material_Physical', 'Society', 'Individual_Personal']",39.66886298256267,"['Land/12.060439560439562', 'Fantasy/5.284848484848485', 'Violence/4.639705882352941']","['Land', 'Fantasy', 'Violence']",21.98499392764099,0.3333333333333333,0.3333333333333333
Alicia Smith,"The title of Alicia Smith’s work, Teomama, means “God Carrier” in the Aztec language Nahuatl. It was the name given to medicine men and women who carried the bones of Huitzilopochtli—the god of war, sun, and human sacrifice in ancient Mexico, and the national deity of the Aztecs. Of the many legends featuring Huitzilopochtli, the origin story of Tenochtitlan (present day Mexico City) is perhaps one of the most well-known. It is said that he instructed the Aztecs to abandon their home in Aztlán and seek a new place to settle. The Teomamas carried their medicine bundles for 200 years down into Anahuac (a drainage basin that formed the ancient core of Mexico) looking for a sign they had arrived in their new home. They finally saw it when they reached Lake Texcoco: an eagle devouring a snake on a prickly pear cactus. A symbol of the union between sky and earth, a place where it was safe to build their city. And now, the image is widely recognizable as the coat of arms on the Mexican flag.  In the video, the artist acts as both Teomama and Tenochtitlan. She stands thigh-deep in a tranquil lake, while insects buzz in the background and fish intermittently breach the placid surface of the water. Bent at the waist, her torso hovers over the water unmoving, her hair and garment disappearing into a reflection of themselves. The long white dress is cinched at the waist with a belt similar to those worn by the Aztec priests, and her bent body acts as the island of Tenochtitlan; she is land, an offering plate, and carries god on her back. Her posture is one of abjection—an embodiment, Smith says, that has been long understood by her ancestors as a tool for accessing the sublime.  Art history is filled with attempts to capture the sublime: sweeping vistas of “uninhabited” forests, mountains, oceans, and meadows that depict the crushing power of a nature too wild to tame or understand. These are encounters characterized by a deep sense of wonder and awe. The idea of the sublime, too, is at the center of historical colonial narratives that seek to","Alicia Smith is a Xicana artist and activist. Her work uses the abject and sublime to investigate ideas related to the tension between greed and reverence, and its impact on the environment and our relationship to the female body. Through the use of video, performance, printmaking, and sculpture, Smith seeks to dissolve romanticized tropes that deny indigenous women their complexity, while at the same time demonstrating their beauty and strength. Smith describes her artistic practice as a means of unpacking her complicated relationship with her mixed-race heritage, the land, and her body, which she does depicts through powerful visual imagery.",Teomama,Americas,"['mexico.n.01', 'ancient.s.01', 'water.n.01', 'city.n.01', 'hair.n.01', 'mountain.n.01', 'narrative.n.01', 'sky.n.01', 'flag.n.01', 'national.a.01', 'brush.n.06', 'island.n.01', 'tool.n.01', 'earth.n.01', 'land.n.01', 'sign.n.01', 'day.n.01', 'symbol.n.01', 'contemplation.n.02', 'background.n.01', 'language.n.01', 'center.n.01', 'attempt.n.01', 'war.n.01', 'surface.n.01']","['myth.n.01', 'mexico.n.01', 'lake.n.01', 'foundation.n.01', 'eagle.n.01', 'body.n.01', 'female.n.02']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/IMG_Alicia-Smith_Teomama_AN-Amanda-Nudelman.jpeg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/IMG_Alicia-Smith_Teomama_AN-Amanda-Nudelman-300x169.jpeg,https://kadist.org/work/teomama/,"['Material_Physical/10.50449842555106', 'Cultural/5.077614379084968', 'Individual_Personal/2.0']","['Material_Physical', 'Cultural', 'Individual_Personal']",17.582112804636026,"['Space/6.346153846153846', 'Fantasy/5.077614379084968', 'Land/2.6198830409356724']","['Space', 'Fantasy', 'Land']",14.043651266174486,"['Society/25.40581771170007', 'Cultural/19.891044189728404', 'Material_Physical/18.677162199685423']","['Society', 'Cultural', 'Material_Physical']",63.9740241011139,"['Land/11.635928433451655', 'Urbanization/6.739768728004022', 'Arts/4.771794871794872']","['Land', 'Urbanization', 'Arts']",23.147492033250547,0.6666666666666666,0.3333333333333333
Juan Brenner,"Tonatiuh (The Son of the Sun) is a series of photographs in which photographer Juan Brenner carries out an in-depth visual study of current Guatemalan society from the perspective of miscegenation and the incalculable consequences of the Spanish conquest. Establishing Spanish conquistador Pedro de Alvarado as a central figure not only in the conquest of Guatemala, which in fact he was, but rather as a key figure in the formation of a complex, segregated and deeply troubled society, Brenner proposes a series of images that re-establish the lens through which both history and a contemporary Guatemalan can be looked at. Tonatiuh becomes a visual essay on the state of a country on the verge of failure and its incapacity to address its own history and learn from it.  The complete series (of 25 photographs) follows the steps of Pedro de Alvarado as he made his bloody and triumphal path into Guatemala from Southern Mexico, eventually claiming power over the country and its people. The group of images capture the complexities of cultural hybridization and, more poignantly, the way power, hierarchical structures and inequality are instrumentally continued through time. The images in the series suggest that rather than an inevitable event in the history of Mexico and Central America, the conquest was a deliberate effort to gain territory and enslave a population –that has, under different terms, remained so– in order to uphold a power system that unsurprisingly benefits only the top of the pyramid until today.","Born and raised in Guatemala, photographer Juan Brenner spent ten years in New York City working in the fashion industry before returning to his home country Guatemala in 2008.

Hwayeon Nam,"Imjingawa is Hwayeon Nam’s first foray into borrowing from the documentary form. The root of the work is a Japanese song with Korean diasporic connotations, which the artist heard inadvertently years ago. While tracking the inception and history of the song, her research explored the song’s potential to live beyond “legal, national, ideological, and geographical barriers.” The song earned its fame when it was introduced to the Japanese band, the Folk Crusaders. The version of Imjingawa sung by the Kyoto-based Folk Crusaders rose to great prominence. However, in 1968, the General Association of Korean residents in Japan submitted a copyright claim to Toshiba Records, claiming that this song was not a Japanese folk song, but a North Korean song composed by Jonghwan Koh with lyrics written by a North Korean poet, Seyoung Park. As a result, the sale of this album was suspended and banned from broadcasts, which ended up drawing more attention and fame as a result.  Tracing the time and space where Imjingawa was first sung and disseminated by people who heard it and sung in different ways, Nam discovered the time in which the ‘song’ was commonly shared and inherited. Imjingawa is also linked with the choreographic and performative methodology that the artist has persistently explored through her various works. Dwelling on her comment that “the path of thought is considered a movement,” we are encouraged to study which form the song, that comes from a different time and space, currently takes. Questions are incited by the independent and fragmented objects of the film: What does it mean to know an object? How can we indirectly experience something that ceases to exist? Movement of the artist’s thoughts on the song also carries with it the reality that the song may be sung differently every time.","Hwayeon Nam’s practice employs an artistic language that vigorously investigates the movement and phenomenon of various objects operating in sync with social systems, as well as the structure and nature of time. She unveils a history of human desires as well as collective sensibility, both through the work of tracking discovered archival objects. Her recent work is driven by extensive understanding of choreographic movement, with which her video sequences are finely elaborated. Nam strongly demonstrates her archival epistemology through vigorous exploration of cultural diasporic products such as song and dance; colonial acquisitions and stories of imperialistic treasure collecting; domains of natural science like flora and fauna, astronomy and so on. The subject of her works are mounted with human desires, reproduction of signs, acquisitiveness, and fantasy, fulfilling cultural projections over the long history of human existence. Her works not only pose the fundamental question of how we experience historicized symbols and representation from today’s ubiquitous but uniquely drifting images. Nam has been successful in choreographing and rehearsing time-navigation, through which archives breathe and animate toward the future.",Imjingawa,Asia,"['song.n.01', 'japanese.a.01', 'consequence.n.01', 'time.n.01', 'motion.n.03', 'analyze.v.01', 'object.n.01', 'japan.n.01', 'record.n.01', 'national.a.01', 'research.v.02', 'version.n.01', 'association.n.01', 'space.n.01', 'documentary.a.01', 'see.v.05', 'write.v.01', 'compose.v.01', 'attention.n.01', 'world.n.03', 'question.n.01', 'people.n.01']","['documentary.n.01', 'diaspora.n.03', 'song.n.01', 'stage_dancing.n.01', 'appropriation.n.03', 'ownership.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/imjingawa01.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/imjingawa01-300x169.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/imjingawa/,"['Cultural/15.627252142422424', 'Society/3.3070707070707073', 'Individual_Personal/1.561904761904762']","['Cultural', 'Society', 'Individual_Personal']",20.496227611397895,"['Arts/9.078519828984225', 'Media/3.2483660130718954', 'History/1.6181818181818182']","['Arts', 'Media', 'History']",13.945067660237939,"['Material_Physical/8.65072705072705', 'Individual_Personal/8.193772893772893', 'Society/8.174689362924656']","['Material_Physical', 'Individual_Personal', 'Society']",25.0191893074246,"['Time/4.325940725940725', 'Geopolitics/4.091503267973856', 'Community/3.315262515262515']","['Time', 'Geopolitics', 'Community']",11.732706509177095,0.6666666666666666,0.0
Walead Beshty,"Office Work consists of a partially deconstructed desktop monitor screen, cleanly speared through its center onto a metal pole. Despite its dismantled form, the screen still functions, a simple, mountain-range desktop background clearly visible with no distortion. As with much of Beshty’s work, Office Work thematizes its own construction, in this case, through a clearly deconstructive action that preserves the technological ontology present through the monitor. Rather than engage in outright destruction, Beshty carefully articulates the inner workings of the monitor outwards, alluding to the near violence of his action through the screen’s stark impalement. The work exists uneasily between display and destruction, disputing singularly positivist notions of constructing art.","Artist and writer Walead Beshty examines the processes of his own multidisciplinary (though primarily photographic) work’s production, linking these processes to global issues including human migration,displacement, and technology. His works, oftentimes visually abstracted, argue for their own production as a process of transformation, emphasizing an expansive array of actions and methods through which art can be structurally transformed or produced.

Simon Fujiwara,"Masks are a series of abstract paintings that together form a giant, fragmented portrait of German Chancellor, Angela Merkel’s face. Masks (Merkel F6.1)  was created in consultation with Merkel’s personal make-up artist; it  features the special makeup that Merkel wears for HD cameras applied onto canvas. The image has been magnified to a near-microscopic level, rendering an ambiguous skin tone across which the makeup’s denser patches produce an abstract composition. Masks is an exhaustive and fragmented documentary project that intimately depicts one of the world’s most powerful women with an entirely new set of images that disappear the closer you approach. In this way, it takes the conventions of ethnographic imagery to a posthuman dimension by  amplifying a constituent part of the complete subject of “Angela Merkel” to the point of unrecognizability.","The intersection of identity, memory, and history is taken up in Simon Fujiwara’s complex multimedia practice. The British-Japanese artist takes real world structures, thoughts, and events as his subject, constructing idiosyncratic narratives that emerge from these miasmatic creations. This work chronicles current conditions even as they demand attention in their capricious, oftentimes uncomfortable forms. While his practice borders on anthropological in its examinations, the products that derive from his work oftentimes turns their speculation towards the work’s viewership, who become affectively compelled to examine their own subjectivity in interacting with Fujiwara’s oeuvre.",Masks (Merkel F6.1),Europe,"['mask.n.01', 'abstract.a.01', 'documentary.n.01', 'imagination.n.02', 'form.v.01', 'tone.n.01', 'dimension.n.01', 'degree.n.01', 'set.n.01', 'personal.a.01', 'composition.n.01', 'image.n.01', 'woman.n.01', 'portrayal.n.01', 'subject.n.01', 'undertaking.n.01', 'camera.n.01', 'make.v.03', 'series.n.01']","['mask.n.01', 'make_up.v.09']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Simon-Fujiwara-masks.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Simon-Fujiwara-masks-213x300.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/masks-merkel-f6-1/,"['Society/0.8', 'Material_Physical/0.7692307692307693', 'Cultural/0.7692307692307693']","['Society', 'Material_Physical', 'Cultural']",2.3384615384615386,"['Economy/0.8', 'Arts/0.7692307692307693', 'Materiality/0.7692307692307693']","['Economy', 'Arts', 'Materiality']",2.3384615384615386,"['Cultural/11.38823529411765', 'Individual_Personal/9.836028986493384', 'Material_Physical/6.476276664511958']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Material_Physical']",27.700540945122988,"['Mind/4.136780866192631', 'Media/3.3701357466063344', 'Culture/3.1076923076923078']","['Mind', 'Media', 'Culture']",10.614608920491273,0.6666666666666666,0.0
Mario García Torres,"In Up All Night, Waiting for the Chelsea Hotel Magic to Spark My Creativity Mario García Torres constructs and documents a hypothetical scene, situating himself within a lineage of artists and creatives that used to congregate at the historic hotel. The long-exposure capture depicts García Torres himself at multiple stages of brainstorming, devising, and introspection, his ethereal figure connected with artistic giants of the past. Yet, there is also an insipid tone beyond mere insomnia or frustration at the lack of being able to garner inspiration. There is a sinking ennui as Garci Torres mulls in the shadows of the room, longing for this moment of inertia to be circumvented by a Eureka moment, quite literally signified by the lightbulbs in the room.","Mario García Torres is a conceptual artist who engages with various media in his practice, including film, sound, performance, ‘museographic installations’ and video. García Torres often cites untold or ‘minor’ histories, with a predilection for avant-garde art and music from the 1960s and 70s as departing points for his work. He has recreated historical exhibitions and has even ‘completed’ unfinished artworks, often blurring original and reenactment, past and present, while questioning universal ideas about truth, certainty and time – all core ideas in the development of his body of work.","Up All Night, Waiting for the Chelsea Hotel Magic to Spark my Creativity",Americas,"['moment.n.01', 'tone.n.01', 'shadow.n.01', 'phase.n.01', 'night.n.01', 'multiple.a.01', 'concept.n.01', 'document.n.01', 'artist.n.01', 'figure.n.01', 'scene.n.01']","['hotel.n.01', 'inspiration.n.01', 'genius.n.04', 'creativity.n.01', 'historic.s.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Up_all_Night09-copy.jpeg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Up_all_Night09-copy-300x200.jpeg,https://kadist.org/work/up-all-night-waiting-for-the-chelsea-hotel-magic-to-spark-my-creativity/,"['Individual_Personal/11.643956043956045', 'Cultural/10.68781512605042', 'Politics/1.6025641025641026']","['Individual_Personal', 'Cultural', 'Politics']",23.934335272570568,"['Mind/6.729670329670329', 'Fantasy/4.237362637362637', 'Values/3.3142857142857145']","['Mind', 'Fantasy', 'Values']",14.281318681318682,"['Individual_Personal/13.114285714285716', 'Cultural/11.04660633484163', 'Material_Physical/9.088644688644688']","['Individual_Personal', 'Cultural', 'Material_Physical']",33.24953673777203,"['Values/3.447619047619048', 'Time/3.3333333333333335', 'Body/3.2051282051282053']","['Values', 'Time', 'Body']",9.986080586080586,0.6666666666666666,0.3333333333333333
Eko Nugroho,"Nugroho’s installations and performances have their roots in the shadow puppet rituals in Indonesia, particularly the Javanese Wayang tradition whose essence is in the representation of the shadows. Nugroho’s work both preserves traditional culture and offers a contemporary interpretation of it through his insertion of comical figures to comment on current social conditions. Moving Landscape includes characters such as a diamond-headed man, a UFO, and other items that appear frequently in Nugroho’s drawings and murals. The shadows and silhouettes rotate in a custom-made, lit tent structure to create a fantasy world that blurs the line between daily life and fiction. The narratives here are complex and ambiguous and speak to a range of psychological states that echo everyday reality.","Working with a variety of media including comics, animation, mural painting, graffiti, embroidery, video, and puppetry, Yogyakarta-based artist Eko Nugroho comments on social justice, cultural tradition, and the human condition. The concepts, materials, and strategies of his oeuvre reflect a sophisticated understanding of “fine art,” crafts, as well as street art. For example, Nugroho’s use of embroidery is inspired by local street gangs whose jackets are embroidered with their logos and by the embroidered badges worn by local government officials to announce their affiliations. After the Indonesian Reformation in 1998, Nugroho started to use caricature in his work to criticize the government’s policies about democracy, freedom, and censorship. These metamorphic figures, their surroundings, and the idioms indicate the dysfunction of contemporary Indonesian society as well as the tribulations of the world at large.",Its Always Fun to Live in This Country,Unspecified,"['shadow.n.01', 'psychological.s.01', 'current.a.01', 'installation.n.01', 'daily.s.01', 'complex.a.01', 'interpretation.n.01', 'fiction.n.01', 'traditional.a.01', 'tradition.n.01', 'structure.n.01', 'everyday.s.01', 'representation.n.01', 'contemporary.s.01', 'fictional_character.n.01', 'drawing.n.01', 'performance.n.01', 'world.n.03', 'figure.n.01', 'culture.n.01', 'make.v.03', 'landscape.n.01', 'social.a.01', 'narrative.n.01', 'life.n.01']","['fantasy.n.02', 'traditional.a.01', 'reality.n.03', 'shadow.n.01', 'psychological.s.01', 'everyday.s.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/eko_nugroho_its_always_fun_to_live_in_this_country2.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/eko_nugroho_its_always_fun_to_live_in_this_country2-300x200.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/its-always-fun-to-live-in-this-country/,"['Cultural/5.39656862745098', 'Material_Physical/4.34945054945055', 'Individual_Personal/2.3619909502262444']","['Cultural', 'Material_Physical', 'Individual_Personal']",12.108010127127775,"['Fantasy/5.39656862745098', 'Materiality/2.5494505494505497', 'Spirituality/1.5927601809954752']","['Fantasy', 'Materiality', 'Spirituality']",9.538779357897004,"['Cultural/42.418456706692', 'Individual_Personal/34.45319435466495', 'Material_Physical/15.195671304959232']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Material_Physical']",92.06732236631618,"['Mind/15.283688860159451', 'Culture/11.923076923076925', 'Fantasy/11.534207622442915']","['Mind', 'Culture', 'Fantasy']",38.74097340567929,1.0,0.3333333333333333
Minouk Lim,"New Town Ghost (2005) is one of Lim’s trio of large-scale video installations. (The other two are S.O.S—Adoptive Dissensus [2009] and The Weight of Hands [2010].) The series grew out of her interest in capturing lost memories and the collective unconscious in rapidly globalizing cities such as Seoul. New Town Ghost documents a young female activist who is standing aggressively on a truck, rapping slam poetry through a megaphone to the rhythm of a nearby drummer. The two performers are from the Yeongdeungpo district, which has been drastically transformed by development from an industrial zone into a “new town” full of giant department stores and mega-brands. Yeongdeungpo is symbolic of many transformations witnessed by a young generation of Koreans. For Lim it is a dystopian place where the idea of a better future is simply delusional. The poem, talking about the new malls, the skyscrapers derides not only neoliberalism but also the indifferent citizens who have apparently sold their souls to it.","Motivated by a desire to understand the complex relationship between the behaviors of urban individuals and their surroundings, Minouk Lim creates videos and performance works that actively engage with the dynamics of city life. By exposing the problematic and contradictory aspects of the everyday, she critically comments on the absurdity of rapid development and power dynamics in today’s neoliberal economic system. Collaborations with artists, the public, and other cultural producers generate creative energy in Lim’s practice, and diversify her visual language.",New Town Ghost,Asia,"['town.n.01', 'ghost.n.01', 'shop.n.01', 'transform.v.01', 'female.a.01', 'rhythm.n.01', 'militant.n.01', 'transformation.n.01', 'district.n.01', 'lose.v.01', 'hands.n.01', 'coevals.n.01', 'development.n.01', 'installation.n.01', 'symbolic.a.01', 'future.n.01', 'corporate.s.03', 'document.n.01', 'idea.n.01', 'memory.n.01', 'city.n.01', 'video.n.01']","['gentrification.n.01', 'protest.n.03', 'expunction.n.01', 'dystopia.n.01', 'commercialization.n.01', 'neoliberalism.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/minouk_lim_new_town_ghost1.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/minouk_lim_new_town_ghost1-300x225.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/new-town-ghost/,"['Politics/8.626960784313725', 'Society/3.764705882352941', 'Cultural/3.3396825396825394']","['Politics', 'Society', 'Cultural']",15.731349206349204,"['Politics/4.2107843137254894', 'Economy/1.9411764705882353', 'Activism/1.875']","['Politics', 'Economy', 'Activism']",8.026960784313726,"['Material_Physical/30.54313007254185', 'Society/24.223349199819797', 'Individual_Personal/20.979731379731387']","['Material_Physical', 'Society', 'Individual_Personal']",75.74621065209304,"['Land/14.826229979171158', 'Urbanization/14.737523913994504', 'Time/8.628255404725993']","['Land', 'Urbanization', 'Time']",38.19200929789165,0.3333333333333333,0.0
Dinh Q. Lê,"Hill of Poisonous Trees (three men) (2008) exemplifies the artist’s signature photo-weaving technique, in which he collects diverse found photographs—portraits of anonymous people, stills from blockbuster films, or journalistic images—cuts them into strips, and weaves them into new composition. The title of the series is translated from the Khmer phrase Tuol Sleng, which literally means a poisonous hill or a place on a mound to keep those who bear or supply guilt, and the photographs came from the Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum in Cambodia, a former prison where at least 200,000 Cambodians were executed during the reign of the Khmer Rouge between 1975 and 1979. In this particular image, three men stand against the backdrop of what looks like a prison interior. Their identities are unknown. The ghostly, illuminated space creates a strange effect of time traveling, transporting viewers back to the historical event depicted. The men’s gazes seem to tell stories that have been buried in collective memory. For Lê, the act of appropriating, recycling, and remixing imagery is a means of rescuing both images and the memories embedded within them.","Dinh Q. Lê’s artistic practice centers on his lived experience of political and social conditions in his native Vietnam; he and his family fled the country via Thailand in 1979 and immigrated to the United States. Lê interweaves the experiences that helped shape his identity with Vietnamese national mythologies, collective memories, and expanded cultural histories. Incorporating imagery from a variety of sources, such as archival photographs, documentaries, Hollywood films, and Vietnamese iconography, Lê’s investigations raise critical questions about the distribution, reception, and consumption of images, and how images inform national identity.",Untitled (from the Hill of Poisonous Tree Series),Unspecified,"['prison.n.01', 'memory.n.01', 'phrase.n.01', 'unknown.a.01', 'imagination.n.02', 'backdrop.n.01', 'anonymous.a.01', 'strange.a.01', 'picture.v.02', 'tree.n.01', 'viewing_audience.n.01', 'technique.n.01', 'corporate.s.03', 'museum.n.01', 'composition.n.01', 'event.n.01', 'historical.a.01', 'image.n.01', 'identity.n.01', 'people.n.01', 'title.n.01', 'narrative.n.01', 'movie.n.01', 'space.n.01', 'photograph.n.01']","['photography.n.01', 'portrait.n.02', 'genocide.n.01', 'trauma.n.02', 'memory.n.01', 'image.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/dinh_q__le_untitled_from_the_hill_of_poisonous_trees_three_men_2008_47.25x78.75.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/dinh_q__le_untitled_from_the_hill_of_poisonous_trees_three_men_2008_47.25x78.75-300x183.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/untitled-from-the-hill-of-poisonous-tree-series/,"['Cultural/11.610214072133578', 'Individual_Personal/10.131868131868131', 'Society/6.162605510431597']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Society']",27.904687714433308,"['Mind/4.934065934065934', 'Culture/4.615384615384616', 'Violence/3.536231884057971']","['Mind', 'Culture', 'Violence']",13.085682433508522,"['Cultural/26.837085953262427', 'Individual_Personal/15.588815106462166', 'Material_Physical/7.749206349206348']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Material_Physical']",50.17510740893094,"['Media/6.930794369029663', 'Mind/6.67524240465417', 'Culture/5.615384615384615']","['Media', 'Mind', 'Culture']",19.221421389068446,0.6666666666666666,0.6666666666666666
Tsang Kin-Wah,"The Third Seal—They Are Already Old. They Don’t Need To Exist Anymore is part of The Seven Seals, Tsang’s ongoing series of digital videos that are projected as installations onto the walls and ceilings of dark rooms. Using texts and computer technology, the series draws its reference from various sources—the Bible, Judeo-Christian eschatology, existentialism, metaphysics, politics, among others—to articulate the world’s complexity and the dilemmas that people face while approaching “the end of the world.” The Third Seal is a nineteen-by-twenty-seven-foot projection on a single wall that, together with sound, creates an immersive and dynamic environment. Crawling up from the bottom of the wall are black, worm-like texts that comment on class struggle, revolutionary riots, labor and production, human existence, and social justice. Without a clear beginning or end, the work suggests a cycle and the non-linear nature of history, and, by extension, life and death.","Navigating relationships among words, images, and languages, Tsang Kin-Wah’s text-based work span various media: wall prints, silkscreen, and digital video projections. His wallpaper prints usually feature beautiful floral patterns that recall the swirls of nineteenth-century decorative wallpapers. However, upon closer inspection, details reveal the patterns to be composed of text in both English and Chinese characters. Their provocative and sometimes offensive meanings mock art, the art market, the artist and his Chinese ethnicity, as well as other broader culture issues. In 2009, Tsang began experimenting with new media and produced The Seven Seals, an ongoing series of digital video installation works that takes its name from the New Testament’s Book of Revelation. Tsang’s practice allows a range of interpretations and encourages viewers to search the relationship between image and text, between pictographic and phonetic writing systems.","The Third Seal-They Are Already Old, They Don't Need to Exist Anymore",Asia,"['wall.n.01', 'dark.n.01', 'complexity.n.01', 'being.n.01', 'struggle.n.01', 'projection.n.01', 'class.n.01', 'installation.n.01', 'technology.n.01', 'politics.n.01', 'digital.a.01', 'production.n.01', 'death.n.01', 'individual.a.01', 'series.n.01', 'sound.n.01', 'environment.n.01', 'mention.n.01', 'nature.n.01', 'black.a.01', 'human.a.01', 'people.n.01', 'social.a.01', 'history.n.01', 'life.n.01']","['text.n.01', 'death.n.01', 'life.n.01', 'history.n.01', 'religion.n.02', 'society.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/tsang_kin-wah_the_third_seal.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/tsang_kin-wah_the_third_seal-300x200.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/the-third-seal-they-are-already-old-they-dont-need-to-exist-anymore/,"['Material_Physical/5.837296037296038', 'Cultural/5.164835164835165', 'Individual_Personal/4.666666666666667']","['Material_Physical', 'Cultural', 'Individual_Personal']",15.66879786879787,"['Language/2.857142857142857', 'Spirituality/2.8333333333333335', 'Time/2.6321678321678323']","['Language', 'Spirituality', 'Time']",8.322644022644024,"['Material_Physical/20.88181557005087', 'Society/17.310500610500615', 'Individual_Personal/16.5169249051602']","['Material_Physical', 'Society', 'Individual_Personal']",54.70924108571168,"['Materiality/6.687412587412588', 'Politics/5.027350427350427', 'Time/4.994158782394077']","['Materiality', 'Politics', 'Time']",16.708921797157092,0.6666666666666666,0.3333333333333333
Jompet Kuswidananto,"Third Realm (2011) grew out of the artist’s long-term research of Indonesia’s colonial history and the processes of modernization and urbanization that have taken place there. Kuswidananto describes the nation as perpetually in an “in-between” state of transition. Thus he has developed the concept of a third reality, third space, or third body—an identity specifically for Indonesia that reflects its spatial realities and national character. The uniforms and horse saddles in the installation are of the type used in festival parades. Instead of directly commenting on colonial military history, the ghostly and bodiless outfits hauntingly suggest something out of the past. The addition of video and sound exacerbates this effect. This highly theatrical work not only reenacts traditional mythology but also foregrounds its unstable nature.

Jianwei Wang,"In Dilemma: Three Way Fork in the Road, Wang references Peking opera in a re-interpretation of traditional text. The performance begins with two broad-knife-wielding characters circling each other in conventional operatic steps. Oblivious to the presence of these two on stage, additional characters, in a mix of period costume and contemporary dress, enter the stage in increasing droves to consume a various of foods laid out on a table until they collapse and pile on top of each other. Invoking the traditional Chinese theatrical trope of a “three-way fork in the road,” the piece ruminates on the representation of the visible and the invisible and the simultaneity of past and present as critical reflection on the shortcomings of both antiquarianism and technocratic modernity.","Born in Sichuan Province, China in 1958, Wang Jianwei was trained as a painter at the Zhejiang Academy of Fine Arts (current China Academy of Fine Arts) in Hangzhou. Despite displaying technical virtuosity as a painter, Wang chose a working method that combines video, film and theater. Interested in combining the mundane, the historical, and the mythological, Wang’s works range from depicting the “plight of peasants occupying an abandoned housing project in Sichuan Province to films of post-1949 China during the height of Communist fervor and stories from the Tang Dynasty.” Particularly, poignant is the cognitive dissonance formed between presentations of the past and present in Wang’s work.","Dilemma, three way of fork in the road",Asia,"['phase.n.01', 'traditional.a.01', 'fictional_character.n.01', 'food.n.01', 'chinese.a.01', 'invisible.a.01', 'conventional.a.01', 'critical.a.01', 'put.v.01', 'visible.a.01', 'contemplation.n.02', 'time_period.n.01', 'presence.n.01', 'representation.n.01', 'contemporary.s.01', 'performance.n.01', 'piece.n.01']","['invisible.a.01', 'dramaturgy.n.01', 'simultaneity.n.01', 'chinese.a.01', 'opera.n.01', 'modernity.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/wang_jianwei_dilemma.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/wang_jianwei_dilemma-300x200.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/dilemma-three-way-of-fork-in-the-road/,"['Cultural/5.2153846153846155', 'Society/0.9333333333333333']","['Cultural', 'Society']",6.148717948717949,"['Arts/1.7692307692307692', 'Media/1.6', 'History/0.9333333333333333']","['Arts', 'Media', 'History']",4.302564102564102,"['Individual_Personal/25.31099678615159', 'Cultural/12.176422863342369', 'Material_Physical/10.575671696724328']","['Individual_Personal', 'Cultural', 'Material_Physical']",48.063091346218286,"['Mind/8.397632372787172', 'Body/5.87062937062937', 'Spirituality/5.52991452991453']","['Mind', 'Body', 'Spirituality']",19.798176273331073,0.4,0.0
Huang Xiaopeng,"Four knives appearing as if thrown at the wall to alleviate frustration and boredom, form rhythmic shadows and markings of time above a translated phrase boldly printed in simplified Chinese and English. While the English reads “But Now I Manufacture Hate, Every Single Day,” the Chinese, resultant from Google Translate in 2011, reads awkwardly to something meaning “now I manufacture black special.” The term “black special” is derived from a transliteration of the word “hate” into the sound “heite”, where the corresponding written characters literally denote “black special”.  The rigidity of the machine translation also preserved the syntax of English, forcing the Chinese to crudely abide by English grammar. With the emotional force of the word “hate” blunted and subverted by the translation, Huang’s piece highlights the manner in which the commodification of emotion and language in contemporary technocratic mass culture jam communication in the name of democratic literacy.","Xiaopeng Huang is a video and installation artist. He explores the role of language, (mis)translation, and technology in international “cultural exchanges,” highlighting the production of political paradoxes, absurdity, and violence that result from attempts to produce exact translations.

Gimhongsok,"To explore the boundaries between artwork and audience, Gimhongsok created a series of sculptural performances in which a person wearing an animal costume poses in the gallery. Bunny’s Sofa is a continuation of this series, but with a different twist. Instead of hiring a real person to dress as the animal, Gimhongsok placed a mannequin inside the rabbit costume. When exhibiting the work, the artist produces a false statement claiming that he has paid an illegal worker from North Korea to wear the suit and to maintain a lounging posture for a certain length of time. But both the performer and the financial transaction existed only in the text, truths concealed by the costume and social propriety. By interchanging physical realities and contexts and obscuring details, Gimhongsok challenges the effectiveness of visual and textual communication to create a potential moral anxiety in the viewers.","Raising questions about South Korea’s position in the world beyond its own social and political borders, Seoul-based artist Gimhongsok investigates communication, language, and popular culture. Gimhongsok’s ideas and deadpan satirical humor manifest themselves in many media and, because his creative process and personal style remain enigmatic, he is considered to be a “mysterious genius” in his homeland. Whether overt or implicit in their message, Gimhongsok’s spectacular works juxtapose image and language to lure viewers into a labyrinthine journey towards ever-elusive meaning.",Bunny’s Sofa,Asia,"['person.n.01', 'statement.n.01', 'potential.a.01', 'keep.v.01', 'airs.n.01', 'research.v.02', 'worker.n.01', 'animal.n.01', 'sculptural.a.01', 'details.n.01', 'audience.n.01', 'viewing_audience.n.01', 'physical.a.01', 'series.n.01', 'artwork.n.01', 'real.a.01', 'context.n.01', 'performance.n.01', 'world.n.03', 'ocular.a.02', 'make.v.03', 'social.a.01', 'time.n.01']","['fake.n.01', 'costume.n.01', 'ethic.n.01', 'korea.n.01', 'labor.n.02', 'labor.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/gimhongsok_bunnys_sofa.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/gimhongsok_bunnys_sofa-300x199.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/bunnys-sofa/,"['Individual_Personal/5.259786721706226', 'Society/4.433333333333334', 'Cultural/3.9790849673202615']","['Individual_Personal', 'Society', 'Cultural']",13.672205022359822,"['Values/3.6597867217062263', 'Economy/2.8', 'Community/1.6333333333333333']","['Values', 'Economy', 'Community']",8.09312005503956,"['Cultural/10.821478521478522', 'Society/7.341025641025642', 'Individual_Personal/5.503296703296703']","['Cultural', 'Society', 'Individual_Personal']",23.66580086580087,"['Fantasy/3.375757575757576', 'Power/3.2', 'Arts/2.766233766233766']","['Fantasy', 'Power', 'Arts']",9.341991341991342,1.0,0.0
Naufus Ramírez-Figueroa,"Naufus Ramírez-Figueroa’s work Illusion of Matter was made specifically for the camera and established a dream state through a composition of motifs that were drawn from childhood memories, and that were recreated as giant props made out of polystyrene set in a colorful yellow and orange mise-en-scene. Throughout the five minutes of the performance, the props and set were activated and demolished by children under the artist’s direction. The performance ends as the artist walking slowly towards the camera holding a ghostly mask/figure in front of their body. This work was the first in the ongoing commission by the performance network Corpus, in which the artist attempts to exhaust my interest into the Guatemalan Civil War (1960-96). The work was commissioned by Tate Modern’s “Live Series” and Corpus Network.","In Naufus Ramírez-Figueroa’s performative practice, narrative and its corresponding sculptural props play a major role in weaving together pre-Columbian civilizations, seditious brotherhoods, evangelism, and imperialism. In an unsettling dream-like fashion, many of his works operate as non-narrative fictions that depart from his personal experience of Guatemalan history—particularly the country’s civil war that ran from 1960 to 1996 and in which members of his family took an active part—but always distancing himself from a documentary take on history. Thus, the artist creates fable-like situations, which mix memories and visions from his childhood with the right dose of pathos and humor, and that address further cultural and political events such as the war’s genocide of Mayan populations, the infiltration of Mormon missionaries in the country, and the contemporary followers of apocalyptic conspiracies.",Illusion of Matter,Americas,"['network.n.01', 'performance.n.01', 'camera.n.01', 'illusion.n.01', 'motif.n.01', 'ongoing.s.01', 'pull.v.01', 'matter.n.01', 'dream.n.01', 'put.v.01', 'set.n.01', 'child.n.01', 'attempt.n.01', 'composition.n.01', 'war.n.01', 'memory.n.01', 'body.n.01', 'series.n.01']","['war.n.01', 'colonialism.n.01', 'movement.n.04', 'power.n.01', 'autochthonal.s.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_KPerformanceRoom_NRamirezFigueroa_08-copy.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_KPerformanceRoom_NRamirezFigueroa_08-copy-300x200.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/illusion-of-matter/,"['Society/12.04142832571625', 'Politics/5.020928194612405', 'Individual_Personal/2.6']","['Society', 'Politics', 'Individual_Personal']",19.662356520328657,"['War/3.511904761904762', 'Violence/3.3406346749226', 'Colonization/2.7777777777777777']","['War', 'Violence', 'Colonization']",9.630317214605139,"['Cultural/17.531135531135536', 'Material_Physical/14.565287653522951', 'Individual_Personal/12.798778998779001']","['Cultural', 'Material_Physical', 'Individual_Personal']",44.89520218343749,"['Space/8.769683257918551', 'Mind/4.338461538461539', 'Spirituality/4.146031746031746']","['Space', 'Mind', 'Spirituality']",17.254176542411837,0.3333333333333333,0.0
Indira Allegra,"Open Casket IX is an installation by Indira Allegra that combines traditional materials of memorial—tombstones, mausoleums, and caskets—with contemporary expressions of grief. The work is a memorial for people who have lost loved ones to police violence, and part of the Open Casket series, which is concerned more broadly with the need to recognize grieving as a collective responsibility, rather than an individual misfortune to be shouldered by one affected person or family.  At the center of the installation lies 2,500 pounds of broken stones arranged on the floor in a circle: a shape that embraces the cyclical nature of grief. A woven grid of square videos is projected along the top third of the wall around the perimeter of the room. Each video depicts an interview with a person who has lost a loved one to police violence, which Allegra collected over the course of several months from news archives online. Its pattern represents what weavers call a drawdown—a method for visualizing which threads are visible on the front or back of a textile—and is the same one made for crepe, a fabric commonly used to line caskets. A viscerally haunting audio composition—a remix of groans, wails, desperate pleas, and heated admonitions drawn from the interviews—roots the work in the space. These primal sounds of grief ring out from beneath the piles of rocks in erratic intervals, perhaps speaking to grief’s tendency to surface as a series of fits and starts.  Open Casket IX builds a memorial from the physical and digital wreckage left in sorrow’s wake. But instead of creating a place for visitors to leave flowers and take nothing, the work asks one to consider sharing in the mourning—an act described by the artist as an innovation in grieving.  The mourners seen and heard in this work include:  Darnelle Bell, best friend of Gerald Javon Hall (1987 – 2016).  Diamond Reynolds, partner of Philandro Castille (1984 – 2016).  Jasmin Lloyd, girlfriend of Frank Clark (1984 – 2016).  Margaret Johnson, mother of Norman Gary (1987 – 2016).  Monique Douglas, cousin of Jamal Rollins (1995 – 2016).  Monique Morgan, mother of Carnell Snell (1997 – 2016).  Karonisha Ramsey, mother of Kajuan Raye (1997 – 2016).  Michelle Raye, aunt of Kajuan Raye (1997 – 2016).","Indira Allegra uses text and textile production—a combined material she designates as a “text/ile”—to embody unseen forces like memory, haunting, grief, and emotions born from trauma. Toni Morrison has written that “invisible things are not necessarily not-there,” and it is in this space of not-thereness that Allegra’s work resides. She works to reveal and center the histories and experiences, often violent or traumatic, of people and places that have been rendered invisible.  Her practice explores how the ancient technology of weaving can offer contemporary insights into human patterns. She defines weaving as the crossing of any two forces held under tension, which acts a generative creative material. Informed by months of research and making, her weavings, photographs, installations, performances, videos, and writing are often site-responsive, incorporating the tensions of the spaces, materials, and objects she encounters. For Allegra, each of these things is alive with memory and functions as a collaborator in the art-making process.  These tensions might also be described as hauntings, which scholar Avery F. Gordon describes as a “repressed or unresolved social violence is making itself known.” Allegra’s practice expresses that which haunts us as a society, both locally and globally: the history of gay-bashings in San Francisco, police violence, suicide, public lynchings, exile, and physical ailments and disability. But her work also seeks to recuperate grief as a collective act, a shift that might relieve some of the burden suffered by the body and materials that act as containers for these histories.",Open Casket IX,Americas,"['mother.n.01', 'lose.v.01', 'rock.n.01', 'violence.n.01', 'person.n.01', 'grid.n.01', 'interview.n.01', 'method.n.01', 'visitor.n.01', 'pull.v.01', 'leave.v.01', 'form.n.03', 'expression.n.01', 'fabric.n.01', 'floor.n.01', 'digital.a.01', 'video.n.01', 'visible.a.01', 'corporate.s.03', 'traditional.a.01', 'physical.a.01', 'individual.a.01', 'series.n.01', 'sound.n.01', 'center.n.01']","['coffin.n.01', 'grief.n.01', 'gravestone.n.01', 'violence.n.01', 'memorial.n.03', 'weave.v.01', 'fabric.n.01', 'mourning.n.01', 'mausoleum.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/1.-Open_Casket_IX.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/1.-Open_Casket_IX-300x210.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/open-casket-ix/,"['Society/6.300883430295196', 'Individual_Personal/5.959706959706959', 'Politics/2.541176470588235']","['Society', 'Individual_Personal', 'Politics']",14.801766860590389,"['Emotion/4.359706959706959', 'Arts/2.3692307692307693', 'Violence/1.9411764705882353']","['Emotion', 'Arts', 'Violence']",8.670114199525964,"['Material_Physical/15.197069597069603', 'Society/9.87780650721827', 'Cultural/9.131221719457015']","['Material_Physical', 'Society', 'Cultural']",34.20609782374489,"['Space/7.203296703296703', 'Design/4.230769230769231', 'Power/3.1692307692307695']","['Space', 'Design', 'Power']",14.603296703296703,0.3333333333333333,0.0
La Decanatura,"In Centro Espacial Satelital de Colombia, La Decanatura plays tribute to two “stunning” satellite antennas installed in the small municipality of Chocontá where, in 1970, the Space Communications Center of Colombia was inaugurated. That same year, the first antenna, responsible for the transmission (via microwave) of radio and telephone signals was put in place and eleven years later, the second antenna or Ground Station for International Communications would complete the complex known as Space Communications Center. Excursions to visit what became known as the “Satellite City of Colombia” were common for decades. Today, due to unforgiving weather, change in political interests, and the “advancement” of technology, the antennas are now relics of an all-but-forgotten technological prime. Forewarning the rapid acceleration of technological obsolescence under late-capitalism, they are in physical deterioration and their cultural allure has waned.  As a performance, Centro Espacial Satelital de Colombia, is at once a tribute, a “lullaby” and a farewell to the abandoned satellite station. In the video, the Chocontá Symphonic Youth Band, whose members range from seven to fifteen (and are too young to have known the antennas in their splendor), perform an interpretation of a requiem replete with nostalgia, not so much for the antennas themselves, but rather, for a grandiose future that never came to fruition. The imposing natural landscape and gloomy weather complete the atmosphere, as the antennas appear to be slowly absorbed by the surrounding bucolic meadow. Among the trees, the obsolete antennas and children full of potential, the performance evokes a glorious past, an agonizing present, and an uncertain future.","La Decanatura is a collective composed of Bogotá-based artists Elkin Caldero? Guevara and Diego Piñeros García, whose projects generate new approaches to art from hybrid perspectives and disciplines, questioning hegemonic forms of knowledge and power. La Decanatura mobilizes displacement and recontextualization in order to explore alternate presents and futures, and to create links between memory and the ruins of the past in order to question our assumptions of reality and linear readings of history. Through the moving image and building on a “poetics of time and space”, the play with mise-en-scene to create events, places and objects that might or might not be “real”.

Tom Nicholson,"Comparative monument (Palestine) engages a peculiar Australian monumental tradition: war monuments that bear the name “Palestine”. Countless of these monuments were built immediately after World War I to commemorate the presence of Australian troops in Palestine. The Australian troops had entered Palestine in 1917 after fighting the Turks threatening the Suez Canal with the British, when the main focus was on the European fronts rather than on the Middle East campaign. Scattered all over Australia, these monuments also reflect the realities of the 1920s (when they were erected) during the era of the British mandate, when the name Palestine implicitly invoked the shared position of Australia and Palestine within British imperialism.   Comparative monument (Palestine) takes the form of nice stacks of posters for visitors to take away. Each poster is a proposal for a new monument bearing the name “Palestine” in and around Melbourne. Re-animating these linkages between Australia and Palestine, the posters implicate the events and repercussions of 1948 Palestine war till today, along with their echoes of Australian Aboriginal experiences of dispossession and colonial violence. Each poster features different forms such as pavilions, rotundas, obelisks, cenotaphs, and elevated statues of Australian soldiers. The stacks never exceed knee height. Visitors are encouraged to remove posters and display them elsewhere, in the process partially privatizing and diluting this particular memory with other, unknown, memories.   Comparative monument (Palestine) attempts to re-think the possibilities of the monument in the face of Australia’s histories of dispossession, and the acts of imagination and solidarity these histories demand. The work also deploys printed matter to generate ephemeral public actions, in particular through processes of distribution that generate a field of dispersed social encounters.","Tom Nicholson is trained in drawing, a medium which he has used to re-think the relationships between public actions and their traces, between propositions and monuments, and between writing and images. He has made a number of works engaging aspects of Australia’s colonial history, using combinations of drawings, monumental forms, and posters, often articulating these histories in relation to the histories of other places. His work is often nourished by his disciplinary training in drawing, and particularly drawing’s character as a prospective form, or a process dedicated to meditating upon forms that are yet-to-be.",Comparative monument (Palestine),Unspecified,"['memorial.n.03', 'poster.n.01', 'british.a.01', 'visitor.n.01', 'war.n.01', 'memory.n.01', 'procedure.n.01', 'soldier.n.01', 'east.n.01', 'ephemeral.s.01', 'unknown.a.01', 'field.n.01', 'history.n.01', 'brush.n.06', 'imagination.n.01', 'matter.n.01', 'form.n.01', 'era.n.01', 'position.n.01', 'possibility.n.01', 'presence.n.01', 'tradition.n.01', 'violence.n.01', 'center.n.01', 'event.n.01']","['memorial.n.03', 'palestine.n.02', 'drawing.n.02', 'war.n.01', 'poster.n.01', 'proposal.n.01', 'australia.n.01', 'colonialism.n.01', 'violence.n.01', 'eviction.n.02', 'solidarity.n.01', 'imagination.n.01', 'distribution.n.03', 'ephemeral.s.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/02.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/02-300x208.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/comparative-monument-palestine/,"['Society/7.844133807369102', 'Cultural/7.784917043740574', 'Material_Physical/7.1912087912087905']","['Society', 'Cultural', 'Material_Physical']",22.820259642318465,"['Land/6.421978021978021', 'Arts/4.1692307692307695', 'War/2.75']","['Land', 'Arts', 'War']",13.34120879120879,"['Individual_Personal/33.23168498168499', 'Society/29.082525317819442', 'Material_Physical/22.439854753090053']","['Individual_Personal', 'Society', 'Material_Physical']",84.75406505259448,"['Mind/10.77948717948718', 'Spirituality/9.748168498168498', 'Time/7.544988344988344']","['Mind', 'Spirituality', 'Time']",28.072644022644024,0.6666666666666666,0.0
Sky Hopinka,"Dislocation Blues by Sky Hopinka is a portrait of the 2016 Standing Rock protests against the Dakota Access Pipeline in South Dakota. Working against grand narratives and myth-making, Hopinka attempts to provide a clear look towards the participants of the protest movement and the protectors of the water – their testimonies, reflections and histories. Cleo Keahna tells about the everyday life of the camp and its difficulties; Terry Running Wild shares his dreams for the future. Dislocation Blues is a unique perspective on a protest that garnered much attention from the media, raising questions about social justice, environmentalism and the connection between humanity and nature in a manner that refuses to succumb to pathos and exceeds in maintaining a low-key clarity.  The video acknowledges the difficulty in framing a movement that continues to signify many things to many people, not to mention a national story unfolding against a backdrop of extraordinary partisan politics in the United States. Open-ended questions of gender, collaboration, and the media take the place of graphic violence against Indigenous People or explicit environmental concerns. The artist seems to suggest that in our presently fractured social, political, and geographical landscape, the personal is more political than ever. “I hope that by displaying depth beyond the spectacle of  an audience that isn’t from or of these communities will recognize a place for empathy beyond horror and pity.”","Sky Hopinka work centers around personal positions of homeland and landscape, designs of language and facets of culture contained within, and the play between the accessibility of the known and the unknowable.",Dislocation Blues,Americas,"['protest.n.01', 'motion.n.03', 'medium.n.01', 'question.n.01', 'people.n.01', 'political.a.01', 'social.a.01', 'narrative.n.01', 'everyday.s.01 life.n.01', 'sky.n.01', 'backdrop.n.01', 'national.a.01', 'collaboration.n.01', 'dream.n.01', 'connection.n.01', 'water.n.01', 'rock.n.01', 'politics.n.01', 'audience.n.01', 'future.n.01', 'south.n.01', 'contemplation.n.02', 'attention.n.01', 'community.n.01', 'violence.n.01']","['protest.n.02', 'exploitation.n.01', 'colonialism.n.01', 'environmentalism.n.02', 'autochthonal.s.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_DislocationBlues.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_DislocationBlues-300x169.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/dislocation-blues/,"['Politics/8.058782986878962', 'Society/7.559565580618211', 'Cultural/3.201307189542484']","['Politics', 'Society', 'Cultural']",18.819655757039655,"['Activism/2.8745098039215686', 'Colonization/2.7777777777777777', 'Inequality/2.7092731829573933']","['Activism', 'Colonization', 'Inequality']",8.361560764656739,"['Material_Physical/26.421855921855933', 'Cultural/17.96698328331456', 'Society/16.21171442936149']","['Material_Physical', 'Cultural', 'Society']",60.60055363453198,"['Time/8.079365079365079', 'Space/7.9461538461538455', 'Land/7.310866910866911']","['Time', 'Space', 'Land']",23.336385836385833,0.6666666666666666,0.0
Chitra Ganesh,"Art of War 1, City in Broad Daylight, Leaving the House, Justice is a Virtue, and Lions are Stronger than Men are linocut prints from the series Sultana’s Dream. This series by Chitra Ganesh comprises a large-scale narrative suite inspired by a 1905 feminist utopian (eponymous) text written by a Bengali writer and social reformer, Rokeya Sakhhawat Hossain. Educated thanks to the support of her elite family, Hossain was one of the few Bengali women of her generation writing in English. The text “Sultana’s Dream,” though not as well known, holds a singular position among early feminist science fiction.   This series of linocut prints draws on Hossain’s text and connects with problems shaping 21st-century life: apocalyptic environmental disaster, the disturbing persistence of gender-based inequality, the power of the wealthy few against the economic struggles of the majority, and ongoing geopolitical conflicts that cause widespread death and suffering. Protests scenes, revisited myths, or dreams, the linocut scenes all illustrate an alternative future in which gender roles in India are reversed and women occupy broad-ranging positions of power. These works demonstrate the enduring relevance of utopian imaginaries in offering means of envisioning a more just future.","Spanning printmaking, sculpture, and video, Chitra Ganesh’s work draws from broad-ranging material and historic reference points, including surrealism, expressionism, Hindu, Greek and Buddhist iconographies, South Asian pictorial traditions, 19th-century European portraiture and fairy tales, comic books, song lyrics, science fiction, Bollywood posters, news and media images. The process of automatic writing is central to the practice of the Indian-American artist and emerges from dissecting myths to retrieve critical moments of abjection, desire, and loss. By layering disparate materials and visual languages, Ganesh considers alternate narratives of sexuality and power.",Sultana's Dream,Americas,"['dream.n.01', 'print.n.01', 'position.n.01', 'future.n.01', 'woman.n.01', 'power.n.01', 'protest.n.01', 'series.n.01', 'struggle.n.01', 'coevals.n.01', 'writer.n.01', 'write.v.01', 'fiction.n.01', 'economic.a.01', 'house.n.01', 'death.n.01', 'inspire.v.01', 'narrative.s.01', 'function.n.03', 'family.n.01', 'war.n.01', 'city.n.01', 'scene.n.01', 'social.a.01', 'life.n.01']","['feminist_movement.n.01', 'linocut.n.01', 'apocalypse.n.01', 'protest.n.02', 'myth.n.01', 'dream.n.01', 'utopianism.n.01', 'sex.n.04', 'india.n.01', 'woman.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/CG_SultanasDream5_JusticeisVirtue.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/CG_SultanasDream5_JusticeisVirtue-242x300.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/sultanas-dream/,"['Cultural/8.363132094943241', 'Politics/3.7495098039215686', 'Individual_Personal/3.0']","['Cultural', 'Politics', 'Individual_Personal']",15.11264189886481,"['Fantasy/5.077614379084968', 'Arts/3.285517715858273', 'Activism/2.8745098039215686']","['Fantasy', 'Arts', 'Activism']",11.23764189886481,"['Material_Physical/20.573432449903045', 'Society/19.12003878474467', 'Cultural/12.806221719457014']","['Material_Physical', 'Society', 'Cultural']",52.49969295410473,"['Land/8.765862242332831', 'Urbanization/6.990837104072398', 'Fantasy/5.491666666666667']","['Land', 'Urbanization', 'Fantasy']",21.248366013071895,0.3333333333333333,0.3333333333333333
Gauri Gill,"Acts of Appearance is an ongoing series by Gauri Gill consisting of lush, large-scale color portraits of the residents of a village in Maharashtra, in Western India, which is known for making Adivasi masks. Adivasi people are part of the tribal groups population of South Asia. Instead of requesting the likenesses of gods and demons, Gill asked the residents—including the master mask-makers Subhas and Bhagavan Dharam Kadu, their families, and fellow volunteers—to make masks that portray their own lives. Instead of consecrating gods or demons as per local tradition and lore, the masks become self-portraits and exercises in the symbolic representation of lived reality, across dreaming and waking states.  Then, she painstakingly orchestrated medium-format portraits of the makers wearing their masks in everyday settings, such as in Untitled, (16) and (32). Without uttering a word, the resulting images unfurl narratives that become vast commentaries on time, leisure, work, pleasure, hopes, dreams, fears, and futures. Gill’s photographs occupy the same threshold between human and spirit as the Boas photographs enacting the dance of Hamatsa (a Pacific Northwest Coast Indigenous community), and depict the frozen moment of an elaborate performance to be a powerful—and politically consequential—thing indeed.","Gauri Gill is interested in the social contract of photography. Her photographs propagate expression to subaltern existences within rural Indian states, even as they critically denote a fundamental imbalance in their own existence, at once accredited to Gill as well as the cultural, social, and political statements of the collaborators that she photographs. Her practice operates on a surface level that opens up onto an ephemeral, vital set of relationships, both through and beyond her social engagement with the communities, individuals, and practices that drive her photography to hold much more than what it directly portrays. In doing so, her works inquire about the circulation of expression from the margins of contemporary life, Gill’s work forms an estuary of repressed voices that leaks outward into the discourse of the greater art world. The Western structure of the singular artist as genius disintegrates against these somewhat anonymized, though strident sources. The sense that there is an expanded, unwieldy network of individuals at play throughout her works is present in their sometimes overflowing serial quality: almost all of her series are ongoing, and overlap each other.",Acts of Appearance,Asia,"['mask.n.01', 'portrayal.n.01', 'dance.n.01', 'population.n.01', 'spirit.n.01', 'ongoing.s.01', 'fear.n.01', 'setting.n.01', 'western.a.01', 'picture.v.02', 'dream.n.01', 'appearance.n.01', 'local.a.01', 'symbolic.a.01', 'future.n.01', 'south.n.01', 'community.n.01', 'tradition.n.01', 'color.n.01', 'everyday.s.01', 'family.n.01', 'moment.n.01', 'representation.n.01', 'performance.n.01', 'world.n.03']","['mask.n.01', 'tribal.a.01', 'custom.n.02', 'lore.n.01', 'self-portrait.n.01', 'narrative.s.01', 'labor.n.02', 'leisure.n.02']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Untitled-32-from-the-series-Acts-of-Appearance-2015-ongoing.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Untitled-32-from-the-series-Acts-of-Appearance-2015-ongoing-300x200.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/acts-of-appearance/,"['Individual_Personal/11.911355311355317', 'Cultural/6.572649572649572', 'Society/2.6333333333333333']","['Individual_Personal', 'Cultural', 'Society']",21.117338217338222,"['Mind/5.574358974358974', 'Culture/3.4230769230769234', 'Media/2.3803418803418803']","['Mind', 'Culture', 'Media']",11.377777777777778,"['Individual_Personal/40.50689310689312', 'Material_Physical/24.67713136536667', 'Cultural/22.498146951088128']","['Individual_Personal', 'Material_Physical', 'Cultural']",87.68217142334792,"['Mind/12.241025641025642', 'Land/12.023285211520507', 'Emotion/10.543223443223445']","['Mind', 'Land', 'Emotion']",34.80753429576959,0.6666666666666666,0.3333333333333333
Hulda Guzmán,"In The Nightmare, from the series Be Kind to Your Demons, Hulda Guzmán presents a number of scenes in which female characters carry out mundane activities in the company of secondary characters (mostly men) and devil-like creatures. Like a large part of her work, Be Kind to Your Demons is an invitation to embrace the devil in each of us, to surrender to bodily and external pleasures and to engage in a conscious dialogue with our own existence. Guzmán’s paintings are a reminder of the brevity, potential intensity, and frailty of human existence.","With a background in mural painting and photography, Hulda Guzmán is a Dominican artist whose paintings blend what could be identified as painterly magical realism, attention for the supernatural and extra sensorial, as well as for the pleasures of earthly existence set in the context of tropical landscapes or modernist architectures. Her delicate use of gouache and ink on wood and sophisticated compositions portray scenes that speak both of a Dominican and Caribbean identity and of a personal and sometimes intimate view of the world.  Often self-referential, her works are colorful, mystical and ecstatic, depicting intimate or public, celebratory and sensual –if not directly sexual– scenes, encounters or gatherings which feed from her upbringing in a liberal context. Untitled from 2011, one of her best-known works, presents a multi-sexual orgy in a lush pond and under a dramatic dusk skyscape while a group of viewers casually drink away. Her seductive scenes often include herself, her partners and friends, and members of the Dominican artists community.  Drawing from surrealism, Mexican muralism and Caribbean folk traditions, Guzman’s painting is an eloquent representation of her rich inner world. One in which moral schemes and rigid notions of good and bad are evaded. Like other Dominican artists, her work is determined by the insularity of the country, by its crafts tradition and by the sea while skeptically incorporating –both reaffirming and questioning– tropes associated to the Caribbean such as hot weather, an inclination to festivity and the amalgamation of religious traditions.","The Nightmare, from the series Be Kind to Your Demons",Americas,"['being.n.01', 'fictional_character.n.01', 'potential.a.01', 'female.a.01', 'dialogue.n.01', 'company.n.01', 'activity.n.01', 'animal.n.01', 'everyday.s.01', 'human.a.01', 'scene.n.01', 'series.n.01']","['devil.n.02', 'woman.n.01', 'painting.n.01', 'devil.n.02', 'domestic.a.03']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Hulda-Guzman-The-Nightmare.png,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Hulda-Guzman-The-Nightmare-292x300.png,https://kadist.org/work/the-nightmare-from-be-kind-to-your-demons-series/,"['Cultural/5.254084967320261', 'Material_Physical/3.672514619883041', 'Individual_Personal/2.5555555555555554']","['Cultural', 'Material_Physical', 'Individual_Personal']",11.482155142758858,"['Arts/4.476307189542483', 'Land/2.7251461988304095', 'Spirituality/1.5555555555555556']","['Arts', 'Land', 'Spirituality']",8.757008943928449,"['Cultural/21.35616066939597', 'Society/16.556410256410263', 'Individual_Personal/15.091125867596459']","['Cultural', 'Society', 'Individual_Personal']",53.003696793402696,"['Spirituality/8.473437673437672', 'Arts/7.2835164835164825', 'Power/5.630769230769231']","['Spirituality', 'Arts', 'Power']",21.387723387723387,0.6666666666666666,0.6666666666666666
Fredi Casco,"Pascua Dolorosa is a series of drawings made on old worksheets documenting land surfaces in Caapucú, a forest exploitation area where one of the most violent episodes of the repression of Stroessner’s dictatorship took place in 1976, and during which peasants accused of belonging to insurgent movements were kidnapped, tortured and many of them killed. In 2009, human bone remains were found in the Caapucú region during ground measurement work. Fredi Casco’s works reveal the tension between a cold and positivistic approach to landscape as put on record in the legal papers, the poignant use of violence as inscribed into the land, and a ghostly invocation of the power of resistance.","Working with a variety of media such as drawing, painting and photography Fredi Casco frequently incorporates original documents and archives as a medium and support of his work in order to bring to light specific episodes of Paraguayan political history, particularly events that took place during the time of Alfredo Stroessner’s long dictatorship (1954 to 1989). By using found photographs and legal papers, and incorporating visual references to indigenous cultural practices that were frequently obliterated as “collateral damage” of the geographical expansion of the Cold War into Latin American territories, his practice imbues with poetry the sordid historical narratives of his native Paraguay, making the significance of the work atemporal and extensive to other regions in the continent that share a comparable political history.",Pascua Dolorosa (Painful Easter),Americas,"['land.n.01', 'episode.n.01', 'record.n.01', 'region.n.01', 'uncover.v.01', 'land.n.04', 'resistance.n.01', 'approach.n.01', 'tension.n.01', 'document.n.01', 'violence.n.01', 'surface.n.01', 'power.n.01', 'motion.n.03', 'drawing.n.01', 'human.a.01', 'series.n.01']","['dictatorship.n.01', 'testimony.n.03', 'death.n.01', 'history.n.01', 'kidnap.v.01', 'archival.a.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/pascuadolorosa5.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/pascuadolorosa5-300x212.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/pascua-dolorosa-painful-easter/,"['Material_Physical/3.4013986013986015', 'Society/2.569230769230769', 'Individual_Personal/1.8333333333333335']","['Material_Physical', 'Society', 'Individual_Personal']",7.8039627039627035,"['Time/2.6321678321678323', 'Politics/1.7692307692307692', 'Body/1.0']","['Time', 'Politics', 'Body']",5.4013986013986015,"['Cultural/17.633888643176576', 'Material_Physical/16.96818736818737', 'Politics/14.25105025693261']","['Cultural', 'Material_Physical', 'Politics']",48.853126268296556,"['Arts/5.816239316239316', 'Power/5.111655011655012', 'Time/5.050183150183149']","['Arts', 'Power', 'Time']",15.978077478077477,0.3333333333333333,0.3333333333333333
Jorge González,"Easy to fold and carry, Jorge González’s stools embody the nomadic and flexible nature of the Escuela de Oficios. González’s work employs a modernist language while paying homage to artisanal techniques specific to Puerto Rico and the Indigenous knowledge, people and histories of the Carribean. Reinterpreting the furniture line ArKlu (1945-1948) conceived by the architects Stephen Arneson and Henry Klumb, the stools were conceived in collaboration with various artisans in Puerto Rico–Eustaquio Alers, a weaver from Aguadilla, Joe Hernández from Ciales, and MAOF from San Juan, a contemporary wood-salvaging collective, among others. The seats are inspired by the furniture line ArKlu (1945-1948) conceived by the architects Stephen Arneson and Henry Klumb, whose practice encouraged ethical design principles, and named in honor of the craft-working Chévere family the artist met during a research trip in Puerto Rico and who descends from the Taíno, an Indigenous people of the Caribbean thought to have been eradicated during the Spanish conquest. In the Caribbean, the Spanish word chévere loosely translates as “more than cool” in English and evokes both a culture and a state of being.","Layering references from ancient and modern influences, Jorge González’s work revolves around reestablishing lost artistic techniques of the Caribbean and in particular Puerto Rico. His socially-engaged practice finds its manifestation in collaboration with various artisans and in-depth research of lost trades related to arts and crafts.

Adriana Martínez,"Her work Al final del arcoiris (At the end of the rainbow, 2015) is a bundle of bills from Chile, Venezuela, Brazil, Colombia, Nicaragua, and Costa Rica, arranged by color to form a tight spiraling rainbow held close with a rubber band. Here, Martinez uses these various currencies to gesture towards questions of capital and value, the accumulation of wealth, and regional economies. Beneath the surface of her playful visual propositions, Martinez asks us to consider not only the monetary costs of international goods, but also the real, human consequences of a global economic culture that privileges some and devastates others.","Adriana Martínez is obsessed with ideas and entities that extend past national and regional borders. Martinez makes work that wrestles with the global economy through simple gestures conceived with a lightness of hand. Thought of temporally, many of her artworks can be described as quick: easily read, they come across like nimble jabs, the most succinct and articulate rebuttals. Martínez is conceptual in her approach to making art, often writing out her ideas in lieu of the traditional artist sketch. She is not concerned with the traditional skills required to realize her works—those, like the commodities she often works with, are easily traded—but is more interested in the process of imagining and articulating a certain point of view. She works with everyday and readymade objects often, pulling from the mass market and our image-rich global culture to comment on the very proliferation of those images (and the materials and peoples that they stand in for) around the world.",Al final del arco iris,Americas,"['playful.a.01', 'form.v.01', 'concluding.s.01', 'economy.n.01', 'global.s.01', 'economic.a.01', 'color.n.01', 'real.a.01', 'surface.n.01', 'consequence.n.01', 'ocular.a.02', 'human.a.01', 'question.n.01', 'culture.n.01']","['money.n.01', 'value.n.01', 'capitalism.n.01', 'economy.n.01', 'inequality.n.01', 'class_struggle.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_ADRIANA-MARTINEZ-AL-FINAL-DEL-ARCOIRIS-1-WEB.jpeg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_ADRIANA-MARTINEZ-AL-FINAL-DEL-ARCOIRIS-1-WEB-300x200.jpeg,https://kadist.org/work/al-final-del-arco-iris/,"['Society/7.24423076923077', 'Politics/4.641666666666667', 'Material_Physical/1.5692307692307694']","['Society', 'Politics', 'Material_Physical']",13.455128205128206,"['Economy/5.435897435897436', 'Inequality/2.8333333333333335', 'Power/1.8083333333333333']","['Economy', 'Inequality', 'Power']",10.077564102564104,"['Society/7.421911421911422', 'Cultural/6.217948717948718', 'Material_Physical/3.542424242424243']","['Society', 'Cultural', 'Material_Physical']",17.182284382284383,"['Economy/4.9743589743589745', 'Arts/2.371794871794872', 'Design/2.307692307692308']","['Economy', 'Arts', 'Design']",9.653846153846155,0.6666666666666666,0.3333333333333333

Collier Schorr,"Collier Schorr’s prints upend conventions of portrait photography by challenging what it means to “document” a subject. American Flag (Scratch) (1999), for example, depicts an unidentified male subject clad in an American flag-print singlet. With his head and extremities out of frame, the camera focuses on his flush-red torso, his left nipple protruding from the singlet’s strap. A horizontal scratch cuts across his right pectoral muscle, bleeding at its end and nearly dripping on the uppermost stripe of the flag print fabric. The scene’s context is ambiguous, and it is never clear if Schorr’s subject is entering a match or leaving it. By stripping the image of those anterior narratives, Schorr allows the viewer to fully revel in the image’s strange juxtapositions – of bloody injuries and healthy bodies, of patriotic symbols and exposed nipples – without resorting to narrative explication or symbolic interpretation.","Collier Schorr photographs communities of people, from high school wresters in her native New York to teenagers in the German countryside clad in American military uniforms. Her work displays an almost anthropological curiosity, and in documenting her subjects, she tries to find the idiosyncratic details through which people organize into “tribal” relationships with one another. Her images, by extension, blend photographic realism with elements of fiction and fantasy as a means of representing the various ways these tribes identify themselves. Schoor’s work also investigates gender and the ways in which subjects use visual cues and embodied signs to both inhabit and subvert assumed gender expectations.",American Flag (Scratch),Americas,"['flag.n.01', 'american.a.01', 'subject.n.01', 'injury.n.01', 'strange.a.01', 'capable.s.02', 'head.n.01', 'print.n.01', 'fabric.n.01', 'symbolic.a.01', 'interpretation.n.01', 'symbol.n.01', 'narrative.s.01', 'frame.n.01', 'photography.n.01', 'image.n.01', 'portrayal.n.01', 'context.n.01', 'camera.n.01', 'scene.n.01', 'spectator.n.01', 'body.n.01', 'narrative.n.01']","['portrait.n.02', 'photography.n.01', 'symbolism.n.01', 'patriotic.a.01', 'identity.n.02', 'violence.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_Collier-Schorr_American-Flag-Scratch-WEB.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_Collier-Schorr_American-Flag-Scratch-WEB-198x300.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/american-flag-scratch/,"['Cultural/3.548675610595115', 'Individual_Personal/2.675', 'Politics/2.541176470588235']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Politics']",8.76485208118335,"['Arts/2.725146198830409', 'Violence/1.9411764705882353', 'Activism/1.7411764705882353']","['Arts', 'Violence', 'Activism']",6.4074991400068795,"['Cultural/19.97761317629739', 'Material_Physical/17.068218056453357', 'Individual_Personal/10.716830537883169']","['Cultural', 'Material_Physical', 'Individual_Personal']",47.76266177063391,"['Space/8.026826115061409', 'Mind/4.791208791208791', 'Culture/4.615384615384616']","['Space', 'Mind', 'Culture']",17.433419521654816,0.6666666666666666,0.0
Emily Mast,"Like several of Mast’s works, B!RDBRA!N (Addendum) is the result of the accumulation of details from the various chapters and formats of an evolving project. The work is comprised by a sculptural set, a text piece that originates from an instructional score, and footage filmed during rehearsals for B!RDBRA!N, a play that was first performed in theaters in Los Angeles.   Originally conceived of as a live response to the legacy of the historical French artist Guy de Cointet, Mast set out to investigate and interrogate Cointet’s work while incorporating the true story of Alex, an African Gray parrot who was the subject of a thirty-year avian language experiment. What interested her was the overlap in the ways that both the artist and the experiment dealt with the imprecision of language and the many ways it can be delivered and understood. For the play she cast a stuntman, a stutterer, a sign-language interpreter, a comedian, a child, an auctioneer, and a theater director, as a way to explore channels of communication in which language is problematic, challenging and/or inappropriate. They perform within a landscape of vivid, colorful forms that are reminiscent of de Cointet’s sets, elementary school classrooms, and minimalist art.","Emily Mast works in the intersection between performance, visual arts, poetry, and theatre. With a keen interest in the world of semiotics, her work often combines signs, symbols, and disciplines in order to deconstruct the conventions governing language and expose their limitations. Her works often have more than one iteration or morph over time: a live performance in a sculptural set might evolve into a film, and later projected onto a slightly different context. With each new version of the work, a varying yet related pathway opens up, allowing her to build up layers of semiotic explorations.   In her work Ashes In I’s, for example, through a series of structured notations and improvisation, Mast instructs a chorus of 18 people to perform a piece that incorporates concepts of theater, neuroscience, and social psychology. In the resulting performance, singers alternate between laughter and sad, weeping sounds, evoking concepts such as physical and emotional contagion, crowd behavior, and mob psychology. In another work, The Stage is a Cage, Mast collaborates with a professional dancer to explore aspects of animal impulses, the animal body, and the various ways in which messages can be transmitted without words.  As Mast overlays different systems of communication—including sculptural sets, photographs, scores, meditations, formal gestures, the body, movement, light—what results is a surplus of accumulated messages transmitted or lost in translation between the myriad forms. At their core they are a meditation on the material dimension of language, the shades of human comprehension or the lack thereof.",B!RDBRA!N (Addendum),Americas,"['theater.n.01', 'language.n.01', 'play.n.01', 'set.n.01', 'african.a.01', 'french.a.01', 'mark.n.01', 'los_angeles.n.01', 'perform.v.01', 'research.v.02', 'school.n.01', 'format.n.01', 'footage.n.01', 'sculptural.a.01', 'details.n.01', 'child.n.01', 'consequence.n.01', 'historical.a.01', 'subject.n.01', 'undertaking.n.01', 'landscape.n.01', 'piece.n.01', 'narrative.n.01', 'form.n.01']","['semiotics.n.01', 'language.n.01', 'cognition.n.01', 'communication.n.01', 'dramaturgy.n.01', 'impreciseness.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_Photo-by-Betsy-Lin-Seder-WEB.jpeg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_Photo-by-Betsy-Lin-Seder-WEB-300x188.jpeg,https://kadist.org/work/brdbran-addendum/,"['Cultural/21.74676434676435', 'Individual_Personal/9.197888386123681', 'Politics/8.546606334841629']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Politics']",39.49125906772966,"['Language/6.589743589743591', 'Mind/6.0666666666666655', 'Media/4.883516483516483']","['Language', 'Mind', 'Media']",17.53992673992674,"['Cultural/12.921848576260341', 'Society/10.17486504723347', 'Individual_Personal/7.2113360323886635']","['Cultural', 'Society', 'Individual_Personal']",30.308049655882478,"['Urbanization/4.36140350877193', 'Arts/4.354638009049774', 'Fantasy/2.709090909090909']","['Urbanization', 'Arts', 'Fantasy']",11.425132426912613,0.6666666666666666,0.0
Orion Shepherd,"Ballad of the Unabomber Part I is a painting by Orion Shepherd that features several manila folders stacked in order according to their size, resting atop a grainy hardwood pattern. The painting refers to Theodore John Kaczynski, most commonly known as the Unabomber, and depicts the seemingly innocuous manila envelopes, which through his hands became fatal explosive weapons. Despite the deplorable actions that earned Kaczynski a life sentence, the manifesto that he demanded to be published has been regarded by many as a sane and highly intelligent work, correct in several of his ideas. At the core, Kaczynski’s message was to retreat back to nature and wildlife, and Shepherd’s work considers these threads: how a man of clear intelligence and a deep appreciation for the natural world was able to enact such atrocities against other human beings. The depiction of the folders over a wooden background continues Shepherd’s interest in everyday, mundane objects and their limitless potential to enact the good as well as the deplorable through our hands.","Orion Shepherd is a Los Angeles based artist working across drawing, collage, painting and sculpture. From an early age he was interested in musical and artistic subcultures—DIY, hardcore, punk, graffiti and surf culture among them—and was influenced by both outsider figures like artist and graffiti writer Ruby Neri and surf artist Steve Baldi, as well as by major artists such as Vija Celmins whose work is similarly of an observational nature.

James Weeks,,"James Weeks, born in 1922, was an important figure in the Bay Area figurative painter tradition, with contemporaries such as Richard Diebenkorn, Elmer Bischoff, and David Park. Diverging from the placid sunny landscapes and non-objective abstract painting that characterized Bay Area painting of the time, Weeks instead chose to depict aspects of American life in a different light. Jazz musicians, cloudy nightclubs, and sailing races filled Weeks monumental canvases, forever freezing these action-filled moments in paint.

Cheryl Donegan,"Fashion is the focus of Blood Sugar, which consists of a video projected onto a vintage vinyl jacket set at torso height on a dressmaker’s dummy. As suggested by the work’s title, Cheryl Donegan uses the body as a metaphor, relating the continuous cycle and recycle of images that characterizes consumer fashion culture to the flow of sugar in our blood. Formally, the work borrows strategies from conceptual art, and specifically video art from the 1960s and 1970s—such as the use of repetition, patterns, found materials, and a DIY, low-tech aesthetic—and combines it with contemporary cultural forms, in this case, the world of fashion.  In the video, as runway models emerge and recede into darkness, digitally inserted images of fabric patterns appear, hover across the screen and dissipate to the sound of a repetitive beat. As the video progresses, footage of a child wearing aluminum foil as clothes and another scene with a group of women wearing ornate dresses is overlaid with a collage of images of consumer objects and commercial spaces. The result is a an meditation on fashion’s most essential elements: fabric, the body and the mediated image.","Cheryl Donegan is best known for her performance and video works that deal primarily with ideas of sex, gender, and the ways in which the female body is represented both in art and more broadly across popular culture. During the 1990s, Donegan’s practice was influenced by of a range of movements that brought into question aspects of feminism, identity politics and politically engaged art—the underground feminist hardcore punk movement Riot Girl, and the grunge, slacker, and DIY cultures among them.  Donegan often uses her body as an apparatus for mark making, incorporating performative actions that are captured by the camera and that result in or relate to process paintings and drawings. Combining these bodily gestures with found consumer objects and imagery, her works interrogate the conventions of different forms of popular culture such as music videos and advertising, while at the same time considering the politics of self-representation.  Most recently, she has continued her exploration of the mediated image, mark marking and its relationship to the body through a series of paintings and sculptures, as well as videos distributed on social media.",Blood Sugar,Americas,"['manner.n.01', 'form.n.03', 'video.n.01', 'body.n.01', 'image.n.01', 'dark.n.01', 'scheme.n.01', 'conceptual.s.01', 'repeat.n.01', 'put.v.01', 'footage.n.01', 'fabric.n.01', 'model.n.01', 'metaphor.n.01', 'screen.n.01', 'collage.n.01', 'child.n.01', 'sound.n.01', 'elements.n.01', 'consequence.n.01', 'woman.n.01', 'contemporary.s.01', 'cultural.a.01', 'culture.n.01', 'title.n.01']","['fashion.n.03', 'consumerism.n.01', 'body.n.01', 'design.n.04', 'picture.n.01', 'aesthetic.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_BLOOD_SUGAR_ED1_alternative_dressform-WEB.png,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_BLOOD_SUGAR_ED1_alternative_dressform-WEB-200x300.png,https://kadist.org/work/blood-sugar/,"['Cultural/10.469902792426012', 'Material_Physical/9.472027972027973', 'Individual_Personal/4.379084967320262']","['Cultural', 'Material_Physical', 'Individual_Personal']",24.321015731774246,"['Space/6.346153846153846', 'Design/5.361344537815126', 'Economy/2.6783216783216783']","['Space', 'Design', 'Economy']",14.38582006229065,"['Cultural/19.90928858722977', 'Material_Physical/16.602863802863805', 'Individual_Personal/11.718381927669855']","['Cultural', 'Material_Physical', 'Individual_Personal']",48.23053431776343,"['Mind/7.395604395604397', 'Space/6.346153846153846', 'Design/5.6867772750125685']","['Mind', 'Space', 'Design']",19.42853551677081,1.0,0.6666666666666666
Matthew Angelo Harrison,"In Bodily Study of Unthinking Groups, Harrison combines two disparate materials into one stratified stack: automotive clay (used in detailing cars) forms the earthy base, while fragments of zebra skull become imbedded in this falsified soil. Harrison’s forged archeological artifact compresses two cultural contexts together: that of Africa, represented by the bleached zebra skull; and that of Detroit, the birthplace of the American car.  Detroit’s Matthew Angelo Harrison works at the intersection of sculpture and technology, building his own 3D printers (which rise to the status of sculpture), and using these creations to formulate others. This fusion makes sense when you look at his biography: born in Detroit and trained in sculpture at the Art Institute of Chicago, Harrison also works, by day, at the Ford Motor Company, creating prototypes for the cars of the future. In his artistic practice, Harrison is interested in mining available—often commercialized—forms of African culture, looking at these artifacts from the point of view of an urban African American in the twenty-first century.","Detroit’s Matthew Angelo Harrison works at the intersection of sculpture and technology, building his own 3D printers (which rise to the status of sculpture), and using these creations to formulate others.

Jean-Luc Moulène,"It rains, Paris, 1st July 2000, which could be the refrain of a song, is the title of a photograph of a minimal moment, the vision of a Parisian pedestrian, a cut flower lying on the pavement covered in rain drops. Is this moment captured by chance or a mise en scène? There is a sort of hiatus in the image; the planes – motif and background – connect nature in full bloom, pure, fragile, ephemeral with the grey weighty tarmac. The calm of the raindrops in It rains, Paris, 1st July 2000 contrasts with the gushing in La Fontaine des Amoureux, Paris, 3 avril 2006. Contrary to Nœud coulant (also in the Kadist collection) that opens up possibilities for thought and research, the elements of this photograph are organized like a rhizome. The raindrops and the flower petals form a network of points which the spectator can mentally link and recompose. On one hand tightly knit, dispersed on the other. The motif tends to fuse with the background to create one unique plane. The image generally tends towards a certain flatness, rather like medieval tapestries in the Mille fleurs style or in fabrics with flowery prints. In the recent “Fleurs” series (2008), the artist photographed wild flowers, placing them in front of colored backgrounds that extract them from their natural pastoral setting.","After training in literature and working in advertising, Jean-Luc Moulène became known in the 1990s for his ‘documentary’ photographic practice. His images could be considered as studies of natural and cultural phenomena; the Objets de grève ( Strike objects) series (1999) documents objects made in factories during social protests. Moulène uses the codes of media images and diverts them to liberate the gaze and produce a new imaginary. This poetic tactic is manifest in the series called Disjonctions, in which Moulène photographs still lives, portraits, daily urban scenes. The notion of disjunction, which can be interpreted in the grammatical sense (‘or’, ‘either… either…’) or in terms of logic (an alternative in a dilemma), is manifest in the image by the disunity of the elements in the composition. The artist is not just a photographer, he increasingly creates relations with drawing, sculpture, objects, texts and newspapers. As a counterpoint, when asked what unites his work, the artist responds that: “An absurd evidence, a horrible revelation,a burst of laughter…” (Interview with Briony Fer, « Chaque quelconque », ibidem.) His works tend towards evocation rather than fixed meaning, inviting the spectators to invent their own tales in this “community of storytellers and translators” (Jacques Rancière, The Emancipated Spectator).","It rains, Paris, 1st July 2000",Europe,"['paris.n.01', 'background.n.01', 'airplane.n.01', 'motif.n.01', 'moment.n.01', 'song.n.01', 'ephemeral.s.01', 'opportunity.n.01', 'kind.n.01', 'form.v.01', 'setting.n.01', 'network.n.01', 'photograph.n.01', 'print.n.01', 'vision.n.01', 'fabric.n.01', 'possibility.n.01', 'natural.a.01', 'hand.n.01', 'elements.n.01', 'image.n.01', 'nature.n.01', 'manner.n.01', 'title.n.01', 'make.v.03']","['everyday.s.01', 'nature.n.03', 'ephemeron.n.01', 'fragility.n.01', 'photography.n.01', 'picture.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/img-19_0.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/img-19_0-226x300.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/it-rains-paris-1st-july-2000/,"['Material_Physical/6.3931623931623935', 'Cultural/6.2027605779153765', 'Individual_Personal/1.658119658119658']","['Material_Physical', 'Cultural', 'Individual_Personal']",14.254042629197427,"['Arts/3.6223684210526317', 'Space/2.6153846153846154', 'Environmental/1.7777777777777777']","['Arts', 'Space', 'Environmental']",8.015530814215026,"['Cultural/21.489013540638933', 'Individual_Personal/16.28140486964017', 'Material_Physical/9.886080586080586']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Material_Physical']",47.656498996359694,"['Design/8.29259574275054', 'Mind/6.484493284493285', 'Arts/5.046794871794872']","['Design', 'Mind', 'Arts']",19.823883899038698,1.0,0.3333333333333333
Melvin Moti,"“The Prisoner’s Cinema” is a phenomenon described in neurology as a hallucination, that appears after a prolonged absence of visual sensations. A blind screen of hallucinations forms itself on the eyes cut off from visual stimuli. The subject can see this projection, but fails to register these mental images, transforming it into an intimate and personal experience. In 1954, a scientist studied the syndrome of prisoners locked up in dark cells. This phenomenon is also common to truck drivers caught in a snowstorm. Melvin Moti is interested in the relationship between hallucination and formalism. Constant forms and geometric shapes appear on a recurring basis. A constant form is a form whose interpretation is not based on a cultural contingency, but that appears at different times and in different cultures, and forms no history and no future. The Prisoner’s Cinema consists of abstract images, rays of light through a window, and explanations of a scientist describing his vision after undergoing sensory deprivation for several days. This is about the origins of the film, creating an image of the power image of the subject, the unconscious, history of abstraction and formalism.","Scientific research, high and mass culture, and the processes of cultural production in contemporary society plays an important role in the work of Rotterdam-born artist Melvin Moti, currently based in Rotterdam and in Berlin. The artist whose practice traverses films, books, objects and drawing, enquires into the power of human imagination and abstraction, looking at how perception works neurologically and psychologically. His earlier works include a guided tour in the empty rooms of the Hermitage through memory (No Show, 2004), the human ability to make images appear on the retina from total darkness (The Prisoner’s Cinema, 2008) or the representation of the fourth dimension (The Eightfold Dot, 2013). The artist gives form to obscure anecdotes, incidents, and individuals — or, what he calls black holes — that he claims haven’t been contextualized by official history. Concerned with history and its influence in cultural production, Moti researched the Cosmists, an early twentieth century Russian group of thinkers responsible for Cosmism, the philosophical and cultural movement that combined occult and esoteric theories with space science. By comparing statistics, scientist and member of the Cosmists, Alexander Chizhevsky, discovered a correlation between solar activity (such as sunspots) and major historical events on earth (such as wars, revolutions, epidemics and natural disasters). In several studies Chizhevsky describes how one can observe an increase in wars, revolutions, and in epidemics on earth during years of high amounts of solar activity, while years with a low amount of solar activity correspond to a decrease of military and political events on earth. Chizevsky called this observed synchrony “historiometry”. While studying this history, Moti produced two works in 2015, a film Cosmism and a series of silk works, Cluster Illusion.",The Prisoner’s Cinema,Europe,"['film.n.02', 'phenomenon.n.01', 'changeless.s.02', 'form.n.01', 'subject.n.01', 'ocular.a.02', 'image.n.01', 'geometric.s.01', 'history.n.01', 'times.n.01', 'abstraction.n.01', 'projection.n.01', 'common.a.01', 'eyes.n.01', 'vision.n.01', 'future.n.01', 'interpretation.n.01', 'abstract.a.01', 'screen.n.01', 'personal.a.01', 'beginning.n.04', 'shape.n.01', 'light.n.01', 'establish.v.08', 'relationship.n.01']","['formalism.n.01', 'hallucination.n.01', 'sensory_deprivation.n.01', 'sight.n.03', 'darkness.n.02', 'unconscious_mind.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/img-500_0.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/img-500_0-300x204.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/the-prisoners-cinema/,"['Individual_Personal/10.75004456327986', 'Society/4.23184641445511', 'Politics/2.506469979296066']","['Individual_Personal', 'Society', 'Politics']",17.488360957031038,"['Mind/5.8750445632798565', 'Violence/2.4753246753246754', 'Inequality/1.631469979296066']","['Mind', 'Violence', 'Inequality']",9.981839217900598,"['Individual_Personal/21.886685699921', 'Cultural/19.72929864253394', 'Material_Physical/15.506771006771007']","['Individual_Personal', 'Cultural', 'Material_Physical']",57.12275534922594,"['Time/10.236075036075038', 'Mind/9.817912806148101', 'Media/7.491905480140773']","['Time', 'Mind', 'Media']",27.54589332236391,0.3333333333333333,0.3333333333333333
David Maljkovic,"This video was filmed in the middle of the Zagreb fair which took place in the 1960s and 1970s under the rule of Tito. Tito created the fair to signify the exemplary economic exchange between the East and West. The film’s setting takes place at the Italian pavilion, where several young people are seen sitting in cars, trying to repeat sentences in English. The Zagreb fair initiative may have seemed positive for the development of trade with the world and a brighter future beyond the borders of their country, however, the tone, the monotony and repetition, without conviction of the same phrases reveals the absurdity of the situation. Politically, Croatia, in this time was a candidate for Europe.  Economically the country has been in a long recession with an uncertain future for new generations. Time is suspended, the outlook has been blocked for an indefinable period.","David Maljkovic is one of the most important figures in the Eastern Europe scene. His works seek to represent collective memory as well as amnesia, analyzing the transition from communism to capitalism in the recent history of Croatia. It reconsiders abandoned and obsolete architecture that appears to have disappearread overnight. When monuments announce better futures, they are also act as testimonies of a certain melancholy, in a complex reality, full of contradictions.

Pierre Leguillon,"End of 2008, Pierre Leguillon presented at KADIST, Paris the first retrospective of the works of Diane Arbus (1923-1971) organized in France since 1980, bringing together all the images commissioned to the New York photographer by the Anglo-American press in the 1960s. This exhibition, destined to tour in various locations, presents the original pages of the magazines, including “Harper’s Bazaar”, “Esquire”, “Nova” and “The Sunday Times Magazine”. As Pierre Leguillon states: “The mythology surrounding Diane Arbus’ character is willingly set aside to offer a more neutral point of view on a more unfamiliar part of her work, although it was mass-distributed.” Many of the characters portrayed in these commissioned works seem less sensational at first glance than the “freaks” that made Diane Arbus’ work so famous, since the retrospective MOMA organized in 1973 in New York, two years after her suicide. And yet, “leafing through” all her contributions for the press, the Diane Arbus’ method, her installing the model in an environment in such a particular way, emerges obviously. Long sitting sessions, sometimes repeated, were destined to allow the model to “let go”, while then never stopped fixing the camera, straight forward. It is no doubt their rigorous construction that enables these images, still today, to be contemporary.","Pierre Leguillon is an artist who has developed projects as a curator and critic since the beginning of the 1990s, by creating a single page review, ‘Sommaire’ (35 issues between 1991 and 1996), then by collaborating to ‘Journal des Arts’, and ‘Art press’ (Special issue « Oublier l’exposition » in 2000), then to ‘Purple’ (column « Calme plat » about printed objects from 2002 to 2004).  In parallel, he has photographed many exhibitions, which he started reenacting in 1993 in slideshows, their content being each augmented and renewed for each session.

Jiri Kovanda,"Kovanda’s ‘discreet’ actions (leaving a discussion in a rush, bumping into passers-by in the street, making a pile of rubbish and scattering it, looking at the sun until tears come…) are always documented according to the same format: a piece of A4 paper, a concise typewritten text, and sometimes a photograph taken by someone else. This action, walking abnormally slowly, questions the place of the individual within the space of a city with regards to social habits. Kovanda places himself slightly outside the regulated rhythm of the city walking. “A [certain] reading consists in analyzing the artist’s micros-interventions which have taken place in the public sphere during the Soviet era in Prague specifically as political art which the artist refutes.” (extract from the journal Particules). Was he noticed as ‘suspect’? His footsteps mime prudence, as if there was a potential risk underfoot. The title describes and at the same time renders poetic the artist’s walk. Walking is equivalent to creating, according to Thierry Davila (Marcher, créer, éditions du Regard, 2007). A complex relation comes to be between the action, its documentation, and its audience, posing the question of their meaning. His works have been exhibited some thirty years after they took place for a ‘second audience’. “I think that the message I was sending out was not intended for the people who were present when the actions happened at the concrete moment when they were taking place. The message was intended more for those who would read about them as actions. What I was interested in was something ordinary, something normal, that might happen that way. That’s what they were all about. For me, they don’t have any symbolic meaning”, according to the artist.","Jiri Kovanda was born in 1953 in Prague, Czech Republic.

Julius Koller,"Wordplay was a central focus of Koller’s work, in particular the acronym U.F.O, which he adapted in his diagrammatic drawings to stand variously for Univerzálna Futurologická Organizácia (Universal Futurological Organization, 1972–3), Univerzálny Filozoficky Ornament (Universal Philosophical Ornament, 1978) or Underground Fantastic Organization (1975), and which also appeared in a series of slapsticky self-portraits titled ‘U.F.O.–naut’ (1970–2007). These infinite variations on a common cipher constituted an insistent incantation of the Utopian principle. Friedrich Nietzsche argued that to realize a fundamental critique of ‘bad faith’ means to move beyond cynicism and embrace a radical optimism that exceeds the petty dialectics of expectation and disappointment. In his approach to life and art as the U.F.O.–naut, Koller embodied precisely this: he actualized the potential of his imagination as a form of existential agency. As we get entangled in the strange possibilities of art and ideas, we all become U.F.O.–nauts and are deeply indebted to Koller, our patron saint of U.F.O.–nauts.","In its stringency, obsession and peculiarity, the oeuvre of Julius Koller is one of the most idiosyncratic and consistent in European art since the 1960s. Yet Koller is not only a seminal figure in the history of the neo- and post-avant-garde; his work has long been a critical inspiration for artists and intellectuals. In the most recent past, Koller’s concepts of the Anti-Happening, the Anti-Picture, the Universal-cultural Futurological Operation (U.F.O.), his actions, objects, texts and the enormous referential archive he built up, have attracted growing interest on the part of a broader art public.  From around 1960, in response to the modernist mainstream in Slovak art, Julius Koller began to develop his aesthetic position of the “antihappening.” His strategy consists in using real objects and everyday life as the predefined program for an aesthetic operation: from 1965, in texts rubberstamped on paper that refer to the context of the “anti-happening,” and then in 1967/1968 in pictures for which Koller used white latex paint instead of oils and which saw the first appearance of the question mark—the symbol of Koller’s brands of naming, or “making known,” that was later to undergo many mutations in various media and states of aggregation. The “invitation cards for an idea”—as Koller called the text works relating to the “anti-happenings”—and the palimpsests and serial arrangements of the “anti-pictures” set themselves apart from the academicism of Modernism in more than just formal terms. Koller foregoes every form of technical mastery. The “anti-pictures” are amateurish in style, ensuring that they fulfill their task, defined by Koller as “engaging rather than arranging.”Julius Koller was born in 1939 in Piestany, Slovakia. He died in 2007 in Bratislava.","Demonstrative Cultural  Situation 1,2 (U.F.O.)",Europe,"['cardinal.s.01', 'strange.a.01', 'imagination.n.01', 'common.a.01', 'approach.n.01', 'possibility.n.01', 'idea.n.01', 'drawing.n.01', 'life.n.01', 'form.n.01', 'series.n.01']","['pun.n.01', 'fantasy.n.01', 'construction.n.03', 'future.n.01', 'fiction.n.01', 'unidentified_flying_object.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/demonstrative_cultural_situation_1low_0.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/demonstrative_cultural_situation_1low_0-300x222.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/demonstrative-cultural-situation-12-u-f-o/,"['Cultural/12.22288838612368', 'Individual_Personal/7.716503267973856', 'Material_Physical/5.890196078431372']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Material_Physical']",25.829587732528907,"['Fantasy/9.915196078431373', 'Time/4.3124183006535945', 'Mind/3.4611111111111112']","['Fantasy', 'Time', 'Mind']",17.68872549019608,"['Individual_Personal/23.36684981684982', 'Cultural/11.157154103206736', 'Material_Physical/4.79788838612368']","['Individual_Personal', 'Cultural', 'Material_Physical']",39.32189230618024,"['Mind/8.574358974358974', 'Values/5.92967032967033', 'Spirituality/5.721794871794872']","['Mind', 'Values', 'Spirituality']",20.225824175824176,1.0,0.3333333333333333
Mario Garcia Torres,"Mario Garcia Torres discovered the work of artist Oscar Neuestern in an article published in ARTnews in 1969. This article, which is the only trace of his work, is indicative of a lack of interest by Neuestern to leave his name in history; to “defend an artistic activity that has little or no interest to last.” Oscar Neuestern could only remember the previous 24 hours, of which his life and his work are in constant erasure and reconstruction. His practice was “to let things be done with time and the unconscious,” while “not fearing the void.” He looked for the absolute through transparency and symmetry. Neuestern thought to reach this absolute through an ultimate “non-act,” in other words to create from scratch. In a form without image, the artist tells the story of this artist in a series of slides that change from white to black, while also playing with the opacity and transparency of the slides. The Transparencies of the Non-act is a silent visual work and it questions, through the history of Neuestern, artwork, creation, the role of the artist, and the building of history.","With the care and seriousness of an art historian, Mario Garcia Torres creatively composes with immateriality and his discovery of conceptual practices dating back to the 1960s. His playful work infuses new meanings and continuity into art and some of its lesser known stories. To date artists like Michael Asher, Robert Barry, Alighiero Boetti, Martin Kippenberger have for instance been inspirations for various interventions by Garcia Torres, thus prolonging, and simultaneously slightly modifying, their contexts in present and future times. Photographs, slide shows, video, music, publications allow him to discreetly revisit narratives and myths, either by quoting facts or by inventing tangents.

Claire Fontaine,"Foreigners Everywhere is a series of neon signs in several different languages. Named for Stranieri Ovunque, an anarchist collective from Turin, the work embodies and projects the ambivalence of their name into various sites and contexts. Lacking context, the neon suggests a factual statement, xenophobic threat, and evokes the estrangement of feeling foreign in a global society, a circumstance legible by the targeted populations.","Claire Fontaine is a Paris-based collective, founded in 2004. After lifting her name from a popular brand of school notebooks, Claire Fontaine declared herself a “readymade artist” and began to elaborate a version of neo-conceptual art that often looks like other people’s work. Working in neon, video, sculpture, painting and text, her practice can be described as an ongoing interrogation of the political impotence and the crisis of singularity that seem to define contemporary art today. But if the artist herself is the subjective equivalent of a urinal or a Brillo box – as displaced, deprived of its use value, and exchangeable as the products she makes – there is always the possibility of what she calls the “human strike.” Only two years old, Claire Fontaine uses her freshness and youth to make herself a whatever-singularity and a existential terrorist in search of subjective emancipation. She grows up among the ruins of the notion of authorship, experimenting with collective protocols of production, détournements, and the production of various devices for the sharing of intellectual and private property",Foreigners Everywhere (Italian),Europe,"['context.n.01', 'statement.n.01', 'population.n.01', 'global.s.01', 'sign.n.01', 'name.v.01', 'language.n.01', 'society.n.01', 'undertaking.n.01', 'series.n.01']","['language.n.01', 'alienation.n.01', 'authorship.n.02', 'struggle.n.03', 'anarchism.n.01', 'neon.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/img-330.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/img-330-300x129.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/foreigners-everywhere-italian/,"['Individual_Personal/6.217948717948718', 'Society/5.811735649970944', 'Politics/3.5']","['Individual_Personal', 'Society', 'Politics']",15.529684367919662,"['Emotion/6.217948717948718', 'Politics/3.5', 'Economy/2.587418300653595']","['Emotion', 'Politics', 'Economy']",12.305367018602315,"['Cultural/8.467210567210568', 'Politics/5.777777777777778', 'Individual_Personal/4.780566801619433']","['Cultural', 'Politics', 'Individual_Personal']",19.02555514660778,"['Language/3.4914529914529915', 'Fantasy/3.375757575757576', 'Politics/3.177777777777778']","['Language', 'Fantasy', 'Politics']",10.044988344988345,0.6666666666666666,0.3333333333333333
Philip-Lorca diCorcia,"For this series, Philip-Lorca diCorcia walked along Santa Monica Boulevard in Los Angeles in search of models who would be prepared to pose in hotel rooms according to pre- planned scenarios. The artist explained that: “I went back to the street just like the ordinary clients of these prostitutes. I went up to them and mentioned the following: ‘I would like to take a photo of you, I will pay you exactly what you are paid for a pass’”. Gerald Hughes (a.k.a. Savage Fantasy); about 25 years old; Southern California; $50: first name, surname, age, place, tariff. This descriptive title makes manifest the heightened awareness of the recording parameters and the nature of the photographic act. DiCorcia refers to Hollywood cinema in his choice of construction in planes. The composition – rather like a montage – creates an encounter between a prostitute and a TV presenter via interlocking frames (door, mirror, television, the framing of the photograph). The fixity of this face to face confronts intimate and social spheres. A certain engagement and a political dimension appear in the work, particularly if one takes into account that the series was executed with a grant from the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) in a context in which American politics were conservative. The artist constructs “a desperate fantasy of Hollywood world” (Peter Galassi) with this ‘hiatus’ image between dream land and uncomfortable reality.","The works of Philip-Lorca diCorcia oscillate between two possible definitions of photography – from a recording system in the tradition of documentary and a system of representation in the tradition of fiction. The use of different contradictory light sources in the same picture is symptomatic of his staging of reality. In Napoli 1996 a man walking down the street in broad daylight is fictionalized by the flash of the camera. Related to the world of cinema in the case of  “Hollywood” (1990-1992), fashion in the series “W” (1997-2000), and advertising, the photographer questions the representation of reality, between the utopia of transparency and necessary construction. “I try to criticize the beast I work with. This monster of whom I share my bed with is about me,” the artist says. His photographs are a space alien in the world of the viewer because of the absorbance of characters. In “Mario” (1978), a man leaning in front of a refrigerator is estranged to the outside world, far from the viewer, denying his/her presence. Immobility is also a constant in the artist’s work. Psychological tension and dramatical equilibrium structure his photographs like enigmas or like “moments suspended in narratives that unfold,” as critic Peter Galassi suggests.Phillip-Lorca diCorcia was born in 1951 in Hartford, Connecticut, USA.","Gerald Hughes, a.k.a.

Angela Detanico & Rafael Lain,"Letters of the Greek alphabet glisten on a black background. When a letter appears, there is a sound. Each letter corresponds to a star in the sky. Alphas, betas, gammas spread in space. The sound attributed to the first letters is high-pitched, then it gets lower for the rest of the letters in alphabetical order. The composition is organised according to the order of magnitude which attributes a letter to every star in the constellation. A cartographic order is established : sequences of alphas, gammas, betas come to pass simultaneously. The positioning of the letters corresponds to that of the stars in the Northern Sky map, their appearance is guided by the distance compared to the previous star. The distance on the map is used as a given time : the closer a star is to the next one in space, the closer it is in space.","Linguists, semiologists and graphic designers by training, Angela Detanico and Raphaël Lain consider the use of graphic signs in society. They are interested in the notion and notation of time and create new typographies by substituting letters from traditional alphabets with forms taken from the everyday. These forms are then displayed in the exhibition spaces which allows for a new materiality to be read. Detanico & Lain consider the role of language. Language reveals its double function, as a communication tool as well as an instrument for reading and a reflection on different cultures.  Oscillating between rudimentary techniques and cutting edge technology, their works take such diverse forms as letters, words, still images, animation, sound and installation. Whether alphabets, cartographies or calendars, they address the actual foundations of these codes that govern our daily lives, certain of the operative links between signs and meaning.

Her work incorporates family photos and everyday objects to reflect a truly original and important contemporary voice. The artist pursues issues of gender by drawing upon the vernacular of popular culture, namely newspapers, television and cinema.","When she was age fifteen Sadie Benning’s father gave her a kiddie PixelVision camera, a device that recorded grainy black-and-white video on standard audio cassettes. She promptly made showstopper single-channel videos—including Me and Rubyfruit and Jollies. The short videos captured her feelings of angst, confusion and alienation, as she was coming out in middle America. (She was the first sixteen-year-old to show her work at MoMA.)  As she continued to make grainy narrative videos, she joined the feminist post-punk band, Le Tigre. Benning slowly moved on to installation, performance, drawing, painting, and then to sculpture. All her work challenges traditional notions of masculinity and femininity, and probes intimate subjects that are close to her personal life.",Mom,Americas,"['popular.a.01', 'culture.n.01', 'newspaper.n.01', 'film.n.02', 'television.n.01', 'voice.n.01', 'issue.n.01', 'original.s.01', 'everyday.s.01', 'function.n.03', 'family.n.01', 'woman.n.01', 'identity.n.01', 'contemporary.s.01', 'medium.n.01', 'object.n.01', 'photograph.n.01', 'image.n.01']","['sex.n.04', 'sex.n.04', 'woman.n.01', 'identity.n.01', 'family.n.01', 'photograph.n.01', 'newspaper.n.01', 'television.n.01', 'film.n.02']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Sadie-Benning_Mom_Kadist-1.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Sadie-Benning_Mom_Kadist-1-239x300.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/mom/,"['Individual_Personal/10.575757575757576', 'Cultural/4.2553921568627455', 'Politics/1.6']","['Individual_Personal', 'Cultural', 'Politics']",16.431149732620323,"['Identity/7.575757575757575', 'Body/2.0', 'Arts/1.675']","['Identity', 'Body', 'Arts']",11.250757575757575,"['Cultural/43.78104471208186', 'Individual_Personal/19.98747918747919', 'Material_Physical/8.421978021978022']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Material_Physical']",72.19050192153907,"['Media/22.291800296366862', 'Arts/7.590262515262515', 'Mind/7.169963369963369']","['Media', 'Arts', 'Mind']",37.05202618159275,0.6666666666666666,0.3333333333333333
Annie Pootoogook,"Annie Pootoogook created COMPOSITION (EEGYVUDLUK DRINKING TEA) at a pivotal moment in her career. The drawing depicts her father Eegyvudluk Pootoogook, an Inuk printmaker and stone sculptor who died in 2000. Kin and kinship figure prominently in the artist’s work: Annie was the daughter of Napachie Pootoogook, a skilled draftswoman, and the granddaughter of renowned artist Pitseolak Ashoona. When Pitseolak was bedridden in her final years, her granddaughter would visit and watch her work; the senior artist told young Annie that one day she too would draw.   Preferring to work alone in her home, Pootoogook approached each of her drawings methodically, outlining forms in graphite before building up details in black ink and filling areas of positive space with brightly colored pencils. Her images reflect a diaristic impulse and are indicative of the Inuit concept of sulijuk, which means ‘true’ or ‘real’. Adding prosaic details such as a clock and electrical socket to her intimate domestic interior, the artist depicts her father in a quiet moment. Seated at a folding table, his hands wrapped around a hot mug of tea, Eegyvudluk gazes forward, his attention captured by something or someone beyond the right edge of the composition. In its realism and immediacy, Pootoogook’s scene is at odds with the traditional outdoor subject matter that many have come to expect from Inuit art. With a singular clarity of vision, the artist depicts an everyday event in modern Inuit life, as she saw it.","An instinctive chronicler of her generation, Annie Pootoogook hailed from a long line of artists in Cape Dorset (known today as Kinngait), Nunavut. She began drawing in 1997 under the encouragement of the West Baffin Eskimo Cooperative in Kinngait. Within a decade, Pootoogook became the catalyst for an explosion of creativity originating from Kinngait Studios. Challenging conventional expectations of ‘Inuit’ graphic art which had favored depictions of Arctic wildlife and indigenous hunting practices, she created works peppered with images of daily life in her community: from waiting in line at the grocery store to sharing meals and watching reality television with her family. Among her most arresting and personal works are those depicting moments of intimate eroticism as well as emotional grief, domestic violence, and substance abuse. Her immediate success drew the attention of a broad cross-section of art collectors; more importantly, it signaled to fellow artists in the North that there were no longer limits to subject matter and scale. Rather than representing scenes of timeless nomadic existence from an era before colonial settlement, Pootoogook’s images reflected the immediate conditions of her life as an indigenous woman artist working in contemporary Canada.",COMPOSITION (EEGYVUDLUK DRINKING TEA),Americas,"['father.n.01', 'details.n.01', 'composition.n.01', 'moment.n.01', 'drawing.n.01', 'edge.n.01', 'pull.v.01', 'capable.s.02', 'matter.n.01', 'concluding.s.01', 'hands.n.01', 'rock.n.01', 'vision.n.01', 'celebrated.s.01', 'day.n.01', 'concept.n.01', 'modern.a.01', 'attention.n.01', 'traditional.a.01', 'real.a.01', 'everyday.s.01', 'event.n.01', 'black.a.01', 'figure.n.01', 'scene.n.01']","['drawing.n.01', 'domestic.n.01', 'confidant.n.01', 'affinity.n.04', 'autochthonal.s.01', 'narrative.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/IMG_AnniP.png,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/IMG_AnniP-217x300.png,https://kadist.org/work/composition-eegyvudluk-drinking-tea/,"['Cultural/2.909090909090909', 'Society/2.0', 'Individual_Personal/1.8']","['Cultural', 'Society', 'Individual_Personal']",6.709090909090909,"['Fantasy/1.9090909090909092', 'Identity/1.0', 'Community/1.0']","['Fantasy', 'Identity', 'Community']",3.909090909090909,"['Material_Physical/16.349017649017654', 'Individual_Personal/9.796214896214897', 'Cultural/8.869683257918552']","['Material_Physical', 'Individual_Personal', 'Cultural']",35.014915803151105,"['Space/7.203296703296703', 'Mind/3.5921855921855923', 'Time/3.5662337662337666']","['Space', 'Mind', 'Time']",14.361716061716061,0.6666666666666666,0.0
Cian Dayrit,"Yuta Nagi Panaad (Promised Land) addresses the impacts of the globalized economy and its powerful ideology on the spaces of everyday life. This tapestry work is a map that aims to visualize the expanding borders of mineral extraction, agri-business plantations and their effects on the communities and the ecology of Mindanao, Philippines. Mindanao has a history of colonialism, exploitation and displacement of its people. Today, foreign multinationals receive protection from local paramilitary organizations and Mindanao has been under martial law since 2017, which means that locals have no avenue to voice concerns and protests. The format of a fabric map –a coded language– was used historically on nomadic murals brought from one colonized state to another by warrior-kings. The work also addresses feudalism and landlessness by pointing to imperialist interests and bureaucratic capitalist landlords.","Cian Dayrit is a Filipino multimedia artist.

Akiq AW,"In the Family Portrait series, Akiq AW documents reliefs and statues in Jogja, Indonesia that present an image of the ideological nuclear family. Following Indonesia’s communal and political conflicts, and its economic collapse and social breakdown of the late 1950s to the mid-1960s, the second Indonesian President Suharto established the “New Order” regime. During this period, there were efforts to control the national birth rate through a programme called “Keluarga Berencana” (Family Planning). A key idea of this programme was the depiction and normalisation of a nuclear family with two parents and two children. During the peak of New Order, from the ‘70s through to the ‘90s, in every neighbourhood and at every village entrance, the nuclear family was represented in the form of reliefs, statues and gates. The New Order was committed to achieving and maintaining political order and economic development through a strong political role for the military, the bureaucratisation and corporatisation of political and societal organisations, and selective but effective repression of opponents. After the New Order ended, the Keluarga Berencana programme did too, but some of the reliefs and statues remained.",Akiq AW is primarily a photographer whose ongoing projects investigate everyday life and how humans face reality through innovation and strategies of their own creation.,Family Portrait,Asia,"['family.n.01', 'political.a.01', 'economic.a.01', 'social.a.01', 'strong.a.01', 'national.a.01', 'represent.v.01', 'late.a.01', 'development.n.01', 'time_period.n.01', 'government.n.01', 'child.n.01', 'name.v.01', 'document.n.01', 'attempt.n.01', 'cardinal.s.01', 'function.n.03', 'portrayal.n.01', 'idea.n.01', 'form.n.01', 'series.n.01']","['family.n.01', 'indonesia.n.01', 'relief.n.10', 'statue.n.01', 'conventional.a.01', 'parent.n.01', 'child.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/IMG-Set-Images_Indonesian-Family-Portrait-Series.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/IMG-Set-Images_Indonesian-Family-Portrait-Series-300x112.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/family-portrait/,"['Material_Physical/5.171241830065359', 'Cultural/4.886824905400757', 'Society/4.179084967320261']","['Material_Physical', 'Cultural', 'Society']",14.237151702786377,"['Land/5.171241830065359', 'Arts/4.886824905400757', 'Urbanization/3.1790849673202617']","['Land', 'Arts', 'Urbanization']",13.237151702786377,"['Individual_Personal/24.21800421800423', 'Cultural/17.758608058608065', 'Society/15.760692248927548']","['Individual_Personal', 'Cultural', 'Society']",57.73730452553984,"['Culture/5.75970695970696', 'Spirituality/5.6289377289377285', 'Values/5.12967032967033']","['Culture', 'Spirituality', 'Values']",16.51831501831502,0.6666666666666666,0.0

Robert Zhao Renhui,"The photograph Proxy II (Beetles) belongs to a series focusing on the ecology of Christmas Island—a small volcanic outcrop in the Indian Ocean which was transferred from Singapore to Australia in 1958. Since the establishment of the first human settlements in the late 19th century, the ecosystem of Christmas Island has undergone dramatic changes. The nearly 150 years of human settlement have introduced a number of invasive species onto the island who have severely impacted a fragile ecosystem, imperiling the island’s wildlife and causing the extinction of a number of native species. As a result, extreme biocontrol strategies are currently being undertaken in an attempt to restore the island’s biodiversity. The photograph is of a beautiful bird on Christmas island, without indicating if it’s endangered or invasive. The strong white light and white background suggest a fabricated setting, away from the natural habitat of the bird, reinforcing the abnormality of the situation.","Robert Zhao Renhui’s photographic prints question fact-based presentations of conservation and highlight the manner through which documentary, journalistic, or scientific reports sensationalize nature in order to elicit viewer sympathy. Zhao portrays human as figures curious about their natural environment, which is at times mysterious and unpredictable. Through observing human behavior in front of animals rather than that of the animals themselves, Zhao’s critical lens examines various modes of what he calls a “zoological gaze,” the manner through which humans view animals and nature. His works create visual ambiguity so the viewer becomes aware of assumptions made about the way images present facts. Zhao received a Bachelor of Fine Arts in photography at Caberwell College of Arts and a Masters degree at the London College of Communication, where he graduated with distinction.",Proxy II (Beetles),Asia,"['island.n.01', 'white.a.01', 'human.a.01', 'scheme.n.01', 'strong.a.01', 'native.a.01', 'setting.n.01', 'late.a.01', 'photograph.n.01', 'background.n.01', 'century.n.01', 'natural.a.01', 'situation.n.01', 'attempt.n.01', 'consequence.n.01', 'light.n.01', 'series.n.01']","['ecology.n.01', 'oceania.n.01', 'colonization.n.01', 'encroaching.s.01', 'wildlife.n.01', 'biodiversity.n.01', 'extinction.n.02']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/RobertZhao.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/RobertZhao-300x200.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/proxy-ii-beetles/,"['Material_Physical/3.3396825396825394', 'Individual_Personal/1.7802197802197801', 'Society/1.7619047619047619']","['Material_Physical', 'Individual_Personal', 'Society']",6.881807081807081,"['Environmental/1.7619047619047619', 'Colonization/1.0', 'Body/0.9230769230769231']","['Environmental', 'Colonization', 'Body']",3.684981684981685,"['Individual_Personal/13.835653235653242', 'Cultural/13.131668821374706', 'Society/9.005738705738706']","['Individual_Personal', 'Cultural', 'Society']",35.97306076276666,"['Spirituality/4.026373626373627', 'Time/3.375757575757576', 'History/3.3222222222222224']","['Spirituality', 'Time', 'History']",10.724353424353426,0.6666666666666666,0.0
Felipe Arturo,"Primero estaba el mar (First Was the Sea, 2012) is a system of equivalences between syllables and silhouettes of waveforms cast in cement. Each waveform represents a syllable of the sentence “Primero estaba el mar.” This sentence is the first verse of the Kogui poem of creation. For the Koguis, an indigenous community from the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta on the Colombian Caribbean coast, water was the absolute presence before the creation of the universe. The Colombian writer Tomás González used this phrase as the title of his first novel, in which he narrates the story of a couple in Medellín who, following the anarchic and hippie trends of the 1970s, abandon civilization and move to a solitary beach. Instead of leaving modernity behind, however, the couple becomes a colonizing force, transforming the natural environment of the beach into a rationalized territory. Under the logic proposed by Primero estaba el mar, the variation of the order of the waveforms represents different possibilities for this sentence. The work produces eight different phrases that assimilate the idea of repetition and change; the sentence has eight syllables, and each syllable-waveform is repeated eight times in order to reconstruct the title eight different times, resulting in a total of sixty-four pieces.","Felipe Arturo considers elements from urbanism, architecture, and art in relation to politics, history, geography, and economy. His works and projects often manifest as sculptures, installations, or videos, departing from concepts such as structure, sequence, and matter. They are deeply influenced by vernacular architecture and construction techniques, and reflect processes of assimilation and resistance to colonial and postcolonial processes. He frequently combines the language and materials of Modernism (e.g., concrete) with the informal methods of autoconstrucción (self-construction).",Primero Estaba el Mar,Americas,"['phrase.n.01', 'times.n.01', 'creation.n.01', 'title.n.01', 'sea.n.01', 'district.n.01', 'universe.n.01', 'change.n.01', 'repeat.n.01', 'writer.n.01', 'water.n.01', 'possibility.n.01', 'community.n.01', 'natural.a.01', 'presence.n.01', 'environment.n.01', 'idea.n.01', 'piece.n.01', 'narrative.n.01']","['genesis.n.01', 'civilization.n.01', 'ocean.n.01', 'everyday.s.01', 'concrete.n.01', 'beginning.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/primero_estaba_el_mar_felipe_arturo_general_view_2012_web.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/primero_estaba_el_mar_felipe_arturo_general_view_2012_web-300x200.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/primero-estaba-el-mar/,"['Material_Physical/5.7435897435897445', 'Society/2.4475524475524475', 'Individual_Personal/1.5384615384615385']","['Material_Physical', 'Society', 'Individual_Personal']",9.72960372960373,"['Time/3.371794871794872', 'Physics/1.6025641025641026', 'Community/0.9090909090909091']","['Time', 'Physics', 'Community']",5.883449883449884,"['Individual_Personal/32.111355311355325', 'Material_Physical/29.389377289377297', 'Cultural/21.103310904781498']","['Individual_Personal', 'Material_Physical', 'Cultural']",82.60404350551411,"['Urbanization/9.356043956043957', 'Spirituality/8.767399267399266', 'Land/7.576556776556776']","['Urbanization', 'Spirituality', 'Land']",25.700000000000003,0.6666666666666666,0.0

The images capture scenes from an urban development, La Vega, built to modernize and connect favelas in Venezuela. Using money from the newly nationalized oil industry in the 1970s, La Vega and Los Manalos became examples of a utopian promise—that the money accruing from the oil industry would be distributed to better the lives of the people.

Nicolás Consuegra,"A residency program in the blazing hot city of Honda, Colombia, inspired artist Nicolás Consuegra to consider the difficulty in understanding the needs of a distant community. An important town during the colonial era as the main port on the Magdalena River, Honda is presently rife with poverty, unemployment, and environmental deterioration. Here he produced the work Nadie sabe de la sed con que otro bebe (No one knows the thirst with which another drinks), a variable arrangement of cut glasses in front of a mirror so that they appear whole. The title, a popular euphemism taken literally, affirms the impossibility of knowing another person’s experience. In a mirror reflection the glasses appear to be complete, manifesting an innate human paradox: a reflection of unity, but only as reversed projection or doubling.","Nicolás Consuegra (b. 1976, lives in Bogotá) explores the contradictions of modern visual culture through his photographs, sculptures, paintings, and installations.

Javier M. Rodríguez,"Javier M. Rodriguez’s Going Round and Round in a Line ST (12m) is a sculptural composition made of the simplest materials—a single tape measure and metal rivets.

Jazmín López,"Shot on 35mm in two simply framed shots, Jazmín López’s Juego Vivo captures children at play, mixing imagination, reality, innocence, and violence. Set within a lush, green forest, we see first several children come into the frame, walking towards us, as a disembodied voice counts off “Tres…cuatro…cinco…” A game of hide and seek is at hand, and sounds of the girl counting are met with scattering children. In the first shot, while everyone else disperses, one boy advances steadily toward the camera, holding a scavenged stick in his hands, wielding it like a gun. He takes aim and makes a shooting noise; then, the camera reverses. The soundtrack repeats, as the girl, now in the frame, recites her counting. “Tres…cuatro…cinco…seis…” At the sound of the fake gunshot, a wound appears on the girl’s belly, and she falls, heavily, into the green growth of the forest.","Graduated from the Universidad del Cine in Buenos Aires, Jazmín López is a visual artist and filmmaker who has presented film projects in the 69 Venice Biennale, New Directors New Films at MoMA and Lincoln Center, Centre George Pompidou, KW institute Berlin among others.",Juego Vivo,Unspecified,"['child.n.01', 'shooting.n.01', 'sound.n.01', 'frame.n.01', 'camera.n.01', 'male_child.n.01', 'purpose.n.01', 'imagination.n.01', 'repeat.n.01', 'hands.n.01', 'voice.n.01', 'game.n.01', 'play.n.01', 'set.n.01', 'violence.n.01', 'hand.n.01', 'world.n.03']","['hide-and-seek.n.01', 'purity.n.02', 'violence.n.01', 'imagination.n.01', 'wound.n.01', 'gun.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/jazmin_lopez_juego_vivo_web.png,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/jazmin_lopez_juego_vivo_web-300x219.png,https://kadist.org/work/juego-vivo/,"['Individual_Personal/7.588461538461539', 'Politics/7.348868778280543', 'Society/5.438477415257601']","['Individual_Personal', 'Politics', 'Society']",20.375807731999682,"['Power/4.838461538461539', 'Violence/3.657775660871636', 'Fantasy/2.8083333333333336']","['Power', 'Violence', 'Fantasy']",11.304570532666508,"['Cultural/20.203937728937735', 'Individual_Personal/14.198351648351652', 'Society/10.011017740429505']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Society']",44.41330711771889,"['Culture/7.041758241758242', 'Mind/5.876923076923077', 'Spirituality/5.007142857142856']","['Culture', 'Mind', 'Spirituality']",17.925824175824175,0.6666666666666666,0.0

Asier Mendizabal,"Rotation presents the image of a crowd, a re-appropriation of 19th or beginning of 20th century photographs published in newspapers and magazines. This artwork is composed of the same image repeated four times with different resolutions. The last image in Rotation is less focused than the original one.  These pictures are low-angle shots, in a way that the subject is seen as part of a group rather than as an isolated person. This work denies the individual subject but also highlights the symbolic force of the masses.  The representation of crowds is a good means to highlight the way ideology creates forms. The photographic montage strategy – which is a process introduced by modernity – reveals an aspect of accumulation as well as fragmentation and destruction. Going from the top right to the bottom right, the image fades into becoming almost illegible and only the outline of the impression remains; as if identity whether it is national, political or ethnic was too difficult or impossible to represent.  This is a reference to popular culture and a reflection on collective gestures, the survival of rituals and the creation of a social landscape.","Asier Mendizabal explores political subjects and their symbols. His work is based on a formalist approach using abstract forms which recall Russian constructivism in painting, in sculpture as well as in cinema. He rethinks the relations between abstraction and the representation of politics. He was born in 1973 in the Basque Country and he uses the history of Basque politics as a background for his work.","Rotation (Moiré, Rome)",Europe,"['subject.n.01', 'image.n.01', 'newspaper.n.01', 'magazine.n.01', 'scheme.n.01', 'national.a.01', 'times.n.01', 'represent.v.01', 'print.v.01', 'destruction.n.01', 'creation.n.01', 'aspect.n.01', 'picture.n.01', 'symbolic.a.01', 'popular.a.01', 'compose.v.01', 'corporate.s.03', 'contemplation.n.02', 'collage.n.01', 'century.n.01', 'shooting.n.01', 'individual.a.01', 'original.s.01', 'gesture.n.01', 'person.n.01']","['popular.s.04', 'disintegrate.v.01', 'social_group.n.01', 'repetition.n.02', 'crowd.n.01', 'ritual.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/mendizabal1.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/mendizabal1-300x200.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/rotation-moire-rome/,"['Society/13.06329813976873', 'Politics/5.666666666666666', 'Cultural/4.201307189542483']","['Society', 'Politics', 'Cultural']",22.93127199597788,"['Community/4.9222222222222225', 'Culture/3.401307189542483', 'History/2.6013071895424833']","['Community', 'Culture', 'History']",10.92483660130719,"['Cultural/43.33992159147295', 'Individual_Personal/24.40687115601977', 'Society/17.941743788883382']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Society']",85.6885365363761,"['Media/14.885904334743346', 'Arts/10.065196078431372', 'Time/7.689005602240896']","['Media', 'Arts', 'Time']",32.64010601541561,0.6666666666666666,0.0
Daniela Ortiz,"In her work, Maids Room (2012) which is part of a series, Daniela Ortiz undertakes an architectural analysis of the houses belonging to the upper class of Lima. Her research highlights the position of ‘service architecture’, the vital space given to the domestics. The project offers an analysis of this room, its size and its position in relation to the rest of the house.  This study is based on houses constructed between 1930 and 2012. The project examines a selection of 60 houses by presenting the architect’s project, the front of the buildings, floor plans, comparative dimensions of the rooms.  The choice of presenting a composition of several photographs of various dimensions recalls the aesthetic of conceptual photography. It is disturbing to go from the formal beauty of the images and of the architecture represented to the revealed reality, showing the deadlock of modernist architecture carried on in contemporary architecture.  Daniela Ortiz’s work creates, without any indulgence, spaces of tension which explore the notion of social class, race and nationality accentuating the fact that societies are built on the notions of inclusion and exclusion.","Through her work, Daniela Ortiz aims to generate visual narratives in which the concepts of nationality, racialization, social class and gender are explored in order to critically understand structures of colonial, patriarchal and capitalist power. Her recent projects and research deal with the European migratory control system, its links to colonialism and the legal structure created by European institutions in order to inflict violence towards racialized and migrant communities. She has also developed projects about the Peruvian upper class and its exploitative relationship with domestic workers. Recently her artistic practice has turned back into visual and manual work, developing art pieces in ceramic, collage and in formats such as children books in order to take distance from Eurocentric conceptual art aesthetics.",Maids Rooms,Americas,"['architecture.n.01', 'house.n.01', 'dimension.n.01', 'class.n.01', 'position.n.01', 'undertaking.n.01', 'impression.n.01', 'construct.v.01', 'race.n.01', 'plan.n.01', 'architectural.a.01', 'conceptual.s.01', 'beauty.n.01', 'space.n.01', 'survey.n.01', 'formal.a.01', 'floor.n.01', 'relation.n.01', 'tension.n.01', 'photography.n.01', 'building.n.01', 'society.n.01', 'composition.n.01', 'establish.v.08', 'contemporary.s.01']","['architecture.n.01', 'housing.n.01', 'domestic.a.02', 'class.n.03', 'race.n.03', 'inequality.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/daniela_ortiz_maids_rooms_bd.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/daniela_ortiz_maids_rooms_bd-300x195.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/maids-rooms/,"['Society/6.844555444555444', 'Cultural/5.067760180995475', 'Politics/3.4333333333333336']","['Society', 'Cultural', 'Politics']",15.345648958884253,"['Arts/5.067760180995475', 'Familial/1.9333333333333333', 'Inequality/1.8333333333333335']","['Arts', 'Familial', 'Inequality']",8.834426847662142,"['Cultural/21.017504167658974', 'Individual_Personal/16.447017997482394', 'Society/11.725579975579974']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Society']",49.19010214072134,"['Arts/10.73032468047948', 'Values/7.571428571428572', 'Culture/5.415384615384616']","['Arts', 'Values', 'Culture']",23.71713786729267,0.6666666666666666,0.3333333333333333
Cally Spooner,"The installation Self Tracking (the five stages of grief) was realized from a performance that is to be re-activated. One of the rows in the piece corresponds to the artist’s metabolism data, another to the artist’s ranking data in Artfacts.net and the data of the World Trusted Currency Authority on the exchange rate of the pound sterling against the euro between 2012 and 2016. There is an interposing orange line, a trace of self-tanning lotion that signals the presence of the body. This piece represents the identity of the artist from analytical data. She is simultaneously defined by purely physiological data, then by Artfacts.net, then reduced to financial indicators, then situated in the global economic context. The presence of the body with the self-tanning lotion allows for the creation of a fragile counterpoint that locks the individual into pre-established norms.","The work of Cally Spooner (b. 1983, based in London) includes essays, multimedia installations, and performances. She studied philosophy after studying dance and theater for several years. The body, and gesture become devices for transcribing the domain of language and theory. The artist insists that production must be in perpetual evolution, through architecture, a museum and the bodies of the interpreters. This process creates an extra form, and leaves the work open. She always establishes a distance from the historical practice of performance. This is the distance in the sense that she doesn’t participate in the performances, but directs them.

Daniel Boccato,"Birdstones is a series of flat concrete slabs made from moldings of different shapes, each with two small holes. They stand vertically in space in a precarious stance. Heavy by the density of the concrete, they are also airy and floating.

They are monuments in tribute to the extreme fragility of the bird that since antiquity represents spirituality and freedom. We are facing a lost paradise without the beauty having completely disappeared. In these abstract forms are always present two orifices, a look that questions us.

Daniel Boccato,"Parrot Drawings or Paintings look like children’s drawings and seem quite innocent. The parrot in both the Garden of Eden and the harems are associated with the symbol of purity and innocence. These symbols are found in Renaissance painting, especially in the Annunciations or the Virgins and child and later in Flemish portraits. White, originally, the wings of the archangel Gabriel will also become iridescent in the representations of the Annunciation during the Renaissance. The parrot is spotted frequently in the painting of the 19th century, notably with Delacroix and Courbet. But in this work, there is a change in the symbolism, the parrot being linked to scenes where sensuality or lust reigns. These childish representations in their realization take into account all these dimensions and references.

Alex Da Corte,"Slow Graffiti was produced for Da Corte’s exhibition at the Vienna Secession in 2017. The video is a shot-for-shot remake of the film “The Perfect Human” by Danish filmmaker Jørgen Leth (1967). The original is narrated in an anthropological manner, or as if listening to a guide at a zoo, but Da Corte’s version is stranger and more philosophical. Leth’s film has uncomfortable implications, such as: is the perfect human white, attractive, detached? The original, which is shot with a sense of fashion (resembling contemporary clothing commercials), offers mixed signals about objectivity, and at the very least a provocation about the notion of human perfection.  Slow Graffiti features the artist performing Frankenstein, specifically the monster as brought to life by the actor Boris Karloff. During an interview, Karloff made the statement, “that monster was the best friend I ever had,” in speaking about his iconic portrayal of Frankenstein in the 1931 Hollywood film. This statement animates Da Corte’s Frankenstein, caught in forces tender, humorous, absurd and destructive. As an icon, Frankenstein represents ‘an idea come to life’ but also absorbs through metaphor the kind of transformations that results from technological intervention. In the original story by Mary Shelley Frankenstein is also composed of many different parts, from different bodies, and so suggests an assembled identity, mixed background, polyphonic references and influences, that continue to find relevance in contemporary life.  The voiceover and audio-track, which diverges in bizarre, critical, suggestive, and poetic ways was scored by Devonté Hynes.","Alex Da Corte’s works conveys a state of delusion, where logic is set aside in order to access the stranger, deeper parts of our minds. In this state he wrestles with vernacular culture, often taking a run at iconic figures and motifs from the inventory of popular American consumables. Da Corte’s work has roots in Pop-art and is imbued with a love and feeling for color as well as a sense of how a store-front-window display might turn tragicomic. This odd portmanteau, a combination of ‘tragic’ and ‘comic,’ speaks to a conflicted identity, a sense of pathos, an emotional zone between or beyond categories. In Da Corte’s work, a sense of dry comedy, sometimes mixed with the abject or absurd, is balanced with the macabre or heart-breaking.",Slow Graffiti,Americas,"['statement.n.01', 'original.s.01', 'contemporary.s.01', 'manner.n.01', 'movie.n.01', 'life.n.01', 'human.a.01', 'interview.n.01', 'icon.n.01', 'force.n.01', 'transformation.n.01', 'shoot.v.01', 'critical.a.01', 'version.n.01', 'actor.n.01', 'iconic.a.01', 'intervention.n.01', 'poetic.a.01', 'compose.v.01', 'metaphor.n.01', 'produce.v.01', 'background.n.01', 'impression.n.01', 'mention.n.01', 'portrayal.n.01']","['tragicomic.a.01', 'ghastly.s.01', 'aesthetics.n.01', 'identity.n.01', 'beauty.n.01', 'transformation.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/IMG_Slow-Grafitti_WEB-copy.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/IMG_Slow-Grafitti_WEB-copy-300x200.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/slow-graffiti/,"['Individual_Personal/7.502491076175287', 'Cultural/7.386549707602339', 'Society/2.4040100250626564']","['Individual_Personal', 'Cultural', 'Society']",17.293050808840285,"['Arts/4.930994152046783', 'Identity/4.797979797979798', 'History/1.6040100250626566']","['Arts', 'Identity', 'History']",11.332983975089238,"['Cultural/16.609396159396162', 'Individual_Personal/10.427106227106227', 'Material_Physical/4.9282051282051285']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Material_Physical']",31.96470751470752,"['Fantasy/4.144988344988345', 'Media/4.0970085470085476', 'Values/3.4571428571428573']","['Fantasy', 'Media', 'Values']",11.69913974913975,0.6666666666666666,0.0
Anthony Discenza,"A Viewing (The Effect) by Anthony Discenza is a continuous voiceover loop intended for presentation in a dedicated, light-and-acoustically controlled space. “The Effect” employs hundreds of fragments of text culled from the internet by searching for occurrences of the title phrase. These fragments, which all address visual scenarios, were sequenced and edited to create the impression of a single text; this was recorded as a voiceover and presented in an acoustically controlled space devoid of any visual information. Superficially, the spoken text seems to be a description of a sequence of imagery; however, because of the text’s composite nature, the precise etiology of this imagery is elusive. The smoothly modulated voice of the voiceover actor and repetition of the linking phrase function as formal devices, drawing listeners into a meditative space in which visually descriptive language is abstracted, becoming a scaffold for the construction of an internalized viewing experience.","Since the late 1990s Anthony Discenza’s work has focused primarily on the omnipresence of mainstream media.

Yan Xing,"The title of this series – Two videos, three photographs, several related masterpieces and American art – is paradoxical, suggesting the work is conceived in relation to its medium and a situation in art history and the region of the world in which it was made. Paradoxical but in the end, often true of the way in which art history is written. The presence of black men and the term “American Art” brings us back to Robert Mapplethorpe’s Black Book. Certain critics had judged this book as racist, with the idea that the black man is reduced to an object. For his defenders, it was above all, research into beauty, as in ancient Greece where art has created an ideal beauty in a platonic vision. Yan Xing is interested in transformations and interpretations. This series is conceived as a parody of American art thought of pure abstraction. An America that can refuse to think of itself as a land of emigration, crossed by the themes of racism and gender that are at the origin of the construction of its own identity. The American culture and the culture of appropriation, a certain form of cannibalism that nourishes other cultures, is at the center of this series.","Yan Xing, currently based between Los Angeles and Beijing, is known for his interdisciplinary projects that include sculpture, performance, video, photography and installation. The artist’s projects are often complex and conceptual with the body remaining central to all explorations. Through critical examinations, the artist imagines how history constructs our present. He interrogates literature, history and history of art. His work explores themes of negativity, resistance and order and the complexity of their connectivity.","Two videos, three photographs, several related masterpieces, and American Art",Asia,"['american.n.01', 'beauty.n.01', 'culture.n.01', 'american.a.01', 'book.n.01', 'black.a.01', 'series.n.01', 'transformation.n.01', 'history.n.01', 'region.n.01', 'black.n.01', 'abstraction.n.01', 'united_states.n.01', 'land.n.01', 'vision.n.01', 'relation.n.01', 'write.v.01', 'interpretation.n.01', 'construction.n.01', 'presence.n.01', 'situation.n.01', 'center.n.01', 'beginning.n.04', 'identity.n.01', 'idea.n.01']","['paradox.n.01', 'race.n.03', 'racism.n.01', 'gender.n.01', 'culture.n.01', 'history.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/YX_AmericanArt_photo2_2013.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/YX_AmericanArt_photo2_2013-300x240.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/two-videos-three-photographs-several-related-masterpiecesand-american-art/,"['Cultural/4.390476190476191', 'Politics/3.594771241830065', 'Material_Physical/2.509090909090909']","['Cultural', 'Politics', 'Material_Physical']",10.494338341397164,"['Inequality/3.594771241830065', 'Time/2.509090909090909', 'Fantasy/2.4571428571428573']","['Inequality', 'Time', 'Fantasy']",8.56100500806383,"['Individual_Personal/31.400330225330233', 'Material_Physical/25.927075848128492', 'Cultural/21.82236680625428']","['Individual_Personal', 'Material_Physical', 'Cultural']",79.149772879713,"['Mind/10.106471306471308', 'Land/10.013655934708567', 'Values/8.40467032967033']","['Mind', 'Land', 'Values']",28.524797570850204,0.6666666666666666,0.0
Beverly Buchanan,"Made between 1986 and 2015, Buchanan’s Shack Sculptures are a result of the artist’s close observation and extensive research of ‘shotgun’ houses, where one room is arranged in sequence one behind the other; the rural poor inhabited these houses. They were often constructed for rent near railways or manufacturing centers, but by the late twentieth century tended to be owner-occupied. By engaging with this architectural form, Buchanan considers the economic consequences of the abandonment of this form of housing as a result of the ubiquity of the motorcar that permitted people to move to the suburbs, where there was less pressure on space. In the South, where Buchanan lived and worked, superstitions were attached to this form of building that held that ghosts and spirits could pass straight through them, so doors were deliberately misaligned to deter them. Country Family Home is an excellent example from the Shack Sculptures series that explores the history of these ruined buildings, subjected to a battering by nature and life, and which are somehow kept alive to provide shelter for the disadvantaged. The patchwork nature of the shack suggests a hand-to-mouth existence but also the ingenuity of those who kept these buildings going against all odds. The title has ironic and cynical overtones, referring to country houses normally being considered as secondary residencies of the affluent. The artist’s emphasis on ruins foregrounds the central and pertinent theme of the necessity of survival.","Beverly Buchanan initially trained as a public health educator having studied medical technology and came to art later, training at the Art Students League under Norman Lewis and finding mentorship in Romare Bearden. Buchanan’s practice traverses site-specific interventions, photographs, drawings, painting and sculpture, and while her practice has often been considered as folk art, her work subverts the boundaries of categorization. Rather her practice boundlessly explores issues of race, gender and memory; dealing intimately with issues related to racial discrimination and hardship, slavery, the overlooked and the daily lives of the disadvantaged. The only major show she had was conceived in her lifetime and came to view posthumously in 2016 at the Brooklyn Museum. Early concrete sculpture recalled ancient tombs as well as dialoguing with the primary structures of contemporary minimalists. Buchanan is best known for a series of paintings and sculptures of shacks from which the present work is selected. Buchanan was born in North Carolina, raised in South Carolina and spent much of her working life as an artist in Georgia. Her experiences as an African American woman in the southern states of America manifest a sincere and intimate sense of hardship, knowledge and growth — the voice of struggle that deserves to be amplified today.",Country Family Home,Americas,"['house.n.01', 'building.n.01', 'consequence.n.01', 'state.n.04', 'nature.n.01', 'form.n.01', 'sculpture.n.01', 'ghost.n.01', 'being.n.01', 'architectural.a.01', 'late.a.01', 'sequence.n.01', 'see.v.05', 'south.n.01', 'economic.a.01', 'century.n.01', 'center.n.01', 'cardinal.s.01', 'family.n.01', 'construct.v.01', 'subject.n.01', 'people.n.01', 'title.n.01', 'history.n.01', 'life.n.01']","['architecture.n.01', 'class_struggle.n.01', 'poverty.n.01', 'economic.a.01', 'housing.n.01', 'superstition.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/HQ20-BB12734_Country-Family-Home.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/HQ20-BB12734_Country-Family-Home-300x247.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/country-family-home/,"['Individual_Personal/9.126739926739926', 'Cultural/8.944683257918554', 'Politics/7.716025641025641']","['Individual_Personal', 'Cultural', 'Politics']",25.78744882568412,"['Arts/5.067760180995475', 'Power/4.116025641025641', 'Mind/3.2527472527472527']","['Arts', 'Power', 'Mind']",12.43653307476837,"['Material_Physical/28.194971694971702', 'Society/16.801984126984127', 'Individual_Personal/16.705512134923904']","['Material_Physical', 'Society', 'Individual_Personal']",61.70246795687973,"['Land/13.996336996337', 'Arts/10.227400703871295', 'Materiality/6.656643356643357']","['Land', 'Arts', 'Materiality']",30.880381056851654,0.3333333333333333,0.3333333333333333
Oliver Beer,"To watch the videos: (Extract 1) https://vimeo.com/78331969 , (Extract 2) https://vimeo.com/78526418  password: obeerpreview  Pay and Display is a film of a performance, for which there was no audience, staged in the multistory Pershore Street car park in Birmingham, a brutalist building, arguably one of the most inhospitable environments for a musical performance. Dilapidated and empty, the ghostly presence of the car park comes to life. Beer composed the piece to resonate with this architecture, finding the frequencies that would bring the building to life, acting as a sound box and in effect another voice. Thus the inherent harmonies of the architecture are revealed. The building becomes almost a mythical figure constantly harrying the public working itself into a frenzy of demands for money. The quasi-religious nature of the music suggests the primacy of mammon in our society, climaxing on the word Sunday, which is the day of worship in the Christian week. The text of the piece is based on the signs that are scattered insistently around the car park: ‘Have you paid and displayed except on Sunday’. There is thus a consonance between the vocal score, written in six parts, and the environment. His choice of building was in line with the project as a whole, which seeks to animate spaces that are generally forgotten, hidden or unremarked but which play an essential social role. The film is played on two large-scale screens with high quality sound, creating an intense immersive experience.  The work of Oliver Beer explores the resonances in buildings and objects, exploiting the occurrence of natural frequencies that turn buildings and objects not only into amplifiers but musical instruments. Having studied musical composition at the Guildhall School of Music, he then trained as a fine artist at Ruskin School of Art. The artist combines expert musical knowledge with fine art practice to create performances, objects and films. Most recently, his piece for four voices was performed at Thaddaeus Ropac Gallery in London. Four singers, each in a different corner of the room, sang a score he composed specifically for the room, having established on what notes the room would resonate. In Beer’s practice, the room becomes a massive sound box, a wind instrument that is an extension of the singers’ own wind instrument, and the voice that resonates in the mind. The building, in effect, sings back to the singers. While there something quite Orphic about this process, the resonance equally has a strong relationship to the Platonic belief in the harmonics of the universe. The resonance project pitches sublime sound with the most banal, or democratic of architecture. Car parks, sewers, concert halls, corridors, vestibules and staircases have been the venues for his work, all of which is site specific.","The work of Oliver Beer explores the resonances in buildings and objects, exploiting the occurrence of natural frequencies that turn buildings and objects not only into amplifiers but musical instruments.

Melvin Moti,"Cluster Illusion examines the brain’s tendency to recognize a pattern as something abstract. Rather than seeing the distinct dots of which the images are composed, our brains turn these dots into illusory clouds. This series is a study of human vision and a commentary on the human urge to find shapes and patterns in anything, giving coherence to the whole. Thus, the relationship between the part and the whole, in other words, between the local and the global, and between nature and culture is on display in Cluster Illusion.  This work can also be read as a representation of the debate on climate change and the anthropocene, whereby human impact on nature is either an illusion or a scientific fact. Here we note that the work depicts sunlight shining through clouds, which appears almost photographic. However, one can also see how each image is composed of a meticulous Japanese pattern. Combining ancient traditions and modern techniques, this work also blends the historic with the contemporary. The smooth character of silk draws the viewer close to the surface, a surface that is rather optical and tactile, so that one can observe how almost photographic images turn into abstract patterns. Each silk piece (123.00 x 173.00cm) is handmade by a Tokyo-based kimono dyer, following the traditional kimono technique.","Scientific research, high and mass culture, and the processes of cultural production in contemporary society plays an important role in the work of Rotterdam-born artist Melvin Moti, currently based in Rotterdam and in Berlin. The artist whose practice traverses films, books, objects and drawing, enquires into the power of human imagination and abstraction, looking at how perception works neurologically and psychologically. His earlier works include a guided tour in the empty rooms of the Hermitage through memory (No Show, 2004), the human ability to make images appear on the retina from total darkness (The Prisoner’s Cinema, 2008) or the representation of the fourth dimension (The Eightfold Dot, 2013). The artist gives form to obscure anecdotes, incidents, and individuals — or, what he calls black holes — that he claims haven’t been contextualized by official history. Concerned with history and its influence in cultural production, Moti researched the Cosmists, an early twentieth century Russian group of thinkers responsible for Cosmism, the philosophical and cultural movement that combined occult and esoteric theories with space science. By comparing statistics, scientist and member of the Cosmists, Alexander Chizhevsky, discovered a correlation between solar activity (such as sunspots) and major historical events on earth (such as wars, revolutions, epidemics and natural disasters). In several studies Chizhevsky describes how one can observe an increase in wars, revolutions, and in epidemics on earth during years of high amounts of solar activity, while years with a low amount of solar activity correspond to a decrease of military and political events on earth.

Clément Rodzielski,"These photographs are installation shots of the exhibition De A à B, de B à P at Bielefelder Kunstverein (13 November 2010-30 January 2011). There, Clément Rodzielski had chosen to exhibit the series called Miroirs noirs (Black Mirrors, black and white abstract screen prints) which is emblematic of his work. The piece of painted wood was not shown to the public; it moves and invests the space enigmatically. On the other hand, the painting which dialogues with the works on the wall and serves as a yardstick in space has now disappeared. It only exists in and for the photographic images that keep a trace of its brief existence. The small painting had been entrusted to the exhibition photographer who was in charge of placing the work in the space while taking the pictures. The four photographs were presented at Confort Moderne (Poitiers) for the second incarnation of the exhibition (18 March-8 May, 2011).  In this work, Clément Rodzielski considers the exhibition-making process itself and includes the movement of artworks and of the exhibition space from Bielefeld to Poitiers. Protocols for the fabrication, the hang and the documentation constructs a production system which has been imagined for both exhibitions. The artist confronts the documentary qualities of the work produced this way (real exhibition shots/ the fictional intrusion of a “supplementary” object ; a black and white document which flattens the colored painting) choosing an imposing format, worthy of a photographic tableau : the whole installation thus recreates a  space in which we projects ourselves as one recalls that the artist’s practice is largely linked to in situ projects.","Like many artists of his generation, Clément Rodzielski (born in 1979 in Albi, France) is a well-informed onlooker who works with existing images in order to reveal their mechanisms of construction and circulation. But he concentrates in particular on images which are under our eyes but not seen any longer (motifs found on internet, murals in the urban settings) or don’t circulate (retro cinema posters). Based on these images, he isolates motifs or signs, multiplies different supports and gestures in order to reveal their  materiality (wallpainting, collage, cut-outs, photocopies, stencil, spray paint…) and reframe them so they can be seen better. Making abstract images and de-contextualizing them enables better attention on their pictoriality.  Repeating the same operations in order to exhaust any possibilities of a gesture, Rodzielski’s practice involves numerous series. From pictorial spaces to exhibition spaces, in situ work reclaims its rights as he orchestrates his hang like installation with variable combinations.",Untitled,Europe,"['black.a.01 white.a.01', 'space.n.01', 'photographic.a.01', 'black.a.01', 'white.a.01', 'undertaking.n.01', 'populace.n.01', 'mirror.n.01', 'wood.n.01', 'being.n.01', 'fictional.a.01', 'documentation.n.01', 'black.n.01', 'abstraction.n.01', 'trace.n.01', 'documentary.a.01', 'photograph.n.01', 'photographer.n.01', 'format.n.01', 'print.n.01', 'picture.n.01', 'production.n.01', 'quality.n.01', 'screen.n.01', 'shooting.n.01']","['fragility.n.01', 'thaw.n.01', 'everyday.s.03', 'form.n.03', 'dissolve.v.10', 'minimalism.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/crodzielski1.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/crodzielski1-300x200.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/sans-titre/,"['Material_Physical/2.6263736263736264', 'Cultural/1.0', 'Individual_Personal/0.8']","['Material_Physical', 'Cultural', 'Individual_Personal']",4.426373626373627,"['Environmental/1.6263736263736264', 'Design/1.0', 'Time/1.0']","['Environmental', 'Design', 'Time']",3.6263736263736264,"['Cultural/24.377379156790926', 'Politics/18.20266692371956', 'Individual_Personal/17.40170954776218']","['Cultural', 'Politics', 'Individual_Personal']",59.981755628272666,"['Arts/5.745604395604396', 'Values/5.644230769230768', 'Technology/5.582956259426847']","['Arts', 'Values', 'Technology']",16.972791424262013,0.6666666666666666,0.0
Imran Qureshi,"There was a tragedy in Sialkot, Punjab, in August 2010, when two adolescents were murdered by vigilantes who were apparently in connivance with the police. Struck by this blunder revealing police corruption, the started a series of paintings on paper, You who are my love and my life’s enemy too, in which he expressed his reaction to this murder. At first glance the work appears to be a splash of blood like the one in this killing, but, close up, the composition reveals itself as meticulous floral motifs typical of the art of miniature painting which the artist teaches. This work has echoes in another piece which was presented at the 10th Biennale of Sharjah, Blessing upon the land of my love, in which he develops an installation in a similar modus operandi, this time referring to a suicide bombing that took place in the market the artist goes to. These distinctive works confront us with the same feeling the artist had confronted with such violence, here Imran Qureshi poetically attempts to find a way to expiate these violent deaths and suggest their impacts on the political and social situation in Pakistan.","Imran Qureshi associates the aesthetic of Pakistani miniatures with political subjects on Pakistan toying with the public’s response to this type of painting which has precious and ancestral nature. Produced between 2006 and 2009, the Moderate Enlightenment series corresponds to this endeavor as he constructs these images on folkloric and traditional backgrounds and adds contemporary elements on the painted figure, often in the clothing codes (camouflage pants, sports shoes, umbrella …). This practice offers the artist’s viewpoint on contemporary Pakistan where friction between tradition and modernity and conflict are omnipresent.     Imran Qureshi was born in 1972 in Hyderâbâd, Pakistan.

Bettina Pousttchi,"For Bettina Poutsttchi’s large-format, site-specific photographic work Echo (2009–10), the four exterior walls of the Temporäre Kunsthalle Berlin were covered with a digitally edited collage of archival images of the glass-and-steel facade of the Palast der Republik (Palace of the Republic), which had once been located nearby. That milestone of late East European modernism was completed in 1976. It served as the seat for the Volkskammer—the parliament of the German Democratic Republic (GDR). After the fall of the Berlin Wall, the building lost its political purpose and was used for cultural initiatives. After a long political discussion, the building was demolished in 2009 to make room for the reconstruction of Berlin’s eighteenth-century Stadtschloss (City castle). With the aid of photography, Bettina Pousttchi rebuilt the Palace of the Republic, the historically important building in the immediate vicinity of the demolition site, thus raising questions of the eternal cycle of catastrophe, destruction, and reconstruction in Berlin.  Echo is a photographic work of an altered reality that is implemented in public space. The series of twenty-four color photographs was taken during the six-month presentation of Echo, offering a diverse portrait of this installation in the middle of the iconic buildings that surround it. With Echo, the artist altered the physical reality of the Berlin Schlossplatz through photographic means. By photographing it, she achieves another reality that crosses between architecture, sculpture, and photography in a very exciting way. A selection of the Echo photos were shown in her solo show at the Kunsthalle Basel in 2011. The proposal is to purchase a pair of photos showing the building at different times of the year and looking in different directions evoking different aspects of temporality and politics through the seasons and architecture.","In recent years Bettina Pousttchi’s work has dealt with themes related to memory, time and history and she is particularly interested in the consequences of the fall of the Berlin Wall. She makes sculpture, frequently made from crowd control barriers, video installations and photographs. She describes her work as coming out of photography. She also has an strong interest in architecture and its historical consequences. She was born in 1971 and studied in Dusseldorf under Rosemarie Trockel and Gerhard Merz. Like Amy Siegel, Pousttchi explores the relationship of Berlin’s Cold War past to its present in revealing ways.

Ciprian Muresan,"Ciprian Muresan asked a group of protagonists to wear a monk’s robe and copy a certain number of artworks and texts from exhibition catalogues. Here it is no longer the Bible that is reproduced but works by Malevich, Mondrian, Beuys, Duchamp. These artists represent a certain form of utopia in art and are themselves quasi-mythical figures. The fact that they are copying these works from a catalogue reproducing works by Elaine Sturtevant who in turn has appropriated work by other artists (mostly works made by men) creates an even greater distancing in the actions of these copying monks.  The authenticity of the artist’s gesture defended by Modernism is rejected and recalls the status of the artist during the Communist era. This also considers this post-Communist era in which artists easily enter the economic system of the art market in today’s globalized world and proposes an ironic comment on the diffusion of images in this internet age. Rather like in the work by Mladen Stilinovic, this is acts as an interrogation on the loss of meaning of certain icons in Western art, a questioning of the negative and positive consequences of a meticulous repetition of the past.","Ciprian Muresan appropriates historical, political, social and cultural (essentially artistic, literary and cinematographic) references which he re-contextualizes. He analyzes the mechanisms de diffusion of culture, the ambivalent relations between the memory of recent history and the experience of current realities, as well as the relations between political power, religious power and civil society. With simple gestures, themes and methods borrowed from popular culture, he tackles art in an expiatory manner, returning importance to personal expression and experience. Ciprian Muresan belongs to the generation after the fall of the former Communist regime who deal the aftermath of political and social history of his country, in a post-conceptual mode, without necessarily inscribing it within the traditional East/West opposition. Instead, on the contrary, he approaches this history as an integral part of a larger whole, and is interested in questions linked to the disturbances in contemporary society following the declining of Modernist utopias and in the impact of new technologies on our visual culture.

Igor Grubic,"366 Liberation Rituals is a series that gathers a number of actions related to the artist’s micro-politics. They materialize as a plurality of pointers that destabilize reality and interrogate our outlook on the political historicity of former Yugoslavia. These actions were realized over the course of the year the artist turned forty and revolved for one part around the revolutionary movement of 1968 and on the other on the informal group called Grupa šestorice autora (Group of Six Authors)* which was active in Zagreb between 1975 and 1979. Each group of images refers to a short precise action and the label documents the artist’s gesture, as well as the context in which it was done. *Mladen Stilinovic, Zeljko Jerman, Boris Demur, Fedomir Vucemilovic, Sven Stilinovic, and Vlado Martek.","Igor Grubic has developed his artistic practice as an activist. He became known in 1998 through an action in which he paid homage to the RED PERISTYL group who had painted the ground in front of Diocletian’s Palace in Split in 1968 in an act of provocation directed towards the Communist party. Thirty years later, he reactivated this gesture as a response to a different context in which nationalism and corruption are appearing in different countries of the former Communist bloc experiencing a period of transition.

Lydia Gifford,"Lydia Gifford composes her work between pictorial expression and its inscription within an exhibition space. This particular approach implies the performative aspect of her in situ painting. The artist takes the entire environment into consideration from the canvas to the exhibition walls. Time and attention are required to allow the subtleties of the work to reveal themselves in all their complexities in order to find a focal distance which is appropriate to experience the composition. A white wall, a vibrant canvas, disparate elements as  punctuation, and the pictorial gesture that continue on the wall on which it becomes inscribed in an echo with the canvas. She explains that: “There is a subtle balance between impulse and action. Actions leave traces, painting always initially carries the mark of the body, of an explosive gesture.” Intimate and played out in the exhibition space, the artist’s work endangers its own apparatus on the occasion of every presentation and thus renews the viewpoints in a perpetual dialogue between the work, the place and the audience.  Warder is on the limit of achievement and creates a tension with the exhibition space that fundamentally participates in its evolution. The artist proposes an intimate sensory experience by drawing attention to the vibratile nature of the context and the marking of her gesture. She states that in her work: “Painting allows me to transpose boundaries”. In the painting tradition that Gifford responds to Turner’s works are haunted by fog which diffuses light: she brings this up to date with her incisive question of defining a territory to cultivate. Her work alludes to landscape, questions the appearing of a work of art and its existence, the trace of its emergence, the vitality of the initial thrust.",Lydia Gifford was born in 1979.

Mike Cooter,"Forensic Poster was first realized in 2006 and reactivated in 2011; its making consisted of the artist visiting the London School of Criminology and corresponding with the interim director there in order to reproduce a poster by memory. This piece of work is symptomatic of Cooter’s projects which are often arduous enterprises littered with pitfalls, since they imply prospecting and collaborating with third parties whose will determine the success of the project.   Forensic Poster consists of a letter, emails and a gouache which translates the artist’s attempt to recreate a poster glimpsed at in one of the study halls of the London Police Department of Forensic Medicine. Against a blood red background, the drawing simulates a manuscript note that has been pinned to the wall with a giant nail which carries the inscription: “Nail em”. At the bottom of the image, the injunction is completed by “With Good Forensics”. The dry formal rendering reinforces the smooth and aggressive message so that the spectator grasps that it caught the artist’s full attention. The rationale for the presence of the correspondence as part of the work isn’t so not much to allow the confrontation between his memory and the original, but to show his dialogue with London Forensics Police.  Mike Cooter’s  practice interrogates the place of the artist in society and his implication in reality, indeed in most of his projects he works with third parties et integrates them into the artistic process.","Mike Cooter’s practice interrogates the place of the artist in society and his implication in reality, indeed in most of his projects he works with third parties et integrates them into the artistic process.

Chia Wei Hsu,"Marshal Tie Jia (Turtle Island) explores the history of a tiny island off of the coast of Matsu in the Taiwan Strait that has been instrumental in the geopolitical relationships between China, Taiwan, and Japan. The Chinese frog deity, Marshal Tie Jia, is now exiled to the island where he is still revered by the Taiwanese people. The installation includes documentation of the artist’s correspondence with the frog deity placed upon an altar, while the video explores both Marshal’s birthplace in China and his current home on Turtle Island. The video slowly zooms out from a fabricated version of Marshal’s former temple, which was dismantled then rebuilt on another island by dictator Chiang Kai-Shek when he retreated to Taiwan. As the video zooms out, it reveals the edges of the green screen, calling attention to the nation state’s production of the mythological narratives that play a persistent role in forming cultural identities. Image, text, and installation obscure the lines between truth and myth to establish a new mythology of representation.","Chia Wei Hsu makes site-specific video installations that explore memory and cultural identity by interfering with distinctions between reality and fiction and layering past and present.

On the left side, the artist is filmed in a sparse, red room with his tongue nailed onto a red table. With Lim’s freedom of movement and speech limited, the viewer focuses on the facial expressions of the artist as different streams of thoughts and realizations enter his mind. The screen on the right side features ethnographic footage of a Thaipusam ritual, a Hindu festival observed in Malaysia, where devotees repay prayers fulfilled by piercing their bodies with hooks in order to carry a decorated wooden arc called kavadi, or burden. Though the left screen shows an artist in a minimalist space and the right side depicts a fervent, ornate ritual context, both situations are liminal zones that emphasize the visual and sensorial relationship between pain and spirituality through close up shots of facial expressions. While an artist silenced is left to face his thoughts, prayers answered are repaid in sacred pain drummed on with cymbals.","H. H. Lim is a Neo-conceptual artist living and working in Rome since 1976. He works in various media, including painting, installation and performance.

Nalini Malani,"Memory: Record/Erase is a stop-motion animation by Nalini Malani based on ‘The Job,’ a short story by celebrated German poet and playwright Bertolt Brecht. Brecht’s story follows a poverty-stricken family during the German depression, as the central character, Frau Hausmann, is forced to impersonate her late husband to procure his job as a nightwatchman to support her two children. Despite her exceptional performance during the job, and even after receiving public commendation for catching a thief, when eventually her identity is discovered during a factory accident she is forced into a precarious existence where she resorts to selling herself to get by. Malini’s interpretation is comprised by drawings on parchment paper that suddenly appear, mutate, and subsequently vanish. Beyond referencing a glaring injustice and highlighting the arbitrary division of labour between genders, Malani poetically alludes to the fragile and ephemeral nature of our identities, our memory and more broadly our humanity. Like the marks on the paper, Malani meditates on the ease with which our lives can suddenly become undone.","Nalini Malani is a leading contemporary artist from India whose work looks critically at issues of gender, race, geopolitics, and the impact of consumer culture amidst rampant globalization. Working across painting, drawing, installation, animation, video and theater, Malani’s practice is characterized by its political bite, and, as described by the artist, for having an ‘internationalist’ perspective of global issues. Malani came to prominence in the 1980s through pioneering work that brought Feminist issues to the fore, courageously addressing the fatal place of women in Indian society. Highlight the violent legacy of colonialism has been a central concern, especially due to how she experienced it firsthand as a child and refugee during the partition of India. Formally, her work has borrowed imagery from Hindu as well as Greek mythology, and is characterized by a distinct combination of abstraction and figuration. From the 90s onwards her focus shifted towards theater and immersive installation pieces that incorporate video or hand-drawn animation while dealing with similar subject matter.",Memory: Record/Erase,Asia,"['occupation.n.01', 'paper.n.01', 'identity.n.01', 'memory.n.01', 'factory.n.01', 'narrative.n.01', 'ephemeral.s.01', 'animation.n.01', 'being.n.01', 'late.a.01', 'short.a.01', 'celebrated.s.01', 'interpretation.n.01', 'child.n.01', 'cardinal.s.01', 'family.n.01', 'public.a.01', 'establish.v.08', 'nature.n.01', 'fictional_character.n.01', 'drawing.n.01', 'performance.n.01', 'life.n.01']","['sex.n.04', 'labor.n.01', 'depression.n.01', 'memory.n.01', 'identity.n.01', 'animation.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/nalini_malani_memory_web.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/nalini_malani_memory_web-300x215.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/memory-recorderase/,"['Individual_Personal/14.653291153291157', 'Material_Physical/4.293040293040293', 'Society/4.228937728937729']","['Individual_Personal', 'Material_Physical', 'Society']",23.17526917526918,"['Identity/6.567210567210568', 'Materiality/3.293040293040293', 'Body/2.857142857142857']","['Identity', 'Materiality', 'Body']",12.717393717393719,"['Individual_Personal/29.081413357883953', 'Cultural/26.892937781173085', 'Material_Physical/18.59398671503935']","['Individual_Personal', 'Cultural', 'Material_Physical']",74.56833785409638,"['Materiality/10.037595737595739', 'Fantasy/7.585398098633393', 'Spirituality/7.388455988455989']","['Materiality', 'Fantasy', 'Spirituality']",25.01144982468512,0.6666666666666666,0.3333333333333333

Asli Çavusoglu,"Future Tense (2017), a 16-page diary, is a project in the form of a newspaper that brings together 50 oracles by people from various political opinions and ethnicities who consulted sand, lead, tarot cards, coffee grounds, blank sheets of A4 paper, dreams, water, clairvoyance, astrology, pendulums and horoscopes in order to reveal the point that Turkey has reached in news casting.  The 2016 coup d’etat led to the closure of many news sources and the incarceration of writers and journalists. Following the growing censorship and shift away from the rule of law, the number of fortunetellers and astrologers is steadily increasing. Now invited to newscasts as figures of authority, they have become the least likely to be affected by oppression and censorship. The fortune tellers have become more politically engaged, warning of bombs while looking at the stars, providing dates for a possible rebellion based on Mars’ position. As populism, a lack of empathy and discrimination reached new extremes both in the world and in Turkey. Future Tense challenges our information habits by mixing propaganda, news and clairvoyance.","Asli Çavusoglu’s projects examine how cultural and historical facts are transformed, represented, and interpreted by individuals.

Irony and self-reflectivity are central themes for her work, which explores feminist issues, tracks patterns of microhistory, is socially engaged, and can be political and escapist all at once.  Self-reflexivity is present in her work, and for several years she has collected stories and personal experiences provoked by the political and humanitarian crises in Syria and, more broadly, in the Middle East.","My specialty was to make a peasants’ haircut, but they obliged me work till midnight often",Middle East & Africa,"['interview.n.01', 'conversation.n.01', 'relationship.n.01', 'dialogue.n.01', 'history.n.01', 'documentary.a.01', 'write.v.01', 'corporate.s.03', 'physical.a.01', 'community.n.01', 'series.n.01', 'personal.a.01', 'photography.n.01', 'state.n.04', 'moment.n.01', 'woman.n.01', 'context.n.01', 'subject.n.01', 'drawing.n.01', 'practice.n.01', 'ocular.a.02', 'political.a.01', 'narrative.n.01', 'space.n.01', 'time.n.01']","['refugee.n.01', 'trauma.n.02', 'war.n.01', 'community.n.01', 'supplanting.n.01', 'fabric.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/MS_3_My-speciality-was-to-make-a-peasants-haircut-but-they-obliged-me-work-till-midnight-often-2015-2017_hand-and-machine-stitched-embroidery_72x86cm.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/MS_3_My-speciality-was-to-make-a-peasants-haircut-but-they-obliged-me-work-till-midnight-often-2015-2017_hand-and-machine-stitched-embroidery_72x86cm-300x200.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/my-specialty-was-to-make-a-peasants-haircut-but-they-obliged-me-work-till-midnight-often/,"['Society/12.820324283559579', 'Cultural/6.384615384615384', 'Politics/4.3076923076923075']","['Society', 'Cultural', 'Politics']",23.51263197586727,"['Urbanization/3.230769230769231', 'War/2.75', 'Violence/2.6985294117647056']","['Urbanization', 'War', 'Violence']",8.679298642533936,"['Cultural/16.19446299314721', 'Society/15.448096674567266', 'Individual_Personal/7.283516483516483']","['Cultural', 'Society', 'Individual_Personal']",38.92607615123096,"['Arts/4.5473684210526315', 'Language/3.8461538461538463', 'History/3.6083333333333334']","['Arts', 'Language', 'History']",12.001855600539812,0.6666666666666666,0.0
Thao-Nguyên Phan,"Tropical Siesta begins in a rural landscape of Vietnam. Very quickly, painted images of students sleeping on their school benches appear. A text speaking of how the communist regime has placed agriculture at the center of its economy reads alongside the images. The script tells of how children have access to only one book History of the Kingdom of Tonkin (1650) by Alexandre de Rhodes, a French Jesuit missionary. In different scenes, children interpret the stories of the book to escape from reality. The landscape of Tropical Siesta recalls the dark period of Communism during which many people were deported or executed— a history that was not written, the amnesia of a people to which the innocence of children respond.","Thao-Nguyên Phan is a multimedia artist who lives and works in Ho Chi Minh City.

Natan Lawson,"abstractedUntitled (Bubbles) is ‘printed’ using a customized plotter, rigged to hold a paint marker with a ball-bearing tip, which is drained and refilled with a new color of acrylic paint, layered one atop another. While outward appearances suggest a painting (and the canvas substrate reinforces this) the implement resembles a ball-point pen used in drawing. So it is both painting and drawing. The results of the process are precise linear marks, that cross the entirety of the surface, appearing like a topographic map—an abstracted surface suggestive of something recognizable. The colors and texture of the work resembles hand-dyed fabric, akin to the low-resolution imagery of a woven rug. In this way, the form and content echo the hybrid process of production. The image in Untitled (Bubbles) is the result of the artist layering photo and found material in the computer, before sending coordinates to the plotter which renders it, with some manual intervention of the canvas during the process. Lawson thinks of the process as related to a computerized jacquard loom, where colored textile yarns are woven.","After receiving a BFA in Painting, from RISD, Lawson returned to his home city of Baltimore to live and work. Lawson makes all of his artwork with a computer controlled plotter originally designed to cut vinyl, which has been modified to produce marks with a variety of implements. Producing hybrid artworks at the intersection of drawing and painting, Lawson’s work resides at another intersection, between hand-made and computer processed. While he continues to experiment with new instruments (paint brushes, felt tip markers, airbrush etc.), the linear-fill of color across the surface is akin to his past work with silk-screen printing, often layering many colors to produce a unique final work. Lawson uses found imagery, which is scanned and edited in digital form.

Following this, a kind of natural phenomena appeared where smoke would mix with aerosols in a billowing spectacle. The environment is strongly polluted and the land could not be farmed. Because of poor technology, the factory didn’t earn enough benefit to operate fully; therefore, their income is very low. Everyone has no choice but to struggle through this strange phenomenon—this vicious cycle.  The Assembly Line series examines the complex relationships between man and machine, management and labor, the individual and the society, as well as the questions of modernity. Li Xiaofei uses his unique documentary technique to combine interviews and scenery in the film. Compared to Li Xiaofei’s other films, Argentum has more complex narrative. Through different perspectives, the workers, the factory owner, the officers, Li Xiaofei presents the dilemma of the desire of the growth of economy and the repercussions on the natural environment, which is the biggest problem of the development of today’s villages in China.","Li Xiaofei initiated Assembly Line in 2010, an ongoing project that records industrialized social change not only China, but as it occurs internationally. “Jindu” Gold City, “Yindu” Silver City, “Tongdu” Copper City, and “Niedu” Nickel City are just few of the many cities in China named after the minerals and metals that are mined and produced there. Li Xiaofei travelled across the country to shoot over 100 factories across China, while initiating dialogue and exchange with people of different positions within the assembly line. Through this documentation process, Li Xiaofei explores what lies beyond the orderliness of the assembly line, the capitalist factory, consumer society, social progress and social morals—the reality of people living in a highly systematic and institutionalized environment. He employed a “real time” shooting technique which was difficult to control, combined with the language of documentary and a fragmented interwoven approach to create a mutual restructuring and a transformation of the relationship between man and machine, in essence to reconstruct an illusory reality.",Argentum,Asia,"['factory.n.01', 'economy.n.01', 'complex.a.01', 'natural.a.01', 'environment.n.01', 'movie.n.01', 'mountain.n.01', 'interview.n.01', 'documentary.n.01', 'phenomenon.n.01', 'town.n.01', 'shoot.v.01', 'district.n.01', 'strange.a.01', 'machine.n.01', 'worker.n.01', 'development.n.01', 'china.n.01', 'technology.n.01', 'land.n.01', 'technique.n.01', 'desire.n.01', 'government.n.01', 'series.n.01', 'person.n.01']","['industrialization.n.01', 'exploitation.n.02', 'pollution.n.01', 'labor.n.01', 'contamination.n.03', 'industry.n.02']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_Argentum-05_web.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_Argentum-05_web-300x169.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/argentum/,"['Society/20.358227771540466', 'Material_Physical/7.00261843867982', 'Politics/4.107692307692308']","['Society', 'Material_Physical', 'Politics']",31.468538517912595,"['Economy/10.528654970760233', 'Environmental/6.179089026915114', 'Colonization/3.294707356626861']","['Economy', 'Environmental', 'Colonization']",20.00245135430221,"['Material_Physical/25.096820482579005', 'Society/22.38270095917155', 'Cultural/21.579154995331468']","['Material_Physical', 'Society', 'Cultural']",69.05867643708203,"['Land/16.904792902316125', 'Emotion/12.381618381618384', 'Urbanization/11.891772280007576']","['Land', 'Emotion', 'Urbanization']",41.178183563942085,0.6666666666666666,0.0

Wong Ping,"His madcap video, Wong Ping’s Fables 1, might at first appear to resemble a crazy screensaver. Grid-like patterns allude to the work’s deep digital structure, while comic-book imagery illustrates a set of curious moral parables. The video tells the story of Elephant, an intellectual who discovers second sight; Chicken, a police officer with Tourette Syndrome who accidentally kills his family; and Tree, a bus passenger forced to confront his darkest fears. They are flawed characters, and Ping annotates each of their stories with a short critical maxim. The artist wrote: “The tradition of fables providing a maxim is like the tradition of the artist’s statement… It tries to explain work that often doesn’t need it. But in the internet era, maybe we don’t have the time for long fairy tales—we want everything to be short and pithy.”","Working with videos, Wong Ping’s dreamlike narratives tell strange tales that might be difficult to watch, were they not rendered in animated form. The visual and auditory narrations often very explicitly touch upon sex, politics and social relations.

Shi Guowei,"Through this hand-painting process, Shi Guowei created Manufactured Landscape. At first glance, the painting appears from afar as a landscape photograph. Yet, upon closer attention, the work reveals itself as a landscape painting thoroughly hand-colored by the artist onto a photograph. Contrasting with editing techniques of digital photography available today thanks to technology, this process of layering and color-saturation creates an ambiguous sense of time and space, rather than a realistic one. As a consequence, the landscape appears uncanny and almost threatening. In doing so, the work emphasizes the idea of “nature” as a constructed concept by men while fostering greater awareness of the role men play in shaping and destroying the natural world. The work also challenges traditional norms in landscape painting in China, which according to Chinese tradition, often rendered landscapes in the form of a vertical scroll rather than Shi Guowei’s horizontal or square work.","Shi Guowei is concerned with notions of historical and cultural traditions as they relate to current socio-political issues. Working mainly with photography, the artist is best known for his works that examine the complex issues that arise when traditional Chinese culture collides with more recent social, artistic, and political realities, both of China and beyond. Shi’s process of hand-coloring photographs is influenced by traditional hand painting techniques in China. Painters developed this traditional technique to create a heightened sense of depth, color, and realism behind each work. To create these works, the artist first took a digital black-and-white photograph of a landscape significant to him and then developed the print onto photographic paper. From memory, the artist finally applied paint, carefully and thoroughly by hand, to add color.",Manufactured Landscape,Asia,"['landscape.n.01', 'procedure.n.01', 'glance.n.01', 'chinese.a.01', 'china.n.01', 'photograph.n.01', 'technology.n.01', 'technique.n.01', 'digital.a.01', 'concept.n.01', 'attention.n.01', 'traditional.a.01', 'natural.a.01', 'tradition.n.01', 'photography.n.01', 'function.n.03', 'construct.v.01', 'consequence.n.01', 'idea.n.01', 'nature.n.01', 'sense.n.01', 'space.n.01', 'form.n.01', 'time.n.01']","['delusion.n.03', 'engineering.n.02', 'nature.n.03', 'naturalism.n.02', 'landscape.n.01', 'acculturation.n.02']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Shi-Guowei-Manufactured-Landscape-2015-hand-colored-black-and-white-photo-150-x-150cm-3AP1_Web.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Shi-Guowei-Manufactured-Landscape-2015-hand-colored-black-and-white-photo-150-x-150cm-3AP1_Web-300x300.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/manufactured-landscape/,"['Cultural/17.964366515837106', 'Individual_Personal/13.353041729512324', 'Material_Physical/8.50940170940171']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Material_Physical']",39.82680995475114,"['Mind/6.4214177978883855', 'Arts/4.906862745098039', 'Technology/4.541666666666666']","['Mind', 'Arts', 'Technology']",15.86994720965309,"['Individual_Personal/38.566142354377654', 'Cultural/33.92466677629217', 'Material_Physical/14.947533168585801']","['Individual_Personal', 'Cultural', 'Material_Physical']",87.43834229925562,"['Mind/12.585347985347983', 'Values/11.70851109674639', 'Culture/11.303296703296704']","['Mind', 'Values', 'Culture']",35.597155785391074,1.0,0.3333333333333333
Ren Zi,To the Cardinal Gods: Central Axial Consecration (Site 6) is from a 2017 series artist Red Zi made during a residency in the Arctic Circle.,"Ren Zi turned to art after having spent his working life in the business of words (advertising). He has channeled the mutative influences of popular culture, science and the multi-cultural strains that sift through the consciousness of his country. In his work, he focuses on the role memory plays in our sense of identity and of the world. This comes from having majored in psychology and from the sense of loss that grew out of growing up in a country whose past has all but been erased.

Doug Aitken,"The version of Frontier acquired by the Kadist Collection consists of a single-channel video, adapted from the monumental installation and performance that Aitken presented in Rome, by the Tiber River, in 2009. In this film, Aiken’s allusion to “the frontier” and iconic imagery like the cowboy suggest that the American West Coast as a cultural construction. These notions are reinforced by two key elements in the film: its protagonist, the iconic West Coast artist Ed Ruscha, and its reference to the cinematic and the experience of the movie theater. The film is structured as a journey in time, from day to night. The completed film was shot in different places around the globe, including Los Angeles, Rome, South Africa, and Israel, which suggests the blurring boundaries of the unknown and emphasizes both fictive and real landscapes.","Doug Aitken’s work started to draw international attention when his installation Electric Earth earned the International Prize at the 1999 Venice Biennale, which was organized by renowned Swiss curator Harald Szeemann. Interested in breaking conventional narratives, Aitken emphasizes circularity and non-linearity in his monumental site-specific installations. This monumentality is usually expressed in Aitken’s tendency to combine apparently disconnected fragments in order to create epic films. Although this aspect of his work differs from the all-encompassing wholes sought by modernism, Aitken’s films play with the imaginary and surreal in a way that flirts with  the notion of utopia. The artist uses pop culture and, especially, the film industry as sources for his compelling and immersive environments.

Alexis Smith,"Iron Sorrows (1990) brings together what are for Alexis Smith common motifs and materials such as scavenged and repurposed metal, and street signage. Iron is one of nature’s most abundant metals. Smith, a philosopher of human detritus and poetic associations, presents it in this work as simultaneously everywhere yet paradoxically forgotten, lost in the heaps of refuse that fill junkyards and vacant lots. She thereby recalls and reclaims something important and elemental—indeed, a material that is integral to the physical fabric of culture and society, one that we associate with incorruptibility and malleability simultaneously.","At a moment when Minimalism and Conceptual Art collided, Southern California-based Alexis Smith began working with discarded street signs, matchbooks, movie posters, and other detritus to become one of the pioneers of conceptual assemblage. Her cryptic comments on the cloudy morality of American culture are derived from pop cultural references including political figures like Richard Nixon, Hollywood films, and pop musicians.

Sarah Navqi,"A “Mata ni pachedi” is a piece of cloth that constitutes the temple of a goddess. Also known as the “kalamkari” (a hand-painted or block-printed cotton textile), it owes its similarity to this technique practiced in Southern India. Mata ni pachedi (literally translates to “behind the mother goddess”) originates from the nomadic Vaghari community of Gujarat who, upon being barred from entering Hindu temples, made their own mobile shrines with depictions of the Mother Goddess on cloth. This sacred art form is today universally revered and used in decorating temples and shrines with narrative illustrations of religious stories. Conceived by Naqvi with master pachedi craftsman Chandrakanth Chitara, the work Yatra deals with the Ram Leela procession, which is a staged re-enactment of the ancient Hindu epic Ramayana, through the Muslim neighbourhoods of Ahmedabad, India. The procession has long been used by Hindu nationalist groups to stir communal tensions between Hindus and Muslims in a city infamous for its violent religious riots. The work examines this moment of tension, and the layered histories it embodies.","Sarah Naqvi places emphasis on the importance of being comfortable in our own bodies. She is known for her unconventional use of materials, medium and technique such as fabric manipulation, dyeing and appliqué on unusual materials such as sanitary napkins, bra cups and tampons. Naqvi studied textile design at The National Institute of Design in Ahmedabad and works with art based activism and material realities.

John Lucas and Claudia Rankine,"In Stamped, filmmaker and photographer John Lucas and writer Claudia Rankine collaborative capture photographs of dyed blonde hair, as seen on the heads of strangers and acquaintances. These images—zoomed in and cropped—are framed as still images and also transposed onto real postage stamps. The stamp, a form of currency with inherent mobility, becomes a metaphor for questioning identity.   Historically, blondness has been a signifier for desirability and beauty. In Sheet 5, the repetition of blonde hair speaks to “purity” and whiteness like no other bodily attribute except, perhaps, blue eyes. In the twenty-first century, blondness is the look desired by the American president, pop stars, rappers, television announcers, Hollywood celebrities, the boy next door, and some, though not all, Asian Americans, African Americans, white Americans, Arab Americans, and LatinX Americans. The desirability of blonde hair has no genre boundaries, no pronoun limitation, and no class limit. Whether one is a bottle blonde or natural, blondness is ubiquitous.","John Lucas and Claudia Rankine are interdisciplinary thinkers committed to exploring the nuances of race and power in our daily lives. This collaborative work is an early foray into visual art and represents a modest way to bring Kadist closer to their important dialogue and orbit.

Charles Lim,"SEA STATE is a research project that has spanned 13 years of the artist and filmmakers practice. Charles Lim’s multimedia project takes the sea as its focal point. Here, the sea is treated as a mapped resource, an abstract commodity, and an entity through which strategic nation-building, as well as economical and political pursuits, are built. A former Olympic sailor, Lim’s lifelong engagement with the sea reveals the invisible politics of Singapore’s relationship with the ocean as a political entity, a commodity and an imaginary boundary. The project’s early stages studied Singapore’s coastal ecology and the effects of industrial activities, while recent iterations such as SEA STATE, examine Singapore’s expansion through land reclamation and the ongoing quest to make the finite, infinite.  In SEA STATE 6: Capsize Lim takes the viewer down the Jurong Rock Caverns in Singapore, a massive underground infrastructure for oil and fuel storage, built to support the commercial operations of oil traders, petrochemical ventures and manufacturing industries in the area. The first of its kind in Southeast Asia. Located at a depth of 130 meters beneath the Banyan Basin on Jurong Island, the Caverns provide infrastructural support to the petrochemical industry that operates on Singapore’s Jurong Island, a cluster of islets reclaimed into one major island and connected to the mainland in the 1980s. When it opened in 2014, Phase 1 of the caverns was holding some 1.47 million cubic meters of oil storage tanks. This is about the size of 600 Olympic swimming pools. The volume of undersea rocks excavated from Phase 1 equals 1.8 million cubic metres, enough to fill 1,400 Olympic swimming pools. In the opening scenes, we see the artist sailing, his boat ultimately capsizing, leading us to discover the Jurong Rock Caverns. Viewers are guided down a still-empty cavern, where there is ongoing construction and workers toil away to the comforting melody of a Malay song and the sailing boat appears as the metaphor of a possible escape. This piece was first exhibited in the Venice Biennale 2015 when the artist represented Singapore.","Charles Lim’s work encompasses film, installation, sound, recorded conversations, text, drawing, and photography.

Etel Adnan and Lynn Marie Kirby,"In conjunction with KADIST’s 2017 exhibition If Not Apollo, the Breeze, artist and filmmaker Lynn Marie Kirby performed Transmissions, a video and live reading created with longtime collaborator Etel Adnan. Inspired by time spent together in Paris, the piece incorporated open-ended conversation about the oracle, Mount Tamalpais (a subject of long-standing fascination for Adnan and the subject of hundreds of works), and a suite of collaborative drawings.  The drawings, made in India ink and created spontaneously, are remarkable evidence of two lives, minds, and hands in dialogue. Executed simply and without fuss, they cut to the core of memory and mark-making across time. Though Adnan, 93, is not able to physically travel, the works represent a wandering–if homebound–spirit.","Visual artist, poet, and essayist Etel Adnan writes what must be communicated through language, and paints what cannot. While her earliest paintings favored pure abstraction, she is perhaps best known for her landscape works inspired by her long obsession with Mount Tamalpais. Her work has been published and displayed around the world.  Moving between narratives of geographic and domestic landscapes, Lynn Marie Kirby explores traces of a human presence through the residue of light, history, and listening. With a background in cinema and conceptual performance, she works with shifting recording technologies, creating film/video hybrids, drawings, and installations that become records of certain times and places. Using methods such as site interruption, writing, and collaboration, her projects manifest at the intersection of events and archives, looking at the links between public and private, biographical and system ecologies.",Collaborative Mt.

Abel Rodríguez,"Abel Rodríguez’s precise botanical illustrations, such as Terraza Alta V, are drawn from memory and knowledge acquired through oral traditions; they are the visions of someone who sees the potential of plants as food, material for dwellings and clothing, and for use in sacred rites. Often, his “botanical plates” include written information like the color and taste of the bark, the season in which it blooms, where it grows and at what time of the year, both in his native Muinane language and in Spanish. For example, the drawing Ciclo anual del bosque de la vega (Seasonal changes in the flooded rainforest) is a calendar tracking the changing appearance and life of the inundated forest. And the work Árbol de la vida y de la abundancia (Tree of life and abundance) tells the story of the creation of the jungle and the origin of the world.  Untrained in illustration or writing, Rodríguez began drawing the forest from memory. From giant trees to small rodents, his vividly detailed illustrations are deeply time-specific. At a glance, many of his pencil and ink landscapes appear to be the same. But after extended observation one notices that every element, from leaf shapes to animal locations to flowers, change in accordance with the month and season the artist is depicting. For Rodríguez, an internationally recognized plant expert, these drawings are a means of recovering and sharing his knowledge of plants of the Amazon gained through teachings from his grandfather, a healer, and nearly seventy years of observation.","“Guihu,” as Abel Rodríguez  was originally known, was born in the headwaters of the Cahuinarí River in the Colombian Amazon, and raised by the Muinane. His uncle, a sabedor (man of knowledge) taught him about plants. Years later, Carlos Rodríguez (a biologist who heads the Colombian branch of Tropenbos, a Dutch NGO whose mission is to study and protect the tropical jungle) needed local guides to assist Amazonian botany students to identify local plants. Guihu became one such guide, and he proved to be a true savant.  In the 1990s, Guihu—who by then had adopted the Western name Abel Rodríguez—moved to Bogotá, escaping violence in the jungle, and settled in one of the Colombian capital’s poverty-ridden peripheral neighborhoods. It was there that Carlos Rodríguez stumbled by chance into Abel and invited him to work again with Tropenbos as a specialist in plants, providing him with the tools to create botanical drawings.",Terraza Alta V,Americas,"['plant.n.01', 'cognition.n.01', 'memory.n.01', 'food.n.01', 'glance.n.01', 'pull.v.01', 'native.a.01', 'change.n.01', 'component.n.01', 'life.n.01', 'creation.n.01', 'appearance.n.01', 'tree.n.01', 'vision.n.01', 'location.n.01', 'write.v.01', 'tradition.n.01', 'language.n.01', 'color.n.01', 'beginning.n.04', 'shape.n.01', 'drawing.n.01', 'material.n.01', 'landscape.n.01', 'narrative.n.01']","['drawing.n.03', 'illustration.n.04', 'plant.n.02', 'vegetation.n.01', 'botany.n.02', 'jungle.n.03', 'memory.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Screen-Shot-2020-04-30-at-3.52.23-PM.png,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Screen-Shot-2020-04-30-at-3.52.23-PM-300x216.png,https://kadist.org/work/terraza-alta-v/,"['Cultural/12.00291783380019', 'Material_Physical/5.641332580463016', 'Individual_Personal/4.0255799755799755']","['Cultural', 'Material_Physical', 'Individual_Personal']",21.66983038984318,"['Arts/6.282843137254902', 'Design/2.42483660130719', 'Physics/2.4189723320158105']","['Arts', 'Design', 'Physics']",11.126652070577903,"['Cultural/33.23940226440227', 'Individual_Personal/32.77517776341306', 'Material_Physical/22.715873015873022']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Material_Physical']",88.73045304368836,"['Mind/14.979487179487183', 'Culture/11.434065934065936', 'Materiality/7.352747252747253']","['Mind', 'Culture', 'Materiality']",33.76630036630037,1.0,0.0
Thao-Nguyên Phan,"Untitled (Heads) by Phan Thao Nguyên, locates the jute plant as both the cause and witness of a tragic event. When Vietnamese farmers were forced to grow jute instead of rice during the Japanese occupation of then French Indochina from 1940–45, it led to large-scale famine and the death of two million Vietnamese. The form of the sculpture is inspired by the Ma Mot tree, a totemic tree constructed by Tai minorities in Northern Vietnam for religious purposes where objects such as animal bones and amulets are hung, representing a dead or evil spirit. The artist reincarnates the jute plant as a Ma Mot tree, hanging on its drooping branches are portraits of farmers whom she interviewed during the course of her research, in an attempt to create a ritual yet individualized space of healing from painful histories.","Thao-Nguyên Phan is a multimedia artist who lives and works in Ho Chi Minh City. She uses painting, installation, video and performance to depict historical events, narrative traditions and minor gestures that challenge received ideas and social conventions Through literature, philosophy, poetics, and daily life, she observes ambiguous issues in social convention, history and tradition.

Andrés Pereira Paz,"Juan III (Pescadores en una isla) is a series of embroideries made with fake pre-Columbian fabrics made by the Gonzales family, a three-generation family of pre-Columbian textile “forgers” based in Lima, Peru. The members of this family (grandfather, father, and son) all bear the name of Juan and makes replicas by hand using traditional methods nearly indistinguishable from the pieces made thousands of years ago.   A fake is something that purports to be what it is not, but the textiles made by the Gonzalez family openly intend to recreate those originally found at a necropolis in Peru in the 1920s. The necropolis held 420 bodies that had been mummified and wrapped in embroidered textiles in 200–300 BCE. These textiles were made by South American people over a thousand years before the rise of the Inca. They are brightly colored and show images of supernatural creatures or shamans who use their hands to hold severed human heads whilst their wings transport them like birds. But in the 1930s the Paracas Necropolis was massively looted and textiles began to appear on the international market within the decade. It is thought that the majority of the Paracas textiles in international collections were smuggled out of Peru during this time.  The fabric’s story offers a discussion on trafficking culture, the dearth of art historical scholarship on cultural materials, in particular the average knowledge of Andean culture before the Inca, and the questionable difference between fakes and forgeries from the real across the Americas. Tourists, collectors, and museums, wanted the ancient Americas, so locals made the ancient Americas, making fakes a feature of the pre-Columbian antiquities market since there’s been a pre-Columbian antiquities market. One could argue the textiles made by the Gonzales family is a contribution to preserve and revive the cultural heritage, long history, and soul of Paracas. These series of pieces serve as a tribute to them and this history.","Andrés Pereira Paz’s work regularly takes the form of textiles that explore the circulation of people and materials and how it affects national, regional and global imaginaries, revealing the construction of culture to be an ongoing and often contradictory process.   His work examines postcolonial issues from the perspective of the Andean region, particularly from his home country of Bolivia. The artist frequently references Andean art history, both from the pre-Columbian and colonial periods. He plays with this background and produces creative interpretations of contemporary Andean culture: the results are sometimes humorous, but always witty and incisive.",Juan III (Pescadores En Una Isla),Americas,"['fabric.n.01', 'market.n.01', 'family.n.01', 'ancient.s.01', 'united_states.n.01', 'cultural.a.01', 'culture.n.01', 'piece.n.01', 'father.n.01', 'method.n.01', 'cognition.n.01', 'keep.v.01', 'history.n.01', 'hands.n.01', 'animal.n.01', 'head.n.01', 'feature.n.01', 'traditional.a.01', 'american.a.01', 'series.n.01', 'museum.n.01', 'hand.n.01', 'real.a.01', 'historical.a.01', 'establish.v.08']","['embroidery.n.02', 'fake.n.01', 'counterfeit.n.01', 'anthropology.n.01', 'mythology.n.01', 'traffic.v.02']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-05-06-at-3.55.33-PM.png,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-05-06-at-3.55.33-PM-300x189.png,https://kadist.org/work/juan-iii-pescadores-en-una-isla/,"['Cultural/12.228846626369847', 'Material_Physical/4.685714285714286', 'Politics/2.4190476190476193']","['Cultural', 'Material_Physical', 'Politics']",19.333608531131752,"['Arts/3.9111111111111114', 'Technology/2.466666666666667', 'Media/2.447058823529412']","['Arts', 'Technology', 'Media']",8.82483660130719,"['Society/22.57371239871241', 'Cultural/22.23866982690513', 'Individual_Personal/16.282900596135892']","['Society', 'Cultural', 'Individual_Personal']",61.09528282175343,"['History/8.533119658119658', 'Culture/6.857142857142857', 'Mind/6.777777777777777']","['History', 'Culture', 'Mind']",22.168040293040292,0.3333333333333333,0.0
Agnieszka Kurant,"Placebo brings together a series of imaginary pharmaceuticals invented within the fictional narratives of literature and film. Displayed in a custom cabinet, these imaginary drugs are materialized as physical objects, packaged in meticulously designed boxes, listing dosage and description information along with references to the fictional source. Each box is filled with placebo tablets. The project is suggestive of the ways that fiction and popular culture affects how we experience reality. Placebos, or pills without active ingredients, can have powerful effects, and news scientific studies show that placebos can be used to treat some illnesses. For example, in some countries they are used by doctors to treat chronic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. Metaphorically, the work suggests the power of belief, and draws an association with the symbolic field of art.  The work might also be seen as an oblique reference to and comment on the often un-critical culture of over-the-counter prescription drug-use (and abuse) in the US.","Conceptual interdisciplinary artist, Agnieszka Kurant explores how complex social, economic and cultural systems can operate in ways that confuse distinctions between fiction and reality or nature and culture. She investigates “the economy of the invisible,” in which immaterial and imaginary entities, fictions, phantoms and emergent processes influence political and economic systems. Kurant probes the “unknown unknowns” of knowledge and the speculations and exploits of capitalism by integrating elements of science and philosophy, and analyzing certain phenomena—collective intelligence, emergence, virtual capital, immaterial and digital labor, evolution of memes, civilizations and social movements, artificial societies, energy circuits and the editing process—as political acts.

Jeremy Deller,"Beyond the White Walls, with a commentary written and spoken by Jeremy Deller, is often wryly amusing. The artist narrates the many projects he has completed or which are in progress beyond the gallery walls. It is beyond the gallery where Deller is at his most effective and where his art reaches out to and into people’s lives. The tape slide presentation shows the extensive range of Deller’s work. On one level it is documentation, on another level it is a work that investigates the nature of a work of art – is a social project a work of art? When does documentation become art? Can we accept the artist’s commentary at face value?  The artist acts as a historian or archivist of his own work but presents it in such a way that the archive is the work of art itself. Deller is at one and the same time artist, curator and cultural historian interested in the way popular culture and fine art abut each other. His art has the capacity to affect directly people’s lives by inserting it into the community and requiring the community’s participation.","Jeremy Deller is one of the leading British artists working in film and making projects that grow out of an interest in vox pop, giving vent to the views of ordinary people and focusing on ordinary people’s lives. He seeks the involvement of the common man in the making of his work as well as focusing on events that have had a major impact on people’s lives. His most famous piece is a film called the Battle of Orgreave (2001) in which he produced and filmed a reenactment of an infamous confrontation between striking miners and the police force during the fateful miners’ strike that took place during Margaret Thatcher’s first term in office in 1984. In Deller’s restaging many of the participants were miners and policemen who had been present at the original event. Prior to that in 1996 Deller produced a work called Acid Brass for which he commissioned a brass band from the northern community of Stockport that would normally play traditional and often Christian songs, to play acid house and techno rock tunes. Brass Bands were closely associated with the collieries that were under threat from the conservative government’s closure of the coalmines. For Deller the Miners’ strike and the rise of acid house music were the two most significant events of the period and he brought them together in this one piece. It is the mixing of traditions that makes his work so compelling. Deller went on to win the Turner Prize in 2004 and has continued to make works which investigate the interface between art and popular culture, normally with a strong political and social aspect, although often the works are funny and witty. In 2012 his solo exhibition at the Hayward Gallery was widely acclaimed.",Beyond the White Walls,Europe,"['documentation.n.01', 'degree.n.01', 'community.n.01', 'wall.n.01', 'undertaking.n.01', 'people.n.01', 'white.n.01', 'presentation.n.01', 'life.n.01', 'write.v.01', 'popular.a.01', 'nature.n.01', 'cultural.a.01', 'culture.n.01', 'social.a.01', 'time.n.01']","['gallery.n.03', 'elsewhere.r.01', 'archive.n.01', 'community.n.01', 'documentation.n.01', 'testimony.n.02']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/www.weheart.co_.uk-5d6feeef80742fab543b00ffc360cbff749cd34c_copie_bd.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/www.weheart.co_.uk-5d6feeef80742fab543b00ffc360cbff749cd34c_copie_bd-300x195.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/beyond-the-white-walls/,"['Society/4.492307692307692', 'Cultural/1.6527777777777777', 'Politics/0.7692307692307693']","['Society', 'Cultural', 'Politics']",6.914316239316239,"['Urbanization/1.6923076923076925', 'Community/1.0', 'History/1.0']","['Urbanization', 'Community', 'History']",3.6923076923076925,"['Society/14.488364413364417', 'Material_Physical/8.832478632478633', 'Individual_Personal/8.108771929824561']","['Society', 'Material_Physical', 'Individual_Personal']",31.42961497566761,"['Community/5.3090909090909095', 'Urbanization/4.2153846153846155', 'Economy/3.2750000000000004']","['Community', 'Urbanization', 'Economy']",12.799475524475525,0.3333333333333333,0.6666666666666666
Zhou Tao,"After Reality is a video by Zhou Tao, which was born out of his residency with the Kadist Foundation in Paris in 2012-13. Prior to arriving to the residency, the artist had begun filming in in Guangzhou, China, capturing footage of the lush vegetation from the semi-wild and semi-urbanized zones of Guangzhou’s urban fringe and a group of Dragon Boat rowers training in the adjacent river. As he arrived in Paris, he was confronted with the radical difference with which Europeans arrange and organize environments: the highly manicured cityscapes of Paris in stark contrast with the overgrown abundance of Guangzhou. Using the notion of “geometrical editing” Zhou Tao then worked to incorporate images shot in Paris to his previous editing, focusing on the idea of continuity in between spaces as means to create a third, imaginary space through film. Adding another layer of complexity, Zhou Tao also subtly appears performing in the footage among the scenes of rowers and farmers going by — either walking at a slightly slower pace behind them or assuming difficult stances amid the luxuriant vegetation. The result is a film that is untethered to space and confronts us to a kind of unhistorical time where background and stage, viewer and actor, fact and story line, documentation and representation are all superimposed interchanged. creating an alchemy that transforms ordinary surroundings into a theatre of mystery and wonder, which are rare to find.","There is no single entry to the practice of Zhou Tao, who combines video with photographs, drawings and built environments to challenge our perception of any singular or real narrative or space. Through subtle and humorous interactions with people, objects, and environments, and through an intuitive editing process that creates a montage of scenes from various locations to appear as one, Zhou Tao’s videos invite us to experience the multiple trajectories of reality—what he calls the “folding scenario” or the “zone with folds.” The spaces he depicts are often transitional or in between: edges of roads, a concrete underpass beneath a bridge, overgrown plants in forgotten areas inside cities are often the protagonists. Also focusing on the communities that inhabit these spaces, his work lacks narrative but is instead rooted in the gaze of his lens, moving around nature, urban scapes and their dwellers, almost as a form of documentary. For him, the use of video is not a deliberate choice of artistic language or medium, instead the operation of the camera is a way of being that blends itself with everyday life. As the artist describes it he is influenced by a consciousness in performance which is then viewed through the moving image: “my relationship with reality and with the filmed image.” In his thoughtful and speculative approach his camera is not simply a recording apparatus but an extension of his existence and his active participation in the environments. The images it produces are not just detached spectacles: they are the agents that reveal the theatrical details suffused in mundane life.",After Reality,Asia,"['paris.n.01', 'footage.n.01', 'space.n.01', 'theater.n.01', 'milieu.n.01', 'confront.v.01', 'river.n.01', 'complexity.n.01', 'shoot.v.01', 'bear.v.01', 'movie.n.01', 'documentation.n.01', 'phase.n.01', 'actor.n.01', 'china.n.01', 'contrast.n.01', 'layer.n.01', 'background.n.01', 'urban.a.01', 'environment.n.01', 'impression.n.01', 'consequence.n.01', 'representation.n.01', 'idea.n.01', 'world.n.03']","['garden.n.01', 'cross-cultural.a.01', 'nature.n.01', 'mystery.n.01', 'fanciful.s.02', 'overgrow.v.02']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/a7-1.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/a7-1-300x169.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/after-reality/,"['Material_Physical/2.423529411764706', 'Individual_Personal/1.6', 'Society/0.7777777777777778']","['Material_Physical', 'Individual_Personal', 'Society']",4.8013071895424835,"['Land/0.8235294117647058', 'Identity/0.8', 'Familial/0.8']","['Land', 'Identity', 'Familial']",2.423529411764706,"['Individual_Personal/39.77032967032968', 'Cultural/34.39743410184588', 'Material_Physical/15.339840860893492']","['Individual_Personal', 'Cultural', 'Material_Physical']",89.50760463306905,"['Mind/13.42051282051282', 'Culture/11.153846153846155', 'Values/10.894505494505495']","['Mind', 'Culture', 'Values']",35.46886446886447,0.6666666666666666,0.0

Jennifer West,"This work was filmed on the shores of Jelly Bowl beach in Carpinteria, California, after Jennifer West was taken by the sight of a coastal family home owned by surfer Andy Perry. After conversing with Perry, spending time in the site, and engaging with several other locals, West wanted to produce a film that documented this idyllic Californian lifestyle and that embodied the sense of joy, warmth and nostalgia that multiple generations of surfers and their families had shared in this site. In the footage we see a couple of silhouettes wrapped up in blankets as they watch their beloved ones surfing at dawn—including surfers Andy Perry, and siblings Makela, Alana and Zach Moore. Pure and enjoyable, the film is about the community that enlivens these shores on a daily basis. Dawn Surf Jellybowl approaches the question of what film can and cannot seek to capture—and takes it to a literal extreme. Seeking to imprint the daily, material matter of California surf culture directly onto the surface of the celluloid, West swam in the water with 400 feet of film, letting it brush past seaweed and crash into the sand. She then took it to the surfboard shaping workshop where she hand sanded it then squirted, dripped, splashed, sprayed and rubbed with donuts, zinc oxide, tequila, sunscreen, hydrogen peroxide, beer, sand, tar, and even scraped it with a shark’s tooth.","Based in Los Angeles, Jennifer West is known for her work with film, not only through creating moving images and photographs, but for her exploration of the materiality of the film itself. Rather than using the medium traditionally, West works with a particular method which she calls ‘direct film,’ where she applies a myriad of liquids, materials, and manipulations directly onto the surface of the film negatives. The results are hypnotic works that uniquely combine moving images with qualities reminiscent of painterly abstraction. West began making films with this method in 2004, and has since used 16mm, 35mm and 70mm film across her oeuvre. In terms of her process, a pivotal part is to imbue the celluloid with materials, smells and textures that are evocative of the scenes she films. Sprayed with perfume, whiskey, or pickle juice; dragged through the ocean; scraped by pedestrians and skateboarders—it is the physicality of life that gives her films their color and texture. Some of her most notable projects include a 2009 piece where West invited a group of teenagers to skateboard on top of film with footage of the sky, which was taped onto the floor of the Tate’s Turbine Hall. After being digitised, the final version of the film combines scenes of clouds and birds hovering with marks left by the skater’s movements. At its core, whether an image of the sky or the ocean, West’s work is concerned with the everyday: our trivial daily obsessions and motivations.",Dawn Surf Jellybowl,Americas,"['west.n.01', 'california.n.01', 'daily.s.01', 'movie.n.01', 'family.n.01', 'film.v.01', 'matter.n.01', 'coevals.n.01', 'multiple.a.01', 'footage.n.01', 'water.n.01', 'produce.v.01', 'community.n.01', 'hand.n.01', 'surface.n.01', 'sense.n.01', 'question.n.01', 'culture.n.01', 'time.n.01']","['material.n.01', 'surface.n.01', 'celluloid.n.01', 'texture.n.01', 'surfboard.v.01', 'nostalgia.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/jw_2011_dawn_surf_jellybowl_1_web.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/jw_2011_dawn_surf_jellybowl_1_web-300x169.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/dawn-surf-jellybowl/,"['Cultural/6.217948717948718', 'Society/3.91025641025641', 'Material_Physical/2.9230769230769234']","['Cultural', 'Society', 'Material_Physical']",13.051282051282051,"['Emotion/2.6263736263736264', 'Arts/2.371794871794872', 'Economy/2.371794871794872']","['Emotion', 'Arts', 'Economy']",7.36996336996337,"['Society/13.261227661227664', 'Cultural/13.036202686202687', 'Material_Physical/11.301709401709404']","['Society', 'Cultural', 'Material_Physical']",37.59913974913975,"['Land/7.994017094017094', 'Arts/5.028937728937729', 'Media/4.866239316239316']","['Land', 'Arts', 'Media']",17.88919413919414,1.0,0.3333333333333333
Tatsuki Masaru,"For the works KAKERA, Bullet Train and KAKERA, Loving God Tatsuki Masaru traveled throughout Japan to visit museums holding kakera (which translates to “fragments”) of Jomon Period potteries –Japan’s pre-history 2,300-15,000 years ago. Small and fragile, the kakera were donated by farmers who had found them in their fields, or by archeologists, and then wrapped in newspapers and stored away. Today they sit quietly on the shelves of museums, unknown to people. Tatsuki pulled the kakera out to photograph them with the wrapping newspaper backdrop, giving light to the neglected objects. Spanning from 1940s to 1980s, the wrapping newspapers record the time when the kakera were found and archived. In Bullet Train, the newspaper highlights the surprise of inspectors from 40 some countries to the encounter of the Tokaido Shinkansen, the oldest bullet train in Japan and today the most travelled high-speed rail route worldwide by far. Tatsuki’s photographs unfold a part of history of modern Japan while engaging broader discussion around the conservation and restitution of artifacts and cultural heritage.","Tatsuki Masaru  became an independent photographer in the late 1990s after studying under Kyoji  Takahashi, photographer mainly familiar to Japanese audiences for his commercial and fashion  photography but also an independent image-maker producing photos, films and installations. Exploring folkloric myths and the reality of people’s life in Japan, each of Tatsuki’s photography series is the result of a long-term research and engagement with his subject matter.

Pio Abad,"Comprising two sculptures, one photograph and one video, the installation Malakas & Maganda (1986 – 2016) questions the mythological iconography of the Filipino conjugal dictators Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos and thus addresses the construction of propaganda representation and the role of art facing current events. The work is organized around the leftovers of a copy of a monumental sculpture of Imelda Marcos, which the artist had commissioned and whose remains were stored in his studio.  Several included elements show how this body of work has evolved over time and in reaction to political events in the Philippines. The video footage, for example, was taken inside KADIST exhibition “Soil and Stones, Souls and Songs” with the Museum of Contemporary and Design in Manila in 2016, when the artist requested that his own piece (i.e. copied paintings representing the dictator) be repainted in black to protest against the revisionist funeral organized by current president Duterte. The installation was later presented for the first time as an ensemble at KADIST Paris for the exhibition “Conceal, cover with sand, replicate, translate, restore” in 2017.","In his practice, Pio Abad looks into the social and political significance of objects usually consigned to the sidelines of history. Abad uses different media such as textile, drawing, installation and photography, and employs strategies of appropriation to extract alternative readings and repressed historical events. Abad ties threads of complicity between events, ideologies and people. His artworks glide seamlessly between these histories, enacting quasi-fictional combinations with their leftovers and weaving together threads of complicity between events, ideologies and people. Pio Abad began his art studies at the University of the Philippines before receiving a BA from Glasgow School of Art and an MA from the Royal Academy Schools, London.",Malakas & Maganda (1986 – 2016),Asia,"['form.v.01', 'current.a.01', 'event.n.01', 'sculpture.n.01', 'song.n.01', 'footage.n.01', 'time.n.01', 'rock.n.01', 'paris.n.01', 'design.n.01', 'video.n.01', 'studio.n.01', 'construction.n.01', 'museum.n.01', 'function.n.03', 'elements.n.01', 'representation.n.01', 'black.a.01', 'question.n.01', 'political.a.01', 'piece.n.01', 'body.n.01', 'photograph.n.01']","['dictatorship.n.01', 'propaganda.n.01', 'protest.n.01', 'painting.n.01', 'political.a.01', 'dissidence.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG__Pio-Abad-Malakas-Maganda-1986-–-2016_WEB.png,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG__Pio-Abad-Malakas-Maganda-1986-–-2016_WEB-201x300.png,https://kadist.org/work/malakas-maganda-1986-2016/,"['Politics/7.24423076923077', 'Cultural/5.254084967320261', 'Material_Physical/2.672514619883041']","['Politics', 'Cultural', 'Material_Physical']",15.170830356434072,"['Arts/4.476307189542483', 'Activism/3.875', 'Politics/1.7692307692307692']","['Arts', 'Activism', 'Politics']",10.120537958773252,"['Cultural/28.15214034331682', 'Material_Physical/21.531623931623933', 'Individual_Personal/13.077777777777783']","['Cultural', 'Material_Physical', 'Individual_Personal']",62.76154205271854,"['Arts/14.520588235294118', 'Space/12.692307692307692', 'Culture/5.047008547008548']","['Arts', 'Space', 'Culture']",32.25990447461036,0.6666666666666666,0.3333333333333333
A.K. Burns,"In a 2002 Pentagon press conference, former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld addressed a question about Iraq’s alleged weapons of mass destruction with an unforgettable evasion: there are known knowns, known unknowns, and unknown unknowns, the latter being the most precarious. In a trilogy of nearly identical sculptures by A.K. Burns, the artist conjures the same string of word compounds on a metal gate nearly 15 years after Rumsfeld’s infamous statement.

I-Hsuen Chen,"Part of the series Still Life Analysis II: The Island, the two photographs The Objects under the Civic Boulevard and A Yellow Blanket on a Wooden Pallet feature household objects of vagrants living beneath the Taipei’s Civic Boulevard expressway. Such objects include trash, unidentified discarded objects, and plants. For the artist, the underside of Civic Boulevard resembles a subtropical island with its artificial stones and potted plants decor. On this island, “citizens” carry with them “objects” that temporarily occupy spaces that could be called home before being removed by the authorities.  In contrast, real estate advertisements are crowded together nearby and praise an idyllic, beautiful housing environment and depict the collective desire of Taipei inhabitants for home and lifestyle. The artist collected the written information and advertising slogans, yet eliminated the sales details, such as project names and locations, leaving apparent the blanks and punctuations. What is left of these commercial messages takes the form of poetry, gathered in Real Estate Poem #9 and #10, shown alongside the photographs. A shift in the viewing perspective with the photographs’ subject occurs when pages of the poems are reversed (sometimes presented upside down), echoing the experience of the island “citizens” under the expressway. Between satire and mourning, the work attempts to situate oneself on the thin line separating the private and the public, to address tensions between homelessness and senses of home and to question the nature of property in constant, fluctuating relationships of occupation, re-occupation, and elimination.","I-Hsuen Chen started focusing on visual arts in the late 2000s after working as a professional opera and choir singer in Taiwan. He moved to New York to attend school and returned to Taiwan in 2012 where he developed series of works informed by his personal experience of straddling between two worlds. If photography plays an important role in his practice, Chen also works with video, installation, and performance to explore how imagery as a medium of communication generates fallacy and obscurity, while portraying the daily history of a place, a person, or subject.",Still Life Analysis II: The Island series,Asia,"['island.n.01', 'ad.n.01', 'plant.n.01', 'object.n.01', 'real.a.01', 'populace.n.01', 'message.n.01', 'occupation.n.01', 'capable.s.02', 'private.a.01', 'shift.n.01', 'picture.v.02', 'leave.v.01', 'changeless.s.02', 'feature.n.01', 'photograph.n.01', 'rock.n.01', 'details.n.01', 'location.n.01', 'desire.n.01', 'contrast.n.01', 'write.v.01', 'tension.n.01', 'corporate.s.03', 'government.n.01']","['exploitation.n.01', 'homeless.n.01', 'housing.n.01', 'sarcasm.n.01', 'city.n.01', 'poverty.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_Real-Estate-Poem-9_WEB.png,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_Real-Estate-Poem-9_WEB-239x300.png,https://kadist.org/work/still-life-analysis/,"['Society/9.619133807369101', 'Politics/6.731221719457013', 'Cultural/4.792760180995475']","['Society', 'Politics', 'Cultural']",21.14311570782159,"['Urbanization/6.392760180995475', 'Land/3.2248366013071896', 'Power/3.1076923076923078']","['Urbanization', 'Land', 'Power']",12.725289089994972,"['Individual_Personal/20.53054461877992', 'Material_Physical/18.74306543130073', 'Cultural/15.044250520721112']","['Individual_Personal', 'Material_Physical', 'Cultural']",54.31786057080176,"['Emotion/12.381618381618384', 'Space/8.923931623931624', 'Arts/4.283333333333333']","['Emotion', 'Space', 'Arts']",25.588883338883342,0.3333333333333333,0.0
Jeamin Cha,"Fog and Smoke is the first video Jeamin Cha made after returning to Seoul from London where she studied and started as an investigation into the meaning of “otherness” in documentary filmmaking. The opening scene depicts an abandoned construction site that had once been part of the Songdo International Business District in Incheon, near Seoul. In the dark of the night, the sounds of a countdown and piano notes fill an empty apartment building and echoes far into the unknown corners and hollows of a newly built city. Delicate movements of the camera follow the last remaining fisherman in the old town as he drives toward the new town: once his waterfront workplace, the land is now filled in with soil and the debris of city development. Sequences of the fisherman’s journey into the cityscape are woven together with movements of the ghostly tap dancer continuing his frantic tapping in the empty streets at night. Nothing seems to ever happen as the camera follows patiently each individual as they retrace their daily routes and tell personal stories, representative of the artist’s methodology to let herself guided by encounters and unplanned conversations. The rapid socio-economic and political changes in the city appear slowed down, to the exception of the scene with the tap-dancer whose frantic tappings in the dark (as if possessed) become a metaphor for capitalism and echo the speed of gentrification driving these developments. If the video refers to the craze of urban construction in Korea and its halt due to the global financial crisis and economic recession after 2008, the depicted cityscape could belong to any location of hyper-capitalism in the world.","News articles or anecdotes from daily life often trigger Jeamin Cha’s videos. Her unplanned encounters, discoveries, and daily exchanges with people she meets in the streets guide the production of her videos, often through processes of interviews and field studies. Yet, rather than using didactic forms of documentation, she reconstructs images and narratives while looking for ways to connect her position as an individual with the layers of social fabric. The artist’s works question the premises of political action and addressing anxieties or ambiguities hidden within the seemingly ordinary everyday life. As such, intervention has become for her a sensitive form of expression that incites processes of questioning and investigation into the ever-present contradictions of the contemporary society.",Fog and Smoke,Asia,"['dark.n.01', 'town.n.01', 'night.n.01', 'development.n.01', 'city.n.01', 'construction.n.01', 'motion.n.03', 'camera.n.01', 'scene.n.01', 'apartment.n.01', 'note.n.01', 'probe.n.01', 'unknown.a.01', 'district.n.01', 'brush.n.06', 'conversation.n.01', 'documentary.a.01', 'journey.n.01', 'sequence.n.01', 'global.s.01', 'land.n.01', 'location.n.01', 'daily.s.01', 'video.n.01', 'metaphor.n.01']","['moviemaking.n.01', 'capitalism.n.01', 'gentrification.n.01', 'cityscape.n.01', 'narrative.n.01', 'society.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_FS1_WEB.png,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_FS1_WEB-300x168.png,https://kadist.org/work/fog-and-smoke/,"['Society/3.8333333333333335', 'Cultural/2.909090909090909', 'Politics/1.675']","['Society', 'Cultural', 'Politics']",8.417424242424243,"['Fantasy/1.9090909090909092', 'Economy/1.8333333333333335', 'Community/1.0']","['Fantasy', 'Economy', 'Community']",4.742424242424242,"['Material_Physical/37.44019428284135', 'Society/29.646576239378103', 'Politics/12.37574205120645']","['Material_Physical', 'Society', 'Politics']",79.4625125734259,"['Land/22.160295913237093', 'Urbanization/18.040088016558606', 'Geopolitics/7.491778465772274']","['Land', 'Urbanization', 'Geopolitics']",47.692162395567976,0.6666666666666666,0.0
Li Ran,"The four-channel video installation Same Old Crowd departs from the documentation of an unknown city and takes place in an ambiguous temporal and spatial frame. Twelve characters (amateur actors hired by the artist) appear in black-and-white in highly stylized surroundings wearing patterned cloths. The identities or time period of the characters, all deprived of languages, are impossible to determine. Punctuated by staccato sounds and fast camerawork, the protagonists’ exaggerated expressions and emphatic gestures create a high level of tension.  For the artist, repetitions in the video do not attempt to level notion of “difference.” Rather repetition is antithetical to the notion of novelty within the discourse of reality, modernity, and media. As such, Same Old Crowd recalls the artists’ earlier video Beyond Geography and can also be seen as a type of anthropological theater intersecting with performance studies.","Li Ran produces video, installation, and performance-based works that examine various states of parody and simulacra in the digital world. Through performative narrative, reproduction, mimicry, and satire, Li Ran’s work straddles the line between fact and fiction in playful explorations of the meaning and making of truth. Li’s describes his own artwork with the language of architecture: that if an artwork is a like room, its meaning should be open and porous, not forced against a unilateral interpretation. This virtual-minded analogy is fitting inasmuch as Li’s practice increasingly hinges on the exploration of the non-reality within reality.

Miguel Angel Ríos,"For Piedras Blancas, arguably his most ambitious and visually arresting video to date, Miguel Angel Ríos made 3,000 “piedras” out of a concrete/stone composite.  The video is shot in arid, mountainous locations in Mexico (his adopted country) and Argentina (his home country). Over several months, Ríos scouted locations for natural-worn tributaries where he eventually allowed these balls to then thunder down the mountain. The work is violent and humorous at once, absurd and impossible (a signature style of the artist). These “piedras” take on an anthropomorphic quality, as if they were people migrating in mass, akin to a wildebeest crossing in the Masai mara. They also provide a metaphor for drugs running through one’s veins. The work has been on view at Arizona State University Museum, Gallery Wendi Norris, EXPO Chicago’s Black Box Program curated by the Centre Pompidou’s Florence Derieux, at the Palais de Tokyo and in the Daros Latin America Collection.","Miguel Angel Ríos studied at the Academy of Fine Arts in Buenos Aires before moving to New York in the 1970’s to escape the military dictatorship in Argentina. He subsequently relocated to Mexico and now divides his time between New York and Mexico City. In his work, Ríos pairs a rigorous conceptual approach with a meticulously constructed, handmade aesthetic. Since the 1970’s, he has made work about the concept of the Latin American, using this idea as both an artistic strategy and a political problem. Over the past two decades, Ríos has delved into the medium of video to create symbolic narratives about human experience, violence, and mortality. His videos of spinning tops–trompos–use the childhood game as a backdrop for a meditation on the transience of life, and the mechanics of power.",Piedras Blancas,Americas,"['location.n.01', 'state.n.04', 'mountain.n.01', 'shoot.v.01', 'plan.n.01', 'mass.n.01', 'mexico.n.01', 'box.n.01', 'black.n.01', 'united_states.n.01', 'video.n.01', 'quality.n.01', 'metaphor.n.01', 'museum.n.01', 'position.n.03', 'manner.n.01', 'people.n.01']","['symbolism.n.01', 'transience.n.01', 'migration.n.01', 'motion.n.03', 'batch.n.02', 'border.v.05']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_still-from-the-film-process-PIEDRAS-BLANCAS-8073_WEB.png,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_still-from-the-film-process-PIEDRAS-BLANCAS-8073_WEB-300x168.png,https://kadist.org/work/piedras-blancas/,"['Politics/8.327760577915376', 'Material_Physical/3.443253968253968', 'Society/3.379084967320261']","['Politics', 'Material_Physical', 'Society']",15.150099513489604,"['Geopolitics/5.927760577915376', 'Time/2.6654761904761903', 'Body/1.8235294117647058']","['Geopolitics', 'Time', 'Body']",10.416766180156273,"['Material_Physical/21.641353383458647', 'Individual_Personal/10.13821733821734', 'Politics/10.024836601307191']","['Material_Physical', 'Individual_Personal', 'Politics']",41.80440732298318,"['Land/11.328654970760235', 'Politics/5.088888888888889', 'Values/4.914285714285714']","['Land', 'Politics', 'Values']",21.331829573934836,0.6666666666666666,0.0
Tun Win Aung and Wah Nu,"Tun Win Aung and Wah Nu initiated the series 1000 Pieces (of White) in 2009, as a way to produce objects and images as a portrait of their shared life as partners and collaborators. Interweaving public and private, personal anecdote and pop cultural appropriation, their work attests to the poetry of the everyday. In addition to found and original materials, the artists have occasionally incorporated drawings and sketches by artist friends, and even by their own daughter into the ongoing work. They selectively whitewash the surfaces to visually link the series’ disparate elements. The gesture isolates or obscures certain details, evoking the passage of time and the fading of memory. Some components address history and politics; others appear more whimsical and intimate. The collage drawings capture the intersection of shared and individual histories, the transformation of public information into private knowledge.  The images of White Piece #0126 are from the newspaper propaganda that supported the Burma Socialist Program Party (BSPP)’s very first congress in 1971. The three hands at the bottom represent the three classes, always addressed as ‘The People’ by the Socialist Government. The objects held in the gripping hands include a sickle, pickaxe, and brush and pen and represent farmer, laborer, and white-collar worker. The figures of people at the background appear to support the Socialist Program Party, the Socialist Government, and the Army. When the artists made this work, they included the sun-like-logo with rays, which was the logo of the party and which referenced its good time. Light blue was the color of the Myanmar socialist era, and was the color that represented the party, as well. The artists were familiar with the color throughout their childhood. They wrote that whenever we see this color they miss their childhood, but with a fright.","Wah Nu and Tun Win Aung, respectively born in 1977 and 1975, Yangon, Myanmar. Live and work Yangon. Wah Nu and Tun Win graduated from the University of Culture, Yangon, in 1998, Wah Nu with a BA in traditional Burmese music, Tun Win Aung with a BA in sculpture. After completing her studies, Wah Nu turned to painting and video, while Tun Win Aung extended his practice to performance, multimedia work, and painting.

Yang Song,"Yang Song’s Die features a clay mask of the artist himself slowly dissolving into water. Clay returns to clay. Clay originates from and returns to earth, becoming a metaphor for life. Here influenced by the traditions of temples and Chinese burial customs, the simple gesture of creation-destruction explores questions of transformation to provide a vision of life cycle as nonlinear but continuous. The choice of materials echoes a fundamental divergence between Western and Eastern classical traditions of sculpture: if classical Western sculpture preferred materials like stone and bronze for their relative inflexibility while discarding clay for its malleability and fragility, classical Eastern sculpture commonly used clay as a primary material.","Yang Song was trained as a sculptor in both Western and Eastern traditions, which continue to influence his practice today. Yang’s sculptures often follow traditional methods, evoking ancient Buddhist status and the terracotta warriors of Xi’an yet leaving them unfired so they would crack and eventually crumble to dust. Similarly, Yang Song conceptually treats his videos and drawings as sculptures, specifically in their presentations. For him, a sense of permanence is intrinsic to sculpture beyond the sole materials that may span centuries. Yet, for the artist, inflexibility is not what gives sculptures a sense of eternity, but rather its fragility and transience inherent to our eternity and human condition.",Die,Asia,"['western.a.01', 'material.n.01', 'tradition.n.01', 'sculpture.n.01', 'mask.n.01', 'song.n.01', 'chinese.a.01', 'transformation.n.01', 'life.n.01', 'water.n.01', 'rock.n.01', 'vision.n.01', 'metaphor.n.01', 'simple.a.01', 'gesture.n.01', 'cardinal.s.01', 'question.n.01']","['death.n.01', 'life.n.01', 'custom.n.02', 'sculpture.n.02', 'materiality.n.02', 'body.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_Die-Video-41522-2014.-Coutesy-Gallery-Yang-and-the-artist_WEB.png,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_Die-Video-41522-2014.-Coutesy-Gallery-Yang-and-the-artist_WEB-300x168.png,https://kadist.org/work/die/,"['Material_Physical/14.721911421911427', 'Cultural/11.183281733746133', 'Individual_Personal/7.708771929824561']","['Material_Physical', 'Cultural', 'Individual_Personal']",33.61396508548212,"['Arts/8.049948400412797', 'Space/6.346153846153846', 'Materiality/4.344988344988345']","['Arts', 'Space', 'Materiality']",18.741090591554986,"['Material_Physical/16.896367521367527', 'Individual_Personal/15.346182575594346', 'Cultural/13.172888386123683']","['Material_Physical', 'Individual_Personal', 'Cultural']",45.41543848308555,"['Space/6.346153846153846', 'Arts/5.7455379587732525', 'Mind/5.663247863247864']","['Space', 'Arts', 'Mind']",17.754939668174963,1.0,0.6666666666666666
Yoshinori Niwa,"Yoshinori Niwa’s investigation into the monetary system and material goods is witnessed across a range of his works. As the title of this work indicates, Niwa visits several currency exchanges in the market in Istanbul and proceeds to continually exchange from one currency into another until he has no money left, going against the grain of the economy. The laborious act of exchanging the currency back and forth does not create any profit. Instead, only time itself disappears – time is arguable to actual common factor between all our existences, and it is monetised accordingly within our society. As a result the staff at the currency exchange offices get increasingly confused and angry, frustrated, perhaps, that the laborious act no longer makes any sense in their business context.","Yoshinori Niwa’s practice takes the form of social interventions, executed through performance, video and installation. Through the construction of absurd scenarios, Niwa deploys a nonsensical vernacular to examine systems of exchange that drive contemporary society, as well as disjunctures in collective conceptions of history, ideology and value —an artistic strategy whose roots can be traced to the post-war Japanese avant-garde. Niwa graduated Tama Art University’s Department of Moving Images and Performing Arts in 2005. Niwa’s work has been exhibited internationally. His latest exhibitions in 2016 include: solo exhibitions at Minatomachi Art Table (Nagoya, Japan) and 1335MABINI (Manila, Philippines); and group shows at Marugame Genichiro-Inokuma Museum of Contemporary Art (Marugame, Japan) and Setouchi Triennale 2016 (Naoshima Island, Japan).Niwa was selected as one of ArtReview’s Future Greats in 2014.",Exchanging between Turkish Lira and Euros in Istanbul until there is nothing left,Asia,"['exchange.n.01', 'money.n.01', 'probe.n.01', 'market.n.01', 'being.n.01', 'economy.n.01', 'common.a.01', 'time.n.01', 'society.n.01', 'consequence.n.01', 'sense.n.01', 'context.n.01', 'title.n.01', 'make.v.03']","['money.n.01', 'economy.n.03', 'exchange.n.03', 'value.n.01', 'labor.n.02', 'commodity.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_Yoshinori-Niwa_Exchanging-Turkish-Lira...2011_still-1_WEB.png,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_Yoshinori-Niwa_Exchanging-Turkish-Lira...2011_still-1_WEB-300x225.png,https://kadist.org/work/exchanging-between-turkish/,"['Cultural/10.213553113553115', 'Society/7.8307692307692305', 'Individual_Personal/3.97856829161177']","['Cultural', 'Society', 'Individual_Personal']",22.022890635934115,"['Economy/5.492307692307692', 'Arts/3.228937728937729', 'Values/2.37856829161177']","['Economy', 'Arts', 'Values']",11.099813712857191,"['Society/12.093040293040296', 'Cultural/9.699806076276666', 'Individual_Personal/9.125227713463008']","['Society', 'Cultural', 'Individual_Personal']",30.91807408277997,"['Economy/5.402564102564103', 'Spirituality/4.166233766233766', 'Materiality/3.420745920745921']","['Economy', 'Spirituality', 'Materiality']",12.98954378954379,1.0,0.3333333333333333
John Morris,"Untitled was part of the 2002 exhibition “Drawings for the Austrian School”  held at the D’Amelio Terras gallery in New York. For this occasion, Morris created a language of his own by using acrylic, ink, graphite and ballpoint pen on paper.  The exhibition title comes from Morris’ interest in the early 20th century Austrian economist Joseph Schumpeter, a one time Austrian Minister of Finance, bank director, and economics professor who taught in Europe and at Harvard University. He is considered the founder of “evolutionary economics.” One of his most well-known economic terms is “creative destruction,” which states that entrepreneurs with new ideas must destroy business models and practices that came before them in order to stimulate economic change. Many of Morris’ earlier drawings are dedicated to technology companies that no longer exist, having been incorporated into larger organizations or made obsolete by changes in the market, exemplifying Schumpeter’s process. Untitled refers to these theories, layering together repetitive motifs that subtly mutate from one page to the other.","John Morris practices what critic Allan Weiss calls “ poetics of the ad infinitum” an ecstatic but precise doodling in which handmade marks stand for unrepresentable holism. His drawings are roughly the size of lined binder paper and are often made on just this unassuming support. For Morris art is a direct, indexical and therefore euphoric transcription of thought, in which every sign is motivated by some mystical urgency known only to the author.John Morris was born in 1965.

Carolina Saquel Martinez,"The artist films a horse dressage session at night, in a dimly lit manège. In this video the artist recalls the importance of traditional equestrian portraits in Spanish painting and relates to the repetitive passage between the rider and the mount. This effect of repetition is accentuated by the video played in a loop and the fixed framing of the image shot from the ground, with body posture and dressage themes as a method for training and obedience.  The voice over text becomes a metaphor of our behaviors, of our actions and of “any work construction”. The rhythm and the tone of the voice participate in the work’s seduction and stick to the images like a chorus: “¿ Donde estas ? ¿ Avanzas o retrocedes ?” (“Where are you? Are you going forward or backwards?”)","Caroline Saquel was born in Chile and now lives and works in Paris. After graduating in art from Santiago de Chili Pontifical Catholic University, she enrolled at the National Studio of Contemporary Art of Le Fresnoy, from 2003 to 2005 and then carried on her research at the University of Paris 8, Vincennes-Saint-Denis where she completed a Master’s degree in 2008, in contemporary art and new media.  In the other videos she has produced, she uses moving image as a power enabling the alteration of time. Throughout her work she has questioned the relationship between her videos and painting, as well as the sculptural use that could be made of them. She uses nature as raw material, playing on textures, tones, the relationships between shade and light. She gives much importance to the rhythms of the images through perspective and leveling effects, complex movements of the camera or on the contrary insists on immobility and the strict definition of the framed image.",Pentimenti,Americas,"['voice.n.01', 'method.n.01', 'rhythm.n.01', 'tone.n.01', 'repeat.n.01', 'passage.n.01', 'land.n.04', 'night.n.01', 'video.n.01', 'metaphor.n.01', 'traditional.a.01', 'shooting.n.01', 'construction.n.01', 'action.n.01', 'image.n.01', 'portrayal.n.01', 'subject.n.01', 'body.n.01']","['animal.n.01', 'motion.n.03', 'custom.n.02', 'body.n.01', 'obedience.n.01', 'action.n.02']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/ASSISsite.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/ASSISsite-300x240.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/pentimenti/,"['Material_Physical/12.173504273504276', 'Politics/7.971845148315736', 'Individual_Personal/5.9692307692307685']","['Material_Physical', 'Politics', 'Individual_Personal']",26.11458019105078,"['Space/6.346153846153846', 'Geopolitics/3.9718451483157367', 'Power/3.2']","['Space', 'Geopolitics', 'Power']",13.517998994469583,"['Cultural/19.226546003016594', 'Material_Physical/18.901354347406986', 'Individual_Personal/13.98021439344969']","['Cultural', 'Material_Physical', 'Individual_Personal']",52.10811474387327,"['Time/6.891117216117217', 'Space/6.346153846153846', 'Body/5.140379228614522']","['Time', 'Space', 'Body']",18.377650290885583,0.6666666666666666,0.3333333333333333
Martin Creed,,"Martin Creed is a sculptor, filmmaker, performer and installation artist. Working within a minimal or conceptual mode, most of his artworks, objects, statements, suggestions or performances are titled “Work” and numbered. He wittily subverts the definitions of art and often uses mundane modest materials such as Blu-Tack, balloons, tape, piles of paper. In 1993, Work No. 81 consisted of a one-inch cube of masking tape in the middle of every wall in a London firm and since 1998 Work No. 200 proposes “the air in a given space” through filling it with balloons. Yet any anti-materialism is occasionally counteracted like in the marble staircase realized for the city of Edinburgh or the bronze sculptures.

Valentina Liernur,"Titled in numeric sequence, Corruzione #2, #3, and #5 (italian for corruption) is a group of paintings by Valentina Liernur that suggest fetish and the act of dominance. The first of the three features a nude female figure seen from behind, her body language — curved spine, and head tilted downwards — indicating resistance from a pair of hands grasping her by the arms. To the right of the composition a second hand, an accomplice, holds a whip or a cane with which to inflict pain. Several other hands are featured again in Corruzione #2 and#5, suggesting a connection between the three scenes, perhaps a sinister narrative that binds them together. On the second panel, the disembodied hands appear now surrounding an inert and passive female body seen from the waist down, and in the third, they are pictured alone in an assertive position, as if they were saluting or enforcing an order. Carried through all three works is a curiosity in the semiotics of dominance and power, both seen through and inflicted by the body.","Known primarily for her paintings, but also working within performance and installation, Valentina Limur explores themes of identity, the female body, sex, fetishization, pleasure and pain. Her previous studies in architecture, music and theatre inform her unique conception of painting, which is infused with elements of theatricality and performance. In Liernur’s approach, style can be applied as a performative principle, and the body is always part of the process: whether as subject matter or as the movement suggested by gestural brushstrokes and the aggressive tearing, scratching and bleaching that she inflicts on her canvases. Liernur’s style is malleable and undecided, pivoting between abstraction and figuration and nodding to a wide range of art historical legacies and figures — from Picasso to Francis Bacon to the slashed canvases of Lucio Fontana. Her process is inspired by the mundane and driven by a sense of play and discovery with the materials she stumbles upon.

Paloma Bosquê,"Ritmo para 2 (Rhythm for 2) is a set of 5 individual pieces, all sharing the same title. Each piece consists of two overlapping wooden squares that are held together by a Lurex thread, a type of yarn with golden metallic appearance that wraps in and out of the frames at various points.   The use of geometry and clean lines that characterize these assemblages bring to mind the rich modernist legacy of her native Brazil, and establishes a dialogue with the work of other artists that brought modernism into question such as Hélio Oiticica. For example, the contrasting qualities between the materials that Bosquê uses in this series, is reminiscent of Oiticica’s Bólides (Fireballs), in which straight lines of geometric structures sit in stark contrast to materials such as raw pigment, glass, stones, and textiles. In the case of Ritmo para 2, the Lurex line and the nature of thread itself, soft and flexible, contrasts against the rigidity of the wooden frames. As per most of her oeuvre, the materials in Ritmo para 2 exist in a perfect confluence: integrated and reliant on each other, yet clearly distinct.","Play and intuition are an important part of Paloma Bosquê’s process and approach to sculpture. As she stumbles upon materials, she brings them to her studio to reimagine their potential new lives. Rather than being concerned with the symbolic weight and connotations that materials may carry from their previous lives, what interests Bosquê is their form, their physical presence, and the possible relationships that may unfold between them.     While some of the materials she uses, such as brass, bronze, and wood, are part of the traditional vernacular of sculpture, she also incorporates a range of unconventional, organic materials borrowed from the everyday: charcoal, beeswax, animal guts, handmade papers, coffee sieves, and beeswax included. Playing with the contrasting qualities between materials—the cold and rigid nature of metals against the warmth and irregularity of hand-woven wool or beeswax—Bosquê achieves a delicate balance of texture and weight, never forcing the materials or transforming them beyond recognition. This intuitive way of responding to the materials’ specificity is evocative of the notion of animism, the belief that inanimate objects, plants, rocks, soil, weather systems…etc., have a spiritual essence, and as such, are all interconnected.     Her restrained economy of materials and inclination for formal simplicity, echo the sensibility of artists like Eva Hesse and Louise Bourgeois, where both geometry and formlessness can co-exist. Embracing both the fluid contours of nature and the ideal angles of platonic form, akin to Hesse and Bourgeois, Bosquê’s sculptural vocabulary reminds us of the delicate balance that holds us together.",Ritmo para 2,Americas,"['wooden.s.01', 'contrast.n.01', 'line.n.01', 'material.n.01', 'frame.n.01', 'piece.n.01', 'square.n.01', 'geometric.s.01', 'rhythm.n.01', 'keep.v.01', 'gathering.n.01', 'dialogue.n.01', 'type.n.01', 'native.a.01', 'glass.n.01', 'appearance.n.01', 'rock.n.01', 'fabric.n.01', 'quality.n.01', 'set.n.01', 'individual.a.01', 'structure.n.01', 'artist.n.01', 'nature.n.01', 'question.n.01']","['abstraction.n.01', 'materiality.n.01', 'intuition.n.01', 'modernism.n.01', 'geometry.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/IMG_Ritmo-para-2-MW.PBS_.B.005.00.00_WEB.png,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/IMG_Ritmo-para-2-MW.PBS_.B.005.00.00_WEB-271x300.png,https://kadist.org/work/ritmo-para-2/,"['Cultural/10.775555309843234', 'Individual_Personal/5.8464285714285715', 'Material_Physical/3.2698412698412698']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Material_Physical']",19.891825151113075,"['Arts/4.0318627450980395', 'Mind/3.3714285714285714', 'Culture/2.5619047619047617']","['Arts', 'Mind', 'Culture']",9.965196078431372,"['Cultural/18.43503163503164', 'Material_Physical/17.85213675213676', 'Society/12.273193473193475']","['Cultural', 'Material_Physical', 'Society']",48.56036186036187,"['Arts/7.424542124542125', 'Space/7.146153846153846', 'Design/6.333566433566434']","['Arts', 'Space', 'Design']",20.904262404262404,0.6666666666666666,0.3333333333333333
Aurélien Froment,"dbqp is a photographic series in which the artist handles an enlargement of the plate with three cutout windows which was used for L’Archipel (The Archipelago) in collaboration with Pierre Leguillon. The previous work took the form of four photographs presenting a page illustrated with three images. By studying these with more attention, it is possible to figure out that these objects were placed behind the pierced card with three openings. Recourse to the photograph had given the impression of flatness. In this photo, he reveals his tricks in a burlesque manner by using a copy of this visual tool enlarged to the extent that the handling becomes difficult. He is interested in reenacting or requesting the reenactment of works he has already made in order to create narrative in perpetual evolution. Here the absence of images refers to the autonomy of images that can leave their frame and presentation mode, physically and symbolically. As in Théâtre de Poche, this work is the result of a performance. It could be considered a self-portrait of the artist confronted with the tools of his trade. Here one finds many of Froment’s obsessions: the relation between the plane and perspective, questions of viewpoints and positioning with a distinct bodily presence, the modes of circulation of images. The title refers to the rotation of letters. This series was realized during a trip to San Francisco.","Aurélien Froment was born in Angers, France in 1976.

Yael Bartana,"Yael Bartana’s video work A Declaration was shot in southern Tel Aviv, on the visible border between that city and Jaffa. It begins with the sound of waves and the image of the Israeli flag that fills the entire screen. This is followed by the whirring sounds of a helicopter. A young man in a white undershirt rows a boat carrying an olive tree in its place. With her camera work Bartana seems to flirt with 1930s Jewish National Fund (JNF) propaganda photography on the one hand, and with Leni Riefenstahl’s photographic technique, like the use of soft focus that distorts the perspective and vanishing point, on the other, A Declaration already attests to the action itself: on Andromeda’s Rock, Bartana replaces the Israeli flag with an olive tree. While this is indeed an act performed in a media context, it nevertheless takes place in the sphere of Israeli reality.  (exh.cat. Kunstverein in Hamburg, Hatje Cantz, 2007, p. 93)","The work of Yael Bartana investigates the imagination and imagery of identity and the politics of national memory and identity. Her interest in understanding and examining national statehood stems from being born in Israel, and being surrounded by the perpetual production of collective national identity. After completing her studies, Bartana undertook what she called ‘amateur anthropological’ research into ritual and myth making to take a critical perspective towards her own history and nationality. As a result of her politically charged practice that often deals with Jewish identity in Israel and abroad, she has garnered significant criticism, notably being labeled as anti-Zionist and a self-hating Jew. Despite this criticism, Bartana believes that, through her work as an artist, exploring both political statehood and religious and political diaspora, she is responsible for addressing these issues. Bartana believes that growing up in such a politically charged state requires artists to become either political artists, or escapists.",A Declaration,Middle East & Africa,"['flag.n.01', 'tree.n.01', 'sound.n.01', 'wave.n.01', 'shoot.v.01', 'perform.v.01', 'boundary_line.n.01', 'rock.n.01', 'technique.n.01', 'visible.a.01', 'screen.n.01', 'hand.n.01', 'photography.n.01', 'photographic.a.01', 'action.n.01', 'position.n.03', 'context.n.01', 'white.a.01', 'medium.n.01', 'world.n.03', 'camera.n.01', 'city.n.01', 'video.n.01']","['coexistence.n.01', 'olive_tree.n.01', 'zionism.n.01', 'armistice.n.01', 'heterogeneity.n.01', 'peace.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Yael-Bartana_A-Declaration_tree_site.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Yael-Bartana_A-Declaration_tree_site-300x225.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/a-declaration/,"['Individual_Personal/3.213675213675214', 'Material_Physical/2.435897435897436', 'Society/1.6387959866220736']","['Individual_Personal', 'Material_Physical', 'Society']",7.288368636194724,"['Materiality/2.435897435897436', 'Colonization/0.8695652173913043', 'Body/0.8333333333333334']","['Materiality', 'Colonization', 'Body']",4.138795986622074,"['Cultural/25.6448079096686', 'Material_Physical/17.840673705379594', 'Politics/16.352828054298648']","['Cultural', 'Material_Physical', 'Politics']",59.83830966934684,"['Space/7.969683257918551', 'Media/7.531108597285066', 'Arts/6.04553691922113']","['Space', 'Media', 'Arts']",21.546328774424747,0.3333333333333333,0.0
Mark Leckey,"In Made In Heaven, we are face to face with a sculptural apparition, a divine visitation in the artist’s studio. It isn’t just any object, but an iconic sculpture of the end of the 20th century: Jeff Koons’ Bunny.  One key question in this work is of course the construction of images, but there is also the question of sculpture, of the passage from two-dimensionality to three-dimensionality. The reason for using the moving image, above all theoretical, is also part of interrogation regarding the material construction of images. For this film, he remakes Koons’s sculpture in order to be able to experiment himself in his studio. One can discern the contours of his studio and sometimes his presence in a lot of his videos. With reference to Marcel Duchamp, he wants to create the ultimate Machine Célibataire (Bachelor Machine), by producing nothing other than itself in reference to the self- reflexivity of Pop.  The Bunny is a sculptural form in space which also produces images. It is obvious that we are in an image which is entirely constructed since it is impossible to film the object without having, at a certain point, the reflection of the camera on the steel surface. Mark Leckey is interested in the possibilities of new technologies and places at the heart of his practice the revelation of a sensitive and quasi-magical world. The film loop (which only lasts 2mn) places the spectator in a completely hypnotic state.","Mark Leckey became know in the 1990s with a cult film Fiorucci Made Me Hardcore about English clubs since the early 1970s. Rather like Jeremy Deller, his work at the time was a mixture of Pop culture and counter-culture. In fact a constant in his work is an interest in the icons of our visual culture. In Felix Gets Broadcasted, he became interested in Felix The Cat who was first of all present at the beginning of the 20th century in over 250 newspapers and was the first character to benefit from TV transmission in 1928 in New York. This is the story of a cartoon hero and his successful conversion from cinema to the written press and then to TV, before being integrated into the art system. Mark Leckey is of the same generation as Damien Hirst but has had a very different career path. He was part of an alternative music band and is currently professor of the history of cinema in Frankfurt. He won the Turner Prize in 2008.  Mark Leckey was born in Birkenhead, UK .

Tobias Rehberger,"9’oclock (my time is not your time) pertains to a series consisting of three numbers: 5, 10 and 11 works were made for the exhibition “Signs and messages from modern life” at the Kate McGarry Gallery in 2007. The notion of time is a recurring theme in Tobias Rehberger’s work. We can recall the exhibition ‘Night Shift’ at the Palais de Tokyo ( Paris) in 2002 where the works could be seen only from the angle of the sun, exploring the relationship between day, night, and other natural cycles like the sun and moon, life and death. But in 9’oclock (my time is not your time), time becomes a pattern. The artist manipulates the number nine by printing it on three stacked glass plates. Depending on the position and the viewer’s eye, the shape evolves to deconstruct the meaning completely. This work is characteristic of artist’s practice in the way in which he borrows 70s design (in the refinement of its production, its appearance, and color), and the issue of perception, of deconstruction, and transformation.","A student of Martin Kippenberger, Tobias Rehberger emerged in the 1990s as one of the major artists of the younger generation in Germany and one of the most active on the international stage. For example, he worked with the artist Olafur Eliasson and presented his work in solo exhibitions in institutions: the Museum Ludwig in Cologne, the Palacio de Cristal in Madrid, the Whitechapel in London, the Serralves Foundation in Porto or the Palais de Tokyo in Paris. Tobias Rehberger can be considered as a sculptor, in the “classic” sense, while questioning the medium and its meaning today. Close to the aesthetics of design, he realizes functional forms not like his sculptures entitled “Handicapped” or “Infections”.  Tobias Rhberger was born in 1966 in Essligen am Neckar, Germany.

Nathalie Djurberg,"Like many of Djurberg’s films this work engages with the nightmarish grotesque, a theme of common currency in contemporary art. In this particular film, Djurberg deals with a theme that is becoming all too common in our lives, caring for an elderly, infirm parent. The film suggests not only the degradation of the demented mother, covered with bed sores, but her daughter’s effort to care for her that ultimately leads to her death at the hands of the mother: the burden of looking after her literally crushes her to death.  Like all of Djurberg’s work, the film is very painterly, bridging the gap between film, sculpture and painting. She has stated that the writings of Georges Bataille, that she encountered as a student, made an impact on her, as the scatological and anxious nature of her work attests. Ironic, humorous, terrifying, cruel and tender, Once Removed…, is typical of Djurberg’s animalistic vision.","In the late 1990s, Nathalie Djurberg started to work with Super 8 film, then video, staging plasticine models or puppets. Her animations are short narratives, fairy tales or nightmares for adults in cynical representations of relations between humans and animals. Reminiscent of the Czech Surrealist Jan Svankmajer’s clay animation films, as well as more recent work by Claes Oldenburg or Paul McCarthy, they push the boundaries of what is sacrilegious in art, eroticism and cinema. Glass or ceramic sculptures and installations add actual object-hood to her cartoon-like creations. The accompanying music is generally by Hans Berg.“Immersion in the dark vortex where things are carnal and sexual, humiliating and shameful, coagulated as exemplars of familial and erotic relationships of subjection, animalism and irreverence, is the procedure Nathalie Djurberg adopts to show the despoliation process experienced by the individual”.

Nathalie Djurberg,"Apparently Djurberg’s mother made a puppet theater and traveled around Göteborg performing during her childhood. This short story of a young man initially listening to birdsong in a city, suddenly confronted to warfare and wounded, could visually resemble child’s doll game or mise en scène, with a high dose of cynicism and violence. The figure, Hans, is attended to by two nurses whose raw discussion appears in speech bubbles: “we’ll have to amputate”. Djurberg employs the full formal potential of the clay material and basic building blocks to emphasize the morphing messiness and randomness of destruction. The scenario ends with the ironic comment about him now being “happy and useless”.  “One of the first films I made, Hans förlorar sina båda armar och ben (2004), was pretty much about me and my relationship to harm at that time. The idea came from a dream I had. I dreamed that someone was trying to save the world, and then he lost both his arms and legs, but he was still trying to help by cleaning the street that really smelled. My mother and my grandmother were standing there looking at him and saying to each other things like “oh, look, he’s so useless”, “yeah, but he’s happy, useless and happy.” I was initially devastated by this dream, but then I began to think it was funny. I thought I wasn’t allowed to think it was funny because I really didn’t want him to lose his arms and legs. When you are not allowed to do something, you become attracted to it.” Quoted in “Germano Celant – Nathalie Djurberg”, in Nathalie Djurberg. Turn Into Me, Milan, Fondazione Prada, 2008, p. 193.","In the late 1990s, Nathalie Djurberg started to work with Super 8 film, then video, staging plasticine models or puppets. Her animations are short narratives, fairy tales or nightmares for adults in cynical representations of relations between humans and animals. Reminiscent of the Czech Surrealist Jan Svankmajer’s clay animation films, as well as more recent work by Claes Oldenburg or Paul McCarthy, they push the boundaries of what is sacrilegious in art, eroticism and cinema. Glass or ceramic sculptures and installations add actual object-hood to her cartoon-like creations. The accompanying music is generally by Hans Berg.“Immersion in the dark vortex where things are carnal and sexual, humiliating and shameful, coagulated as exemplars of familial and erotic relationships of subjection, animalism and irreverence, is the procedure Nathalie Djurberg adopts to show the despoliation process experienced by the individual”.

Dennis Adams,"The video Make down is a 34 minute sequence shot that shows the artist removing make-up in front of a mirror. The peculiarity of the scene consists in two symbolic details: first, the make-up itself, covering his face, hair and torso – a thick kaki layer, reminding of military camouflage – and second, the paper used to remove the make-up – black and white prints of stills taken from Gillo Pontecorvo’s 1965 film, “La bataille d’Alger”  ( The Battle of Algiers). These still images put together recreate a sequence in which a young Algerian woman takes off her veil and puts on Western make-up. This disguise will help her pass the border and place a bomb in the French area of Algiers. Censured in France when it came out, the movie combines history and feminist activism; it may also be reinterpreted today in relation to the recent history of terrorism. The video goes with an installation: a vitrine enclosing the 96 prints soiled by the make-up, the remains of the artist’s performance, as if it were a reliquary. Compared to the terrorist’s gesture, the action is performed backwards by the artist, which could suggest the impossibility of having a unique reading of history.","Since 1998, through site specific works, often in public spaces, or video works, Dennis Adams focuses on ambiguous characters, condemned by our recent history,  revealing traumas or collective amnesia phenomena. The specific episodes from 20th or 21st century history he refers to find a relevance in today’s sensitive actuality. Dennis Adams plays with the ideological power of images, by referring to cinema and media images, yet leaving their meaning open to interpretation: he does not state clearly his political stance, but underlines the complexity of history and lets the spectator form his own opinion.Dennis Adams was born in Des Moines, Iowa, in 1948.

Dennis Adams,"Observing the sky after 11 September 2001, Dennis Adams photographed elements which had been lifted by drafts and were floating above the city of New York. The artist was only able to identify the objects after developing and enlarging the prints: you can read “He’s no terrorist”. The front page of the newspaper thrusts back to ‘the event’ of the 21st century and is revealed only through the detailed observation of the image; the painful twist of the newspaper could be a rustling wing. The simplicity of the process gives the work a poetic and prophetic dimension: a slight debris of a society, suspended between the sky and the earth in a blue infinite, sad news taken elsewhere, pieces of paper disintegrating. Violence, fracas and horror are audible in the silence of the image. These debris are transfigured into the silence of the victims flying towards a blue eternity. The artist pays a modest and painful homage. There is no taking sides, no judgment, just a flight in the sky. Dennis Adams sounds out collective memory, the public sphere, the urban context in their relations to art.","Since 1998, through site specific works, often in public spaces, or video works, Dennis Adams focuses on ambiguous characters, condemned by our recent history,  revealing traumas or collective amnesia phenomena.

Michel François,"In Michel François’s work, « it is the real, physical and emotional experience that stimulates creation which is therefore highly charged with a vital force. There lies also the profoundly and clandestine figurative nature of his work » (Guillaume Désanges). Contamination is a constant in Michel François’s work. Contamination (Pommes) starts from the observation of a rotten apple that contaminates its healthy neighbor. This can be perceived as a classical sculpture, due to the manual labour involved – the apples are wooden sculptures – and the theme of a still life, but this work is also a three-dimensional drawing that gives the impression that the still life has managed to get away… It leaves an imprint on the wall in the form of a trail of burnt charcoal marking the passage of time in space thus referring to entropy and paradoxically to the living.","Michel François was born in 1956 in Saint Truiden, Belgium.

Gabriel Orozco,"Gabriel Orozco’s output is not tied to any single medium, but ranges from sculpture to readymades, assemblages of objects, and observations of movement and space. The artist uses objects or “poor” situations, found in the everyday landscape, natural or urban. By their division, their juxtaposition, or collage, inventing semantic or sensitive scenarios, always surprising, sometimes humorous and sometimes lyrical. Orzoco’s sculptural practice, by extension, is inseparable from his drawings, photographs, or films, and posits relationships of space while also disrupting our perception of objects. Orozco’s photography has diverse functions and roles: it serves to document his spontaneous actions, assembled situations, and ephemeral public sculptures. His photographs respond to the Duchampian concept of the “Readymade” by exploring how our built environments function as both setting and source for everyday art objects.","Gabriel Orozco could be described as a traveler-artist, without a fixed studio. He works following contexts and produces work that flows. “Special Service” (1997) is a collage on a plane ticket, and indicates nomadism, between territories. The artist, who is the son of muralist Mario Orozco Riviera, questions the boundaries of his artistic identity in Mexico. In “Crazy tourist” (1991), Orozco creates a situation with oranges in the Brazilian market tables in a desert. The artist uses objects or “poor” situations, found in the everyday landscape, natural or urban. By their division, their juxtaposition, or collage, inventing semantic or sensitive scenarios, always surprising, sometimes humorous and sometimes lyrical … The sculptural practice of the artist, inseparable from his drawings, photographs, or films, invents relationships of space, and disrupts our perception of objects.

This film, shown in continuous loop, has a run-time of just under 3 minutes, and is presented without sound. It captures a traditional Shisa (combination of a dog and lion from Okinawan mythology) animated by an invisible person. Meanwhile chickens walk or flutter across the screen. The slow motion footage combines centuries old ceremony with daily life, to produce an otherworldly situation.

Laetitia Sonami,"Although at first the work Sounds of War presents itself with a degree of playfulness and humour, a close inspection reveals its painful undertone. The sound installation by Laetitia Sonami is comprised by a series of toilet plungers retrofitted with speakers that audiences are encouraged to engage with. As viewers interact with the modified domestic objects, placing them over their ears, a soundtrack plays audio sourced by the artist from Youtube videos, which feature the haunting voices of women and children in several war zones (Srebrenica, Darfur, Fallujah, Gaza and Iraq). There’s an additional image accompanying the installation, featuring the darkened silhouette of a woman over a bright, hot-pink background. Emulating a popular advertising campaign where Apple introduced personal listening devices and the idea of a ‘personalised soundtrack’, Sonami highlights the unfathomable contrast between the sonic presence of bodies surrounded by either privilege or devastation and war.","Based in San Francisco, Laetitia Sonami is a French-born electronic composer, performer, sound installation artist and educator. She came to prominence in the late 70s through her pioneering work in the electronic music scene at a time where few female artists were experimenting with sound and technology. Her key early performances involved a self-designed wearable instrument called the ‘Lady’s Glove,’ which was a combination of black lycra fabric and electronic sensors that tracked the movement of her fingers, hand and arm, and transformed them into sound. In more recent installations, Sonami has focused on embedding everyday objects with kinetic and sonic personalities, applying new technology and media to her compositions, as well as combining text, music, and incorporating found sound. An important part of her sound performances is a focus on presence and engagement, often requiring interactivity from the audience. Her most recent projects include the design of a new instrument, the Spring Spyre, which is based on the use and application of neural networks.",Sounds of War,Americas,"['war.n.01', 'sound.n.01', 'woman.n.01', 'ad.n.01', 'audience.n.01', 'viewing_audience.n.01', 'degree.n.01', 'contrast.n.01', 'voice.n.01', 'popular.a.01', 'background.n.01', 'child.n.01', 'presence.n.01', 'personal.a.01', 'idea.n.01', 'body.n.01', 'object.n.01', 'video.n.01', 'series.n.01', 'image.n.01']","['war_zone.n.01', 'sound.n.01', 'inequality.n.01', 'ad.n.01', 'apple.n.02', 'soundtrack.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_Sonami-Sounds-of-War-WEB.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_Sonami-Sounds-of-War-WEB-256x300.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/sounds-of-war/,"['Politics/1.8333333333333335', 'Society/1.0']","['Politics', 'Society']",2.8333333333333335,"['Inequality/1.8333333333333335', 'Economy/1.0']","['Inequality', 'Economy']",2.8333333333333335,"['Individual_Personal/21.03369963369964', 'Material_Physical/16.309157509157515', 'Cultural/10.559706959706961']","['Individual_Personal', 'Material_Physical', 'Cultural']",47.902564102564114,"['Mind/7.503296703296703', 'Space/6.346153846153846', 'Culture/5.5769230769230775']","['Mind', 'Space', 'Culture']",19.426373626373625,0.0,0.0
Kamau Amu Patton,"Kamau Amu Patton’s painting Static Field I originates from a system of electronic and digital media. The image we see on the canvas was created by pointing a camera into its output—a gallery wall—and subsequently generating a feedback loop. Patton then records the distorted image, digitizes it and prints the file onto unprimed canvas with the help of a machine. Since canvas is a porous surface when unprimed, two people need to gradually spray the canvas with water and smooth out the wet surface in order for the machine’s potter arm to work. The result is a choreography between two people and a machine, working together in a way that is uncomfortable or unusual and constantly learning from each other. The distortion or visual noise we see—also called signature—emanates from the technology and the process itself. Similar to the familiar white noise we remember watching in our TVs, the noise is the result of atmospheric, electromagnetic, radio, and sometimes even thermal waves from nearby devices. Patton purposefully leaves this in to make the intangible tangible and capture traces of these invisible forms that are all around us.","Kamau Amu Patton is a collector of the intangible. Using—or misusing—electronic media, he gathers sound, colour, light, and radio waves, which he then transforms through the prism of digital technology into artworks. Video feedback from a camera pointed at a gallery wall or a radio signal from a nearby antenna are examples of some of the inputs Patton uses, which are subsequently processed, digitized, amplified or re-routed through complex loops of information. Patton’s interest, however, goes beyond the visual outputs that result from the systems he deploys. For him, these intangible forms—whether electromagnetic or audiovisual—are lifeforms from the digital world that we’ve created, and as such, extensions of our own consciousness. With this in mind, as part of his process, he often responds to specific documents, archives and stories of specific sites in order to engage with the social and metaphysical dimensions of the media he uses.",Static Field I,Americas,"['machine.n.01', 'surface.n.01', 'consequence.n.01', 'people.n.01', 'wave.n.01', 'television.n.01', 'field.n.01', 'invisible.a.01', 'familiar.a.01', 'trace.n.01', 'water.n.01', 'technology.n.01', 'digital.a.01', 'name.v.01', 'image.n.01', 'white.a.01', 'medium.n.01', 'camera.n.01', 'ocular.a.02', 'procedure.n.01', 'make.v.03', 'form.n.01']","['feedback.n.01', 'electromagnetic.a.01', 'digital.a.01', 'distorted_shape.n.01', 'loop.v.01', 'intangible.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_Kamau-Amu-Patton_Static-Field-1_WEB.png,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_Kamau-Amu-Patton_Static-Field-1_WEB-300x204.png,https://kadist.org/work/static-field-i/,"['Society/1.6666666666666667', 'Material_Physical/0.7692307692307693']","['Society', 'Material_Physical']",2.435897435897436,"['Economy/1.6666666666666667', 'Environmental/0.7692307692307693']","['Economy', 'Environmental']",2.435897435897436,"['Cultural/43.548427063132934', 'Society/16.129720606191203', 'Material_Physical/12.672333385568681']","['Cultural', 'Society', 'Material_Physical']",72.35048105489281,"['Media/13.634857789269557', 'Technology/10.672335344394169', 'Arts/9.821697909933205']","['Media', 'Technology', 'Arts']",34.12889104359693,0.8,0.0

Lutz Bacher,"Sweet Jesus is a sound installation by Lutz Bacher that consists of a found recording of James Earl Jones’ iconic voice reciting biblical genealogy from Matthew, Book 1. Lutz has edited the recording by slowing it down slightly and adding background sound from the same recording. In Lutz’s edit, these are all the names of the ancestors of Jesus leading up to Joseph, but she leaves Jesus out of it, then reverses chronologically.  As Jones reads, the sound of the names themselves cycle between common, vaguely familiar, and foreign to the point of sounding like a different language, forcing the listener to question the content and context, place and time continually, an exercise in questioning reality.","In a career spanning more than four decades, Lutz Bacher (born 1952, lives in New York) has built a highly heterogeneous oeuvre that defies classification. The American artist, who adopted her male pseudonym when she first started out, has produced conceptual work in a variety of media. Bacher’s photographs, sculptural arrangements, videos, sound pieces, and expansive installations incorporate images and objects that are fixed in collective memory and easily retrieved: press photographs of public figures that, copied several times over, begin to lead a strangely aesthetic new life, found objects from thrift shops she integrates into her installations as objets trouvés and readymades. Her appropriations draw on vernacular and pop culture sources such as dime novels, porn magazines, self-help literature, and paparazzi snapshots.

Santu Mofokeng,"Santu Mofokeng is a South African photographer.  Mofokeng was born in 1956 in Soweto.

He was part of the collective Africapix  From the “Radiant Landscapes” series, this work is part of Santu Mofokeng’s investigation on water. Polluted to a great extend in South Africa, water remains a synonym of purity and is part of many rituals.","The photographic artwork of Santu Mofokeng (b. Soweto, South Africa, 1956), also known as Mofokengâ, explores the complicated societal paradigm of South Africa. Exploring rural farm life, townships, religious rituals and the quotidian life of Black South Africans, Mofokeng’s artwork significantly contributes to a greater understanding of development and identity in the South African context.

Elisheva Biernoff,"In her recent work, Biernoff is interested in investigating fictions and fantasies embedded in the remnants of consumer culture (for example magazines) or through ephemera such as postcards and old photographs. Although the imagery present in her work might seem nostalgic upon first encounter, Biernoff’s complex tableaux often reveal the artist’s skeptical look towards her subjects matters. They Were Here (2010), constitutes a clear example. The 16 ft long tableau confronts the viewer with a seemingly paradisiacal scene: a tropical deserted island with white sands and blooming trees appears to be a coveted destination. However the scene quickly turns into a dystopian image, once one pays attention to the small details camouflaged inside it: an erupting volcano or a dead bird. Biernoff places a pair of binoculars in front of the painting to reinforce this idea. Looking through their fake mdf lenses, the painted landscape is rendered blurry. The whole scene acts up as the backdrop of a theater act and the prop quality of its elements suggests a certain lightness associated with utopian dreams.","Elisheva Biernoff’s work engages and reconsiders the tradition of painting in an interesting way, often taking source material from media or recreating photographs through a careful trompe d’oeil technique. Thus, her work engages in the discussion of re-representation through painting, not aiming to portray any given reality faithfully but rather as the ideal way to engage with a subject matter that explores the intersection between myths, fictions and fantasies. In some cases, her works also address particular ecological concerns.",They Were Here,Americas,"['scene.n.01', 'lens.n.01', 'theater.n.01', 'magazine.n.01', 'backdrop.n.01', 'pair.n.01', 'brush.n.06', 'matter.n.01', 'island.n.01', 'dream.n.01', 'fantasy.n.01', 'tree.n.01', 'details.n.01', 'complex.a.01', 'fiction.n.01', 'quality.n.01', 'attention.n.01', 'elements.n.01', 'idea.n.01', 'white.a.01', 'culture.n.01', 'spectator.n.01', 'landscape.n.01', 'photograph.n.01', 'image.n.01']","['eden.n.01', 'look.n.02', 'dystopia.n.02', 'popular.s.04', 'fiction.n.01', 'utopia.n.02']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/elisheva_biernoff_they_were_here_web.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/elisheva_biernoff_they_were_here_web-300x225.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/they-were-here/,"['Cultural/14.878280542986428', 'Individual_Personal/4.198529411764706', 'Material_Physical/2.533333333333333']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Material_Physical']",21.610143288084465,"['Fantasy/12.57058823529412', 'Spirituality/1.6985294117647058', 'Arts/1.5384615384615385']","['Fantasy', 'Spirituality', 'Arts']",15.807579185520364,"['Cultural/43.694200766030754', 'Individual_Personal/26.8517902032608', 'Material_Physical/13.363614163614166']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Material_Physical']",83.90960513290571,"['Mind/11.110439560439561', 'Media/10.308957159111959', 'Fantasy/9.048529411764708']","['Mind', 'Media', 'Fantasy']",30.46792613131623,1.0,0.3333333333333333

Ford never faulted his own planning, but instead blamed the “inhospitable” Brazilian landscape.

Jiang Zhi,"5 is a three channel video about the dualities of death and resurrection, reminiscence and fantasy, chronological and retrospective narration. The main video features two dancers intertwining, caressing in trancelike movements, with intimacy eventually leading to scarring and bleeding. Towards the end, the trace of bodily movements and fluids crescendo in an image of a skull in a synthesis of performance, painting and theater.  To the artist, the skull of smeared fluid can be considered an allegory to Zygmunt Mauman’s concept of “liquid love,” where the loosening up of traditional bonds becomes possible due to increased social mobility. Modernity forces one to make provisional bonds that are more fluid and liquid in nature as many are torn between freedom and security. Thus, stricken by a liquid love, the amorous protagonists of the piece, enraptured in a fluxus of pain and eros, unable to transcend duality, leaves only an image of passion and death in the final tableau.","Jiang Zhi represents a generation of artists whose practice developed against the backdrop of experimental art in China in the 1990s, during which a series of social and cultural transformation occurred in the country. His work actively deals with issues such as body, gender, identity, consumerism, conflict, fear, power, and temporality, and often involves recent social events.

Felipe Arturo,"Defined as entropy, the second law of thermodynamics proposes that energy is more easily dispersed than it is concentrated. One basic illustration of entropy is to imagine white and black sand: once mixed together, it is highly unlikely that the contrasting grains of sand can be separated and restored to their original distinct color groups. Arturo’s Trópico Entrópico (Entropic Tropics, 2012) considers the colonization of the American continent as a similarly irreversible process of cultural entropy. His inspiration derives from a place near Manaus in the Brazilian Amazon, where the Black River meets with the sandy-colored Solimões River, producing a river of two colors that extends over ten kilometers. In the late nineteenth century, the Brazilian rubber barons decided to commemorate this impressive natural phenomenon by covering the main square of Manaus with a design of black-and-white waveforms made from stones. The square is known as the Encontro das aguas (Meeting of the Waters). Decades later, Roberto Burle Marx used this same pattern in his famous Copacabana walkway in Rio de Janeiro. Since then, the design has spread across the continent to Lima, Bogotá, Cali, and beyond. Trópico entrópico uses this pattern to produce entropy in the exhibition space. Sugar, the material used, signifies one of many economic motivators for colonialism. Visitors are invited to collectively dissolve this modern design by walking on the brown and white sugar, and participating in its entropic mixing.","Felipe Arturo considers elements from urbanism, architecture, and art in relation to politics, history, geography, and economy. His works and projects often manifest as sculptures, installations, or videos, departing from concepts such as structure, sequence, and matter. They are deeply influenced by vernacular architecture and construction techniques, and reflect processes of assimilation and resistance to colonial and postcolonial processes. He frequently combines the language and materials of Modernism (e.g., concrete) with the informal methods of autoconstrucción (self-construction).",Trópico entrópico,Americas,"['river.n.01', 'design.n.01', 'square.n.01', 'form.n.03', 'white.a.01', 'visitor.n.01', 'phenomenon.n.01', 'late.a.01', 'black.n.01', 'rock.n.01', 'celebrated.s.01', 'colors.n.01', 'modern.a.01', 'economic.a.01', 'produce.v.01', 'century.n.01', 'american.a.01', 'natural.a.01', 'original.s.01', 'color.n.01', 'black.a.01', 'cultural.a.01', 'procedure.n.01', 'material.n.01', 'space.n.01']","['disorder.n.01', 'sugar.n.01', 'colonialism.n.01', 'form.n.03', 'floor.n.01', 'history.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/felipe_arturo_tropico_entropico_web.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/felipe_arturo_tropico_entropico_web-300x200.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/tropico-entropico/,"['Society/7.5523257616136865', 'Politics/4.016965490649701', 'Cultural/2.6527777777777777']","['Society', 'Politics', 'Cultural']",14.222069030041165,"['Violence/2.4656346749226006', 'Power/2.307692307692308', 'History/1.7777777777777777']","['Violence', 'Power', 'History']",6.551104760392686,"['Material_Physical/14.653724053724059', 'Cultural/14.210917187387778', 'Individual_Personal/9.657875457875459']","['Material_Physical', 'Cultural', 'Individual_Personal']",38.522516698987296,"['Space/7.235042735042734', 'Arts/5.534640522875817', 'Time/4.123809523809524']","['Space', 'Arts', 'Time']",16.893492781728074,0.3333333333333333,0.0
Pia Camil,"Camil has made numerous paintings and photographs of halted projects along Mexico’s highways (she calls them “highway follies”), and of abandoned billboards that look like theater curtains dramatizing failed capitalist strategies. (Espectacular, the colloquial Spanish term for “billboard,” also translates more literally as “spectacle,” and of course recalls Guy Debord’s famous 1967 book The Society of the Spectacle.) In Mexico, the urban landscape has been taken over by billboards; they are totally integrated into the landscape. With overuse and reuse, they get scrapped, reshuffled, and recycled. In Espectacular (cortina) (Spectacular [Curtain], 2012), Camil abstracts such billboards into a multicolored fabric curtain to probe the multiple meanings of espectacular. The curtain is intended to work not only as a three-dimensional painting, but also as a screen that obstructs or conceals another space, causing the viewer to wonder: if nothing is on the other side of the curtain, who is the audience and who are the actors?","Through her installations and performance-based work, Pia Camil demonstrates a keen interest in failure. She often explores urban ruins—decay associated with the Mexican urban landscape, and specifically traces of modernist culture and art history that have been left behind. By incorporating appropriation and performance methods, Camil enacts a critical questioning of previously identified discourses, deconstructing preestablished references in order to generate a sense of estrangement in which she can explore the political connotations of the use of space.",Espectacular cortina,Americas,"['mexico.n.01', 'landscape.n.01', 'theater.n.01', 'scheme.n.01', 'actor.n.01', 'multiple.a.01', 'fabric.n.01', 'celebrated.s.01', 'audience.n.01', 'screen.n.01', 'book.n.01', 'urban.a.01', 'society.n.01', 'meaning.n.01', 'undertaking.n.01', 'spectator.n.01', 'space.n.01', 'photograph.n.01']","['abstraction.n.04', 'handicraft.n.01', 'commercialization.n.01', 'space.n.03', 'craft.n.04', 'digit.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/pia_camil_espectacular_cortina_web.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/pia_camil_espectacular_cortina_web-300x223.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/espectacular-cortina/,"['Cultural/7.586515307877536', 'Material_Physical/6.007692307692308', 'Society/2.426373626373626']","['Cultural', 'Material_Physical', 'Society']",16.020581241943468,"['Arts/4.319573443412453', 'Land/3.207692307692308', 'Media/2.4891640866873064']","['Arts', 'Land', 'Media']",10.016429837792067,"['Cultural/22.421407961177792', 'Society/14.79294871794872', 'Material_Physical/7.065182186234818']","['Cultural', 'Society', 'Material_Physical']",44.27953886536133,"['Arts/8.576646556058321', 'Urbanization/5.774358974358974', 'Media/5.727350427350427']","['Arts', 'Urbanization', 'Media']",20.078355957767723,1.0,0.6666666666666666
Adriana Martínez,"Her 2015 work Orión is a black flag-like cloth with glow-in-the-dark symbols embroidered in the shape of the constellation. In the place of stars, Martínez has substituted the logos of international corporations and entities that use stars as their symbol; celestial navigation commanded by the logic of international corporations. Easily spotted is the smiling face of the Carl’s Jr. / Hardee’s logo, the three-pronged Mercedes-Benz emblem, Walmart’s six-pointed asterisk, and the starry cluster of the Subaru shield.","Adriana Martínez is obsessed with ideas and entities that extend past national and regional borders. Martinez makes work that wrestles with the global economy through simple gestures conceived with a lightness of hand. Thought of temporally, many of her artworks can be described as quick: easily read, they come across like nimble jabs, the most succinct and articulate rebuttals. Martínez is conceptual in her approach to making art, often writing out her ideas in lieu of the traditional artist sketch. She is not concerned with the traditional skills required to realize her works—those, like the commodities she often works with, are easily traded—but is more interested in the process of imagining and articulating a certain point of view. She works with everyday and readymade objects often, pulling from the mass market and our image-rich global culture to comment on the very proliferation of those images (and the materials and peoples that they stand in for) around the world.",Orión,Americas,"['star.n.01', 'symbol.n.01', 'fabric.n.01', 'shape.n.01', 'black.a.01']","['corporation.n.01', 'economy.n.01', 'capitalism.n.01', 'criticism.n.02', 'globalization.n.01', 'power.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_orion-web.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_orion-web-300x240.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/orion/,"['Society/5.435897435897436', 'Cultural/2.6842105263157894', 'Politics/2.511655011655012']","['Society', 'Cultural', 'Politics']",10.631762973868238,"['Economy/5.435897435897436', 'Power/2.511655011655012', 'Media/1.6842105263157894']","['Economy', 'Power', 'Media']",9.631762973868238,"['Material_Physical/8.656776556776556', 'Cultural/7.384615384615384', 'Society/3.91025641025641']","['Material_Physical', 'Cultural', 'Society']",19.95164835164835,"['Space/7.823443223443223', 'Design/3.3076923076923075', 'Arts/2.5384615384615383']","['Space', 'Design', 'Arts']",13.669597069597069,0.6666666666666666,0.0
Shimon Minamikawa,"In Play, the image comes from a fashion magazine from the 1950’s (USA) whose theme is costume sportswear from the 19th century. The image was first used in a series involving  playing cards which have subsequently gone on to be used in a series of performances. There is cultural contextual displacement and confusion which is presented in the work which embodies the sense of –Play– that was introduced into Shimon’s work.","Since the beginning of his career, Minamikawa Shimon has made work that deviates from conventional painting and other formats. From portraits made with pale tones to abstract paintings using brilliant fluorescent colors, and a series called Sign Boards, in which he applies paint directly to an easel, Minamikawa’s works assume a variety of forms. And by showing a number of works with different qualities alongside each other, the artist rearranges the meaning of each individual piece, and turns the space into a work of art.

Aki Sasamoto,"Poetry Light Stool evokes the spirit of Fluxus, the intermedia movement that encouraged artmaking to be simple, fun, and address everyday life. Aki Sasamoto does just that with this ironic work that revolves around found objects, namely a four-legged wooden stool to which she attached four wheels. Coiling above is a goose-neck cable that rises up and culminates in a globe lamp. The artist clothed the glowing orb with a pair of ladies’ panties.  Sasamoto exposes what we hide—namely apparel that is revealed in private by the wearer and only visible to those who might be present during (un)dressing. The old saying defines identity as skin deep. Sasamoto thus participates in today’s questioning about race, gender, and identity plumage, which we conceal and reveal.","Aki Sasamoto is an artist whose mediums include performance, sculpture, dance, and whatever other form it takes to get her ideas across. She often collaborates with scientists, scholars, and other artists in the visual arts, music, and dance. She plays multiple roles as performer, dancer, sculptor, writer, and director.  Her work has been presented both in performing as well as visual art venues, in white box galleries, and black box theaters, as well as in offbeat public sites, in Tokyo, New York and Europe.",Poetry Light Stool,Asia,"['identity.n.01', 'race.n.01', 'wooden.s.01', 'everyday.s.01 life.n.01', 'spirit.n.01', 'pair.n.01', 'private.a.01', 'uncover.v.01', 'earth.n.01', 'visible.a.01', 'simple.a.01', 'everyday.s.01', 'light.n.01', 'motion.n.03', 'object.n.01', 'life.n.01']","['everyday.s.01', 'identity.n.01', 'privacy.n.01', 'familiarity.n.03', 'wit.n.01', 'sex.n.04']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_AS_W034-WEB.png,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_AS_W034-WEB-300x200.png,https://kadist.org/work/poetry-light-stool/,"['Individual_Personal/7.7979797979797985', 'Material_Physical/1.8', 'Society/1.0']","['Individual_Personal', 'Material_Physical', 'Society']",10.597979797979798,"['Identity/5.7979797979797985', 'Body/1.0', 'Emotion/1.0']","['Identity', 'Body', 'Emotion']",7.7979797979797985,"['Individual_Personal/10.007070707070708', 'Material_Physical/9.822008547008547', 'Politics/4.802614379084967']","['Individual_Personal', 'Material_Physical', 'Politics']",24.631693633164222,"['Identity/4.797979797979798', 'Materiality/3.435897435897436', 'Geopolitics/3.2026143790849675']","['Identity', 'Materiality', 'Geopolitics']",11.4364916129622,0.6666666666666666,0.3333333333333333
Finger Pointing Worker,"During Summer 2011, few months after the nuclear accident, performance artist Kota Takeuchi got a job at the Fukushima Daiichi plant and kept a blog about the labour conditions of clean-up workers. In 2012, he exhibited an ‘anonymous’ video taken from the 24-hour live feed on TEPCO’s website that monitored the clean-up activities. The video, which then went viral in Japan and became known as the “Finger Pointing Worker”, captured someone in a protective suit, entering the frame and pointing his finger at the video surveillance installed by TEPCO on the nuclear plant site. He remained there for nearly 20 minutes, in a public act of defiance and accusation. Almost the same duration than Vito Acconci in his piece “Centers” (1971), a reference assumed by this “Finger Pointing Worker” as he said that his action was a kind of homage to Vito Acconci piece.","“Finger Pointing Worker” is a man who pointed at the public live camera in Fukushima nuclear power station after the disaster in 2011. Kota Takeuchi is the agent of him.  Kota Takeuchi has always been interested in the way visual imagery in the public domain can sway the common consciousness.

Ruby Sky Stiler,"The depiction of the female figure in the sculptures remains an economic, canny composition of geometric abstractions in a Modernist spirit. Yet rather than provide us with the layers of information found in her wall reliefs, the sculptures exclusively frame space. In place of the tactile surfaces that can be carved into and drawn on, the sculptures’ outlines provide multiple perspectives on to their surroundings, and additionally unto themselves. The lines are simultaneously descriptive and obstructive, creating screens that allow transparency only to reveal another set of images. Stiler portrays the female figure and our relationship to it as anything but; fully realized yet hard to decipher, enigmatic, and unrepeatable.","Ruby Sky Stiler has established a visual language in which historical periods, art movements, and spatial dimensions readily coexist. Her signature wall reliefs transform an inventory of studio castoffs into rhythmic puzzles that draw attention equally to their surfaces and to the discrete shapes contained within, accumulating patterns and textures to create dense portraits or geometric configurations.

Luciano Figueiredo,"Figueiredo’s succinct forms are rendered in bright hues of yellow, red, green, and blue, with white and black defining positive and negative spaces within the overall geometry. His Revelos are part painting, part relief, and part sculpture—they separate from the wall, creating spatial complexities within their bounds, and imply movement through the simplicity of their shapes. Though based on the shape of a simple square, each Revelo animates beyond that limitation, the folded and layered canvas sheets, the cuts and slices of contrasting paints creating movement from stasis. These works recall the in-between geometry of a turning page, evoking Figueiredo’s obsession with books and newspapers, and recalling the frozen time of a still photographic image.","Brazilian artist Luciano Figueiredo works with color, form, volume, and light in his exquisite wall-bound compositions. Figueiredo began making paintings in the 1960s, and his origins and his output place him in line with Brazilian Constructivism, a modernist movement that emphasized geometric forms and rational designs.

Nicholas Buffon,"A series of works from 2016 document his neighborhood, replicating buildings and businesses he frequents within four blocks of his New York apartment. Made out of foam, paper, glue, and paint, these miniaturized buildings (a bank, a bar, a Laundromat, and the Rite Aid building where Buffon shops) impart a tenderness and a nostalgia that outsizes their diminutive scale. Like works by other artists who recreate objects or elements from their everyday life, Buffon’s storefronts are perfectly imperfect, the wobbled lines reiterating their handmade quality. Capturing these mundane structures in faithful detail, Buffon aims to capture a moment and a place; his final objects reinforce, however, that both space and time are ever changing.","Working in paint, performance, and small, diorama-like wall sculptures, Seattle transplant Nicholas Buffon responds to his context through intimate gestures, examinations, and recreations.

Phillip Maisel,"While his works can function as abstract, they are very much rooted in physicality and the possibilities that are inherent in the materials themselves. Elements used in various stages of photographic processes (color filters, glassine, and prints themselves) are integrated back into the artwork either as part of the sculpture or as collage elements that are later added to the print. In some of the works, Maisel cuts into the prints themselves. This re-working further shifts the spatial relationships within the surface and acknowledges the photograph as an object in and of itself.

Edgardo Aragón,"Efectos de familia (Family Effects, 2007–9) is a series of 13 videos that dramatize an array of abusive events derived from Edgardo Aragón’s family’s history—specifically its involvement with organized crime. Each episode is an action performed by some combination of his two young cousins, nephew, and younger brother. In one, a boy is shot to death inside a pickup truck. In another, two of them endure a brick-carrying competition. In another, a boy digs his grave. The work is about a collective social condition of survival and endurance, and it is inextricable from the broader context of contemporary Mexico, especially its skyrocketing crime rates and the disaster of its national economy. By using reenactment as an artistic medium, Aragón attempts to educate his young family members to avoid criminal entanglements.","Edgardo Aragón’s works employ reenactment to reflect the everyday reality of rural Mexico. Using narratives inspired by the particularities of their respective local contexts, Aragón evokes events—some with very violent undertones—and shapes them into scenes molded by landscapes. His work also addresses points of familial and social inheritance that are conditioned by the local environment, creating a personal body of work recounted through poetic narratives.

Pedro Reyes,"Pedro Reyes’s Los Mutantes (Mutants, 2012) is composed of 170 plates that combine characters from ancient and modern mythologies. As in a periodic table, animals and objects are combined with humans (male or female), providing a rational framework for the irrational products of human imagination. A Cartesian matrix such as this must follow certain rules. All figures are half-human, half-something. Animal/cartoon characters that speak, such as Fritz the Cat or Donald Duck, are excluded, as well as oddities and chimeras without recognizable human features. Their arrangement results in combinations such as fish plus woman equals mermaid; bull plus man equals minotaur, and so on. The juxtapositions cross figures from pop culture with those from ancient myths, encouraging us to notice similarities between religious icons and comic-book characters. All of these “mutants” reveal something about our desire to extract qualities of animals or objects and empower ourselves with them. Mythologies are a reflection of the paradigms of their time, and this kind of periodic table presents a rational framework to categorize irrational products of the imagination.","Pedro Reyes’s works traverse the worlds of art, film, architecture, design, social criticism, and pedagogy. Educated as an architect, Reyes draws on this training to engage with utopian aspirations and the ongoing legacy of Modernism, often focusing on issues of scale and space while questioning pressing social issues through the incitement of individual or collective interaction. Although only a few of his works are directly located within the practice of building, almost all involve some kind of construction, whether they are objects, models, interiors, or social spaces. Reyes also makes use of strategies developed for communication or education, as well as everyday humor, to engage his audiences. Many of his works either allow large-scale public engagement or suggest a possible use: weapons turned to shovels, multilevel parks in old modernist buildings, and small spherical rooms. Like many avant-garde thinkers of the past, Reyes constructs new forms of architecture necessary for new ways of life.",Los Mutantes,Unspecified,"['imagination.n.01', 'animal.n.01', 'fictional_character.n.01', 'model.n.01', 'human.a.01', 'figure.n.01', 'world.n.08', 'rule.n.01', 'object.n.01', 'icon.n.01', 'agreement.n.04', 'combination.n.01', 'ancient.s.01', 'religious.s.01', 'feature.n.01', 'desire.n.01', 'quality.n.01', 'compose.v.01', 'modern.a.01', 'contemplation.n.02', 'woman.n.01', 'culture.n.01', 'time.n.01']","['mutant.a.01', 'mutate.v.01', 'periodic_table.n.01', 'mythology.n.01', 'juxtaposition.n.01', 'male.n.01', 'female.n.01', 'animal.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/pedro_reyes_los_mutantes_copy_0.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/pedro_reyes_los_mutantes_copy_0-300x137.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/los-mutantes/,"['Politics/2.4000000000000004', 'Individual_Personal/2.4000000000000004', 'Cultural/2.4000000000000004']","['Politics', 'Individual_Personal', 'Cultural']",7.200000000000001,"['Politics/1.6', 'Environmental/0.9333333333333333', 'Community/0.8']","['Politics', 'Environmental', 'Community']",3.333333333333333,"['Individual_Personal/35.88162093324631', 'Material_Physical/11.137429546717474', 'Cultural/8.579017490936996']","['Individual_Personal', 'Material_Physical', 'Cultural']",55.59806797090078,"['Emotion/12.381618381618384', 'Mind/11.125379625534425', 'Values/6.522058823529411']","['Emotion', 'Mind', 'Values']",30.029056830682222,0.6666666666666666,0.0
Edgar Orlaineta,"Edgar Orlaineta’s artistic practice recontextualizes aspects of modern design to reflect new contemporary values. In his sculptures, he adapts classic forms and imbues them with new social and aesthetic values. Solar Do (It-Yourself) Nothing Toy, After Charles Eames (2011) is a re-creation of Charles Eames’s famous Solar Do-Nothing Machine commissioned in 1958 by the aluminum company ALCOA. That colorful, dynamic toy is only remembered through images, since the original model is lost. It whirled around joyfully and was powered by the sun.

Voluspa Jarpa,"To make Minimal Secret (2012), Jarpa created sculptures based on pages of declassified CIA information about the United States’ involvement in Chile. The cutouts in the acrylic represent the content that was blacked out when the pages were released to the public. For Jarpa, that so much content from these documents was deleted before declassification is symptomatic of hysterical behavior, which, in Freudian psychoanalysis, results from the inability to deal with trauma. Jarpa reclaims the blots of the original documents as the structure of the artwork, mimicking the same denial of access that entered them into classification in the first place. By working at the juncture of the public and the secret, the artist aims to question how images and materials construct notions of public and private, transparency and opacity. The documents’ promise of disclosure ultimately materializes as repression, given that barely anything remains legible.","Voluspa Jarpa’s work is based upon a meticulous analysis of political, historical, and social documents from Chile and other Latin American countries, which she uses to develop a reflection on the concept of memory. Specifically exploring many facets of the cultural notion of trauma, her work might be seen as a subtle and covert examination of history, its subjectivities, constructions, and still-unresolved mysteries.

Ron Terada,"The three Maikos were included in Ron Terada’s 2008 exhibition, Voight–Kampf, at Catriona Jeffries gallery. More ambitious in size and subject matter, this show with its complex video installation marked a new path for Terada’s work. Voight-Kampf is based on a scene from Ridley Scott’s 1982 movie Blade Runner in which a giant advertising billboard in the midst of a dystopian city of Los Angeles in the future displays a geisha eating candy. Terada used this image as a point of departure to explore issues of racial identity, the nature of photographic representation, and the liminal space between fiction and reality. In each of the three Maiko photographs that accompanied the exhibition, a Caucasian woman poses a Geisha and look directly at the camera. The images reinforce the staged and artificial nature of racial categories and stereotypes, but also speak to the excesses brought about by an accelerated consumer culture.","Ron Terada belongs to a generation of Vancouver-based artists that follows the well-known Vancouver School of photoconceptualists which includes Jeff Wall, Stan Douglas, and Ian Wallace.

The final result is the three-dimensional experience of a reconstructed site. More than a mere play with optical illusions and perception, Soo’s operation plays with the idea of the original and the replica to comment on the illusory character of any reconstruction, reproduction, or representation.","Born in Singapore, raised in Malaysia, and based in Canada, artist and curator Mark Soo’s practice is concept-driven and research-based.

Ben Shaffer,"Ben Shaffer’s Ben Deroy (2007) is part performance, part self-portrait, and part spiritual vision. Often the artist works with the motifs of the counterculture and contemporary non-religious spiritualism. The figure hangs suspended—seemingly ascending—animation. The figure looks like some kind of countercultural superman empowered by myriad alternative experiences, as worthy of myth as the heralded Laocoön.","Ben Shaffer’s works are dynamic installations that integrate sculpture, painting, and performance. His complex pieces often require direct interaction from viewers, eschewing simple subject-object relationships in favor of relational negotiations. Through his makeshift neo- psychedelia, Shaffer explores the legacy of counter-cultural imagery, specifically its fragile utopic horizons and ever-receding promises of enlightenment and transcendence.

Allan Sekula,"San Pedro is a seaside city, part of the Los Angeles Harbor, sitting on the edge of a channel. California Stories: Attempt to correlate social class with elevation above main harbor channel (San Pedro, July 1975) (1973–2011) is a series of coupled gelatin silver prints that show the artist using his hand to measure the elevation of various pieces of real estate, ranging from a manicured mansion to a ramshackle beach house. A direct equation becomes evident between the social strata these homes represent and the height at which the artist holds his hand. By assigning a simple, visual value to an otherwise murky undercurrent, Sekula surfaces issues of class and subjects them to unconventional inquiry.","Allan Sekula was a Los Angeles–based photographer, intellectual, and critical essayist who explored issues of labor and globalization. His photographs and writings set out to picture and allegorize ignored inequities, opening them up to examination and discussion.

By inserting written comments like “not a straw,” “not a spoon,” “not a razor blade,” the artist equates the inspector with a cocaine user. In this way, with keen, deadpan humor, the artist refers to all the stereotypes and social clichés associated with drug abuse particularly in the 1970s.

John Houck,"Baby Shoes, Never Worn is part of photographer John Houck’s series of restrained still-life photographs capturing objects from his childhood. The image depicts a box, addressed to the artist’s mother, that once contained—it can be assumed—baby shoes. Houck layers the photograph with multiple exposures, lending an uneasy tripling effect to the static object. Borrowing his title from Ernest Hemingway’s enigmatic, apocryphal six-word novel (“For Sale: Baby Shoes, Never Worn”), Houck’s photograph engages the ideal and image of childhood from the distanced point of view of the camera’s lens.","An MFA graduate from UCLA, John Houck works primarily in the medium of photography and specializes in still-life vignettes. To make his works, Houck arranges an object on a sheet of paper, photographs, and prints it, then places that print back into a new composition, repeating the process again and again until arriving at an aggregate image. The layers appear to be digitally altered, but he does not utilize any postproduction interventions. But Houck is not a purist by any means; he is significantly influenced by his professional experience as a computer programmer, and his artistic methodology mirrors a kind of algorithmic code. By referencing a conventional artistic genre through an iterative and contingent process, Houck offers up photography as a mode of thought.","Baby Shoes, Never Worn",Americas,"['photograph.n.01', 'object.n.01', 'mother.n.01', 'box.n.01', 'multiple.a.01', 'photographer.n.01', 'image.n.01', 'position.n.03', 'camera.n.01', 'title.n.01', 'series.n.01']","['childhood.n.01', 'shoebox.n.02', 'multiply.v.02', 'layered.s.01', 'unreal.a.02', 'hemingway.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/john_houck_baby_shoes_never_worn_web.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/john_houck_baby_shoes_never_worn_web-222x300.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/baby-shoes-never-worn/,"['Individual_Personal/3.4835164835164836', 'Society/1.7692307692307692', 'Material_Physical/1.5384615384615385']","['Individual_Personal', 'Society', 'Material_Physical']",6.791208791208791,"['Familial/1.8571428571428572', 'Body/1.6263736263736264', 'Time/1.5384615384615385']","['Familial', 'Body', 'Time']",5.021978021978022,"['Cultural/12.302450980392159', 'Individual_Personal/5.953601953601953', 'Material_Physical/3.5378151260504205']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Material_Physical']",21.793868060044534,"['Politics/3.2', 'Culture/3.076923076923077', 'Media/2.6564102564102567']","['Politics', 'Culture', 'Media']",8.933333333333334,0.6666666666666666,0.0

Ari Marcopoulos,"A photograph of a tin box full of marijuana simply titled Green Box, speaks to the constantly changing status of the substance–once taboo or illicit, now a symbol of a growing industry in Northern California. In the past a photograph of marijuana would more likely be found in an evidence file than an art museum or gallery, but today continued debates about the legality of marijuana and the industry surrounding it has brought the substance into common public view. Green Box is a strong example of the current sociopolitical state of California and the grey areas that exist in legislature and at the same time illustrates the unavoidable commercialization of once underground cultures.","Dutch artist Ari Marcopoulos moved to the United States in 1980 and has become an important documentarian of American fringe culture over the last three decades.

George Pfau,"This work exemplifies George Pfau’s interest in zombies and liminal embodiment. In different ways, zombies are present here as an icon of coming apart, yet they retain a persistent thereness. In Zombie Swallows The World, the image of the figure is almost overcome by strong light that visually blows away the edges of the body. In Zombie Examined, the frayed edges of the body are undone by a clinical look, rather than a visual effect. The piece presents what is actually one of the clearer of Pfau’s zombie renderings, and certainly the most precisely illustrative in this set.","George Pfau’s work explores marginal and transitional states of being. Decaying bodies and exposed buildings populate his work. His interest in the in-between also extends to material techniques, as Pfau’s pieces are often built in layers and remain semi-transparent.

The slightest details are reproduced identically with great minutiae. The facial expressions are absurd, the prim attitude makes no sense. The blasé air of the actors (the artists themselves) creates a comic and ridiculous shift. This work is typical of Chung and Maeda’s artistic strategy in which the hoax is a pretext for rereading and although the artists are staging themselves, they are also intent on becoming absent. In this literal video remake, the artists question the modes of diffusion of images, copying, artistic territory, legitimacy and paternity.","Jay Chung and Takeki Maeda’s practice is characterized by performance, which often involves weighty unsettling humour. Concerned by popular and digital culture, art speculation and self-criticism they play with their presence and retreat, creating some emptiness which is conducive to reflexion.

Pauline Boudry and Renate Lorenz,"Salomania sees choreographer and filmmaker Yvonne Rainer and artist Wu Tsang rehearse scenes from Valda’s Solo, a chapter of a film Rainer made in 1972 after having seen women perform the dance of the seven veils in Alla Nazimova’s 1923 silent film Salomé.The script is based on the Biblical New Testament story of the Jewish princess Salomé, who in the Christian tradition has been depicted as an emblem of feminine seduction and danger. In the twentieth century, her character was made popular through English playwright Oscar Wilde’s famous theater piece, Salomé. Boudry and Lorenz’s video explores Salomé’s queer potential and the practice of drag performance, thus also reminding us that Nazimova herself was bisexual. Salomaniais therefore a historical reconstruction that not only recounts the history of the ballet, but also the history of how images and bodies have been imagined.","For several years now, artists Pauline Boudry and Renate Lorenz have been conducting research on the heritage of cultural and gender studies, concentrating primarily on gender discourses and the notion of queer. They are interested in historical figures who were marginalized because they incarnated a sexual “perversion” and who went on stage to seek some recognition in their time. These stigmatized characters are made visible once again by Boudry and Lorenz who revisit archives as a base for their films, installations and texts. These works demonstrate how visibility (since the beginning of the modern period) of these bodies allows for a claim to power, a certain glamour, and a form of recognition. Nevertheless it also contributes to making these bodies pathological or criminal, to devalue them. Their work ponders on the quasi-simultaneity of the invention of sexual perversions and photography as well as they link to colonial economy at the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th. Thus Boudry and Lorenz weave links between different epochs as if to readdress the notion of “normality”. Playing with the conventions of cross-dressing and fetishization, the exhibition of these characters is doubled up with a baroque mise en scène.",Salomania,Europe,"['dance.n.01', 'theater.n.01', 'perform.v.01', 'history.n.01', 'movie.n.01', 'picture.v.02', 'celebrated.s.01', 'popular.a.01', 'century.n.01', 'tradition.n.01', 'historical.a.01', 'establish.v.08', 'woman.n.01', 'fictional_character.n.01', 'performance.n.01', 'practice.n.01', 'scene.n.01', 'piece.n.01', 'body.n.01', 'narrative.n.01', 'video.n.01', 'image.n.01']","['normality.n.04', 'transgender.s.01', 'perversion.n.02', 'stigmatize.v.01', 'archive.n.01', 'human_body.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/photo3.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/photo3-300x199.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/salomania/,"['Individual_Personal/3.5123626373626373', 'Material_Physical/2.307692307692308', 'Society/1.8']","['Individual_Personal', 'Material_Physical', 'Society']",7.620054945054945,"['Space/2.307692307692308', 'Body/1.7980769230769231', 'Identity/1.7142857142857142']","['Space', 'Body', 'Identity']",5.820054945054945,"['Cultural/37.43473373032196', 'Individual_Personal/26.438878115348714', 'Material_Physical/22.632478941766873']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Material_Physical']",86.50609078743754,"['Arts/13.334383753501402', 'Culture/9.065928679163973', 'Mind/8.817022193492782']","['Arts', 'Culture', 'Mind']",31.217334626158156,0.6666666666666666,0.0
Charles Avery,"Charles Avery has been constructing a narrative in his work since 2004. Between fantasy and reality, The Islanders is a very particular universe he has created in which to gather his disparate ideas. His practice primarily involves drawing, sculptures, texts and installations which participate in the epic and dreamlike narrative whole in the course of making. “I discovered a way to create a place where I could lay out and rationalize according to the space rather than to logic. This place enables me to affirm relations between the different elements. Thus whatever I make or write, whatever the context in which the work operates, its ultimate and absolute meaning remains linked to The Island”.  Charles Avery has no interest in placing his work within the history of art, instead he is intent on constructing a autonomous environment, purposely distancing the public. “The spectator is a tourist, a traveler, a writer, a missionary, an itinerant, a bounty hunter, a pioneer, in this country.” Amongst Avery’s most renowned drawings with extremely composed figurative scenes, there are geographical maps that situate The Island in relation to a fictional archipelago Triangland. Untitled (Map) is one of the pieces that enables the viewer to comprehend the context of this archipelago as well as discover the topography of his account.","Charles Avery was born in 1973 in Oban, Isle of Mull, Scotland.

Will Rogan,"Shot in the streets of Tokyo, Collapse, is a meditation on the passing of time and on the complicated way in which we are smashed between the past and the future. The video follows a moped carrying a woman holding a very large mirror. The mirror is large enough that she can’t see what lies ahead, she can only see what has already come as reflections in the mirror. The video is flipped so that everything in the mirror is correct and everything else is reversed.","Based in the San Francisco Bay Area, Will Rogan’s practice reflects the poignant, the ironic, the disastrous, and the beautiful in his surrounding urban and domestic landscapes.

Eamon Ore-Giron,"Eamon Ore-Giron’s new commissioned video project Bite Work, is an experimental genre breaking video that is part-performance, part-conceptual and part-comical addressing issues of mediation, surveillance and trust. The main characters in the video wear traditional dance masks of “La Chonguinada” rituals from Peru and attempt to dance while being bitten by trained attacked dogs. Through this act, the dogs simultaneously become sculptural obstacles and dancers. The trained dogs, Belgian Malinois, have become the new darling and weapon for both the US military, Border Patrol and US law enforcement in their fight against terrorism and illegal immigration; and well known recently for being the dogs that helped capture and kill Osama Bin Laden. The musical narrative for the video is a free-form cumbia music composed by the artist and members of the Los Angeles-based band OJO that mixes hints of cumbia with electronic and ambient sounds. The video captures encounters between cultural memory and trauma by using both ritual and performance, yielding the appearance and disappearance of a hallucinatory narrative into a psychological sound experiment.","Eamon Ore-Giron’s paintings, works on paper and installations blend contemporary graphic design, folk and tourist art, and surrealism in a hybridity of Mexican, South American, Native-American, and other American cultures. Along with his collaborator Julio Cesar Morales,Ore-Giron creates DJ and audio culture forums under the name Los Jaichackers as well as his solo music as DJ LENGUA.",Bite Work,Americas,"['video.n.01', 'sound.n.01', 'surveillance.n.01', 'mask.n.01', 'dance.n.01', 'psychological.s.01', 'injury.n.01', 'brush.n.06', 'military.a.01', 'appearance.n.01', 'boundary_line.n.01', 'music.n.01', 'sculptural.a.01', 'compose.v.01', 'traditional.a.01', 'issue.n.01', 'narrative.s.01', 'fictional_character.n.01', 'memory.n.01', 'performance.n.01', 'undertaking.n.01', 'cultural.a.01', 'narrative.n.01']","['surveillance.n.01', 'ritual.a.01', 'trauma.n.02', 'humor.n.04', 'violence.n.01', 'watchdog.n.02']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/eamon_ore_giron_bite_work.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/eamon_ore_giron_bite_work-300x200.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/bite-work/,"['Politics/5.848868778280543', 'Society/5.488185017596782', 'Individual_Personal/4.883516483516483']","['Politics', 'Society', 'Individual_Personal']",16.220570279393808,"['Power/3.107692307692308', 'Violence/2.9411764705882355', 'Activism/1.7411764705882353']","['Power', 'Violence', 'Activism']",7.790045248868779,"['Cultural/26.311017577194054', 'Individual_Personal/22.44140365997952', 'Material_Physical/8.98602539531332']","['Cultural', 'Individual_Personal', 'Material_Physical']",57.7384466324869,"['Culture/8.969683257918552', 'Mind/8.959879336349927', 'Arts/8.030295195001077']","['Culture', 'Mind', 'Arts']",25.959857789269556,0.3333333333333333,0.0
Yoshua Okón,"Canned Laughter was Okón’s response to an invitation from Ciudad Juárez, Mexico,where artists were asked to create works based on their experience of the city. Okónfocused on Ciudad Juárez as a site for many ‘maquiladoras’ (factories) and on its role within the global context.      A mixed media and video installation, the work takes the form of a fictitious factory thatproduces canned laughter for sitcoms. The Factory’s name, Bergson, refers to a collection of essays studying laughter that were published by French philosopher Henri Bergson in 1900. Okón’s work Canned Laughter alludes to the dehumanization produced by mechanized processes and slavery in the age of globalization, as well as to the impossibility to translate and reproduce true emotions though technological means.","Working primarily in video, Okón combines the genre of documentary with performativeelements that together blur the boundary between reality and fiction. His video installations capture improvisational narratives created by the artist and his collaborators—performers willing to participate in a game of social chance that may easily spiral out of control. In them, the camera acts as a catalyst that unleashes his subjects, empowering them to act out an assumed character and in the process revealing their own awareness and perceptions.  Characterized by their uncomfortable, somber nature these works deliberately provoke viewers through confrontational humor as a way to achieve catharsis. His videos are used as a device to implicate audiences and also activate them as a participant, pressuring them to consider questions of social conduct and personal behavior within the context of the authoritative nation-state, and to question their own attitudes towards power, ethics, and prejudice vis-á-vis class, status, and marginality.  Described by Okón as near-sociological experiments, his works give the audience a unique insight into the subjects he portrays. Most importantly, they also evoke a sense of interconnectivity: deeply implicating us in issues that we may normally consider foreign or removed from our everyday lives.",Canned Laughter,Americas,"['factory.n.01', 'french.a.01', 'age.n.01', 'mexico.n.01', 'print.v.01', 'global.s.01', 'produce.v.01', 'function.n.03', 'establish.v.08', 'artist.n.01', 'context.n.01', 'medium.n.01', 'city.n.01', 'experience.n.01', 'procedure.n.01', 'make.v.03', 'form.n.01', 'video.n.01']","['automation.n.02', 'labor.n.01', 'parody.n.02', 'improvisation.n.01', 'artificiality.n.01', 'globalization.n.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/yoshua_okon_canned_laughter.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/yoshua_okon_canned_laughter-300x200.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/canned-laughter/,"['Cultural/8.063603063603063', 'Society/5.205128205128205', 'Politics/4.038461538461539']","['Cultural', 'Society', 'Politics']",17.30719280719281,"['Arts/5.6064602064602065', 'Power/3.269230769230769', 'Economy/2.769230769230769']","['Arts', 'Power', 'Economy']",11.644921744921746,"['Cultural/21.569203835380314', 'Society/12.508353084823673', 'Material_Physical/9.21395041147363']","['Cultural', 'Society', 'Material_Physical']",43.29150733167762,"['Media/8.419020685197154', 'Land/5.844719642242862', 'Urbanization/4.401307189542484']","['Media', 'Land', 'Urbanization']",18.665047516982497,0.6666666666666666,0.0

Jennifer Locke,"Choke documents the artist filming a wrestler “choking out” his teammate until he is unconscious. This closed circuit of dominance and submission between two powerful men, is echoed by the closed circuit of the video through which the viewer takes on the role of voyeur. The artist’s presence in the piece not only calls attention to its staging, but inverts the traditional power dynamic of the “male gaze” and gender roles.","Working in video and installation-based performance, Jennifer Locke stages physically intense actions in relation to the camera and specific architecture in order to explore the unstable nature of artist/model/camera/audience hierarchies. These actions focus on cycles of physicality and visibility, and draw from her experiences as a professional dominatrix, champion submission wrestler, and artist’s model. Locke often creates a separation between her live actions and the audience through the use of material barriers, live video feeds, multiple camera perspectives, wireless microphones, and mini-cameras. These audio-visual reiterations produce a ripple effect, flattening, repeating, echoing, amplifying, and displacing the action by turning it —as well as the audience performing its own spectatorship— into an image of itself.",Choke,Americas,"['function.n.03', 'gaze.n.01', 'attention.n.01', 'traditional.a.01', 'presence.n.01', 'document.n.01', 'power.n.01', 'spectator.n.01', 'piece.n.01', 'video.n.01']","['sex.n.04', 'wrestling.n.02', 'voyeurism.n.01', 'violence.n.01', 'gaze.n.01', 'film.v.01']",https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/jennifer_locke_choke_.jpg,https://kadist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/jennifer_locke_choke_-300x204.jpg,https://kadist.org/work/choke/,"['Individual_Personal/4.8', 'Society/2.7411764705882353', 'Politics/2.541176470588235']","['Individual_Personal', 'Society', 'Politics']",10.08235294117647,"['Body/3.0', 'Violence/1.9411764705882353', 'Activism/1.7411764705882353']","['Body', 'Violence', 'Activism']",6.682352941176471,"['Material_Physical/6.825940725940725', 'Cultural/6.376923076923077', 'Individual_Personal/5.123809523809523']","['Material_Physical', 'Cultural', 'Individual_Personal']",18.326673326673326,"['Materiality/3.4025641025641025', 'Power/2.511655011655012', 'Language/2.307692307692308']","['Materiality', 'Power', 'Language']",8.221911421911422,0.3333333333333333,0.0
